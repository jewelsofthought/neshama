<h3> What if I Return?</h3>

He is coming.
The excitement is rising.
Why, I do not know.
It is not that I have done anything so exciting.
It is just that I
Am an essential element.
Without me there, it cannot happen.

We have to come together again,
creating the synthesis
That we are meant to complete.
It is an harmonic convergence
That is necessary for the place to turn,
and turn it will.

Will I ever come back?
Will I ever be back?
I know I have to return
fulfilling my duty with my children and my wife.
Do I have a greater duty?
Is it a possible there is one? They
So need me, and love me â€“
they might need to follow to help
Fulfil their destinies too.

What if I return,
and know that is the place I am meant to be?
What if I call you?
Will you come?
Or will you blame me
Forever?
Will you be vindictive,  
say that I left, so you will not
Help me anymore?
Abandon me, as I have abandoned you, as
I abandoned R and S?
As I left O in tears feeling betrayed?
As I
Left my mother and motherland,
and have pined for it ever since,
knowing
I cannot return?

Will it stop?
Will I find my place,
and be somewhat satisfied? Or am I
Sentenced to wander forever,
whether I am in the right place, with the right
Person,
doing the right thing?

Release me, Oh my Lord,
to do your bidding,
to place myself at your service.
I am ready.
I will do
whatever
you need me for.
I have forever believed
In You,
and in Your Purpose,
and my fervent prayer has been to dedicate myself
To fulfilling that Purpose.

Help me, Oh Lord,
for i am weak and blind,
i need You to show me the
Way to my Salvation.

Hear whoever has the ears,
Your Lord, Our God, is One.

Amen.
