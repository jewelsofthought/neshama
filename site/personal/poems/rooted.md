I am rooted in the Divine.

My sustenance comes from the Light.
Although
I constantly seek the Light,
I remain rooted here
in darkness. For
it is in Darkness I grow,
and in darkness
that I feed from the Tree
containing the Divine Energy
of the earth itself.

I am the root of the Tree,
the Person that is continually changing,
not in my Nature,
but in what
it is becoming
through its relationship
with the world and its environment.

May the root
of my being
remain deeply embedded
in the depths
of my life
of who
and what
I am.

May they provide me
all my life
with the stability and nutrition
I need
in order to grow strong and bear much fruit.

Leaves rustling in the wind,
bathed in light,
dripping with water
from the rain.
Dying in the winter
being reborn in the summer
Like fingers splitting the sky.
They reach up and out,
roots in the heavens,
sharing the light
of the sun
with the rest of the tree.

This is the interface
between the light,
the heavens
and the trunk
Channelling the energy of the heavens,
which is the light within the tree.
Just like the roots,
which bring the energy of their darkness
into the trunk of the tree,
the heart that bridges the upper and the lower.
It is the place of love,
from whence I emerge into action in the world.

Rooted in the Divine,
my own roots are embedded in my life,
enabling me to receive the nourishment I need from Darkness.
My leaves, touching the Heavens, bring the Light into my heart.
