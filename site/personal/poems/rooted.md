<div class="poem">

I am rooted in the Divine.

Although my sustenance comes from the Light.
I remain rooted here in darkness.
It is in Darkness I grow,
and in darkness
that I feed from the Tree
containing the Divine Energy
of the earth itself.

I am the root of the Tree,
the leaves and branches continually changing,
in what I am becoming
through my relationship
with the world and its environment.

May the root
of my being
remain deeply embedded
in the depths
of the Truth
of who
and what
I am.

May these roots provide me
with the stability and nutrition
I need
in order to grow strong and bear much fruit.

&nbsp;&nbsp; \* \* \*

Leaves rustling in the wind,
bathed in light,
dripping with water
from the rain.
Dying in the winter
being reborn in the summer.
Part of the eternal cycle
of life and death.

Like fingers splitting the sky.
They reach up and out,
roots in the heavens,
sharing the light
of the sun
with the rest of me.

This trunk is is the interface
between the light of
the heavens
and the darkness of my roots .

I am the trunk,
channelling the light of the heavens,
bringing it down to nourish and speak
to all that I am, and all the beings that
feed off me.

Just as the roots,
embedded in the earth of my existence.
bring the energy of their darkness
up into my tree.
Thus I become the heart that bridges the upper and the lower,
In the place of the lover,
from whence I emerge into action in the world.
