## Out On A Limb

I’m afraid to go there.
Afraid to go against the advice of society.
Afraid to give up my well-paying job,
my security, what I’ve worked “up to”,
been educated for, dedicated my life to
and what I’m good at.

My heart pulls me in another direction.
It urges me to take flight
with new ideas and new ways of being.
I no longer can ignore these yearnings,
nor can I compartmentalize them
into one particular part of my life.
Spirit is calling and
I must answer the call.

I fear that if I flounder
they’ll have no mercy.
An image appears
of being out on a limb
extending over a cliff.
Society just watches
with knowing detachment
as I lose my grip
and fall to my death.

It is in the descent
that I release the bounds of ego
and surrender to my fate,
becoming aware.

In this awareness I find freedom.
I rediscover my wings.
I can only believe that if I have wings
I am meant to fly.

I knew, but had forgotten.
I can soar to new heights.
I can discover new worlds.
I can create my dreams
which far surpass my status quo.

My lack of trust holds me back.
In my fear of judgement
I have given energy to doubts and fears
and limiting beliefs
Find your wings and fly,
Soar to new heights that you alone
Can imagine...
