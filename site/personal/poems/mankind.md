<h3> I Mankind</h3>

In the midst of all the foment,
there is a deep calm.
We hear the call,
the sleeping lions, the men,
awaken.
No more bombs, we cry.

The women shudder with joy,
and excitement. The men
are coming, they whisper,
the men ARE coming.

Silent waves wash over the
borders; separation of
mind and body – a me and a
you. The I runs amok
in the panoply of noisy commercialism.

Our time has come.
Arise, Awaken, Surge forth to
build what needs to be built.

Do not forget the
women, my brothers,
for their Wisdom is the one
that will connect and nourish
us in our need.

In the glittering essence, in the
depths of existence, the Divine
plan glimmers.

Moaning arises in the midst
of the container “Hold me, hold
me – for I am angry”

Bend to the task, hold one
another. For together we
end it all - bringing to
fruition what is next.

Clear the plates, bring the food.
The next meal being no
different from the previous

unless you Bless it.
