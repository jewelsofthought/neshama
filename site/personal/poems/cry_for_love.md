<h3>Is it really all a cry for love?</h3>

> Oh mama
> Is this really the end
> To be stuck inside a mobile
> With the Memphis blues again?

We have no place to go but to love it.
This is what the Good Book has to say .

We become selfish
living in Babylon,

We had it all worked out once upon a Time.
Then what happened?
It’s all just a joke.

Life is a winding path,
we don't know
where the next bend will lead us.

How can we overcome
the pain and suffering?

By becoming rich,
says the one.

No, by becoming holy, says the other.
Reach for achieve nirvana,
where you will find everlasting bliss,
content in the bosom of your God.

Where do you go?

In the spiritual union
we are happy
yet the body calls –
I am hungry again, feed me.
How we serve it,
for we are weak
having not yet conquered
the fear of death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;\* \* \*

Dancing into ecstasy as a way of life.
Dancing as the Shamans danced.
Dancing like the yogis,
Dancing as we have danced for eons.

Dancing your happiness, your sadness, your journey,
dancing your madness away.

When did dancing become social
removed from the spiritual?

Perhaps when our lives stopped being a dance.

What if we returned to a life
that was lived as a dance,
one that had certain steps
crafted to bring us into trance?

Every dance has steps
once mastered,
joy can begin to be expressed
within the structure defined by these steps.

A structure that allows for the maximum amount of freedom,
and that is life.

We entice with the free form.
Just dance.

What is the call?
But the desire to experience another reality?

It is called Intentional Dance.
a form that starts with the focusing
of intention.

Always create a circle,
from within which to dance
start with prayer,
use visualization,
open to receiving the energy
give a gift of love,
closing with prayer.

As was the medicine wheel.

First the idea.

"I want to bless the land with a Medicine Wheel"

Then the High Priest facilitator,
with the logistics the necessary equipment and the people.
Then came the learning.
Sitting in circle, we became the rabbi's of the event,
reading and interpreting the writs.
Then delegate.
Gather, the rocks from the riverbed,
Ask permission,
Collect the grandfathers
place them in the form of the medicine wheel

amidst the sounds of drumming,

we began to dance and sing and laugh.
For the Lord is happy when His children are joyous
for this is how we express our enjoyment of His Creation.

It rained and it rained, for days afterwards.

I have to leave on my journey now.

My name is Anwhlunkyhvha –
pronounced Anwhalun¡ha
which means "I am of the earth".

Anyone who has loved unconditionally
will find the unbearable bliss of Eternity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;\* \* \*

Dancing through the letters,
activated on the grid,
sending a message.
That is at its most esoteric.

Dance away the week and the worries;
dance for joy, for life, and for our loved ones.
Dance in preparation for our journey
sending our intention to get closer to
the true, divine essence of our being
and that of the spirits around us.

Then we dance some
focusing our intention and our journey
on the goal.

To enter the temple of Shamanism,
the realm of conscious dance,
you might have to be a little uncomfortable.
Some call it initiation.
I call it preparation.

You have to go somewhere.

Brought up on _Beti Ha'Knessiot_,
_Asseret Ha'Dibrot_ and _Ha'Torah_
steeped in Chemistry, Physics
and Mathematics,
I still could not decide between right and wrong.
All I know is
an eternal tension
between the body and the spirit exists
and is alive in me.

The spirit as the Tao,
has no boundaries
living in the eternal present
of infinite potentialities.
The body,
aware and afraid
of its limits,
living in the past and
dreading the future.

Traversing the pathway
from mind to memory to mind
we pick up influences
from all the ten _sephirot_.

A coherent universe –
that is what it means
when we say God is One –
is fully connected,
thus obviously one part will vibrate/change
whenever there is a change in another.

With every breath you take,
you affect everything in the universe.

Reaching for coherency,
I end up with Chaos
equilibrium where nothing happens.
Everyone and everything
is in a state of bliss,
they do not need anything.

What we really want
is a state of order
that provides maximum freedom
for its constituents
like one of Mei’s living crystals.
A state of anxiety,
and ever continuing cycles.

Either you are in the one,
annihilated in the group mind,
or an individual spirit struggling
against the pull towards
the singular mind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;\* \* \*

Are you still able to delve into things?
Can you twist your mind around this?
Have you become so enwrapped
in the emotional madness of your existence
that you no longer have energy
to delve anymore?

Have you lost your faith?

The perfect balance is
when everyone is able
to express the Truth of their self.

Though we may not understand,
we have to
constantly strive,
believing in a coherent universe,
for these thoughts do make a
difference.

Each one of us,
ever spiralling
into a larger and larger group,
realizing
the need
for a basic change
in the way
we relate to ourselves
and to others.

As we have, for a long time.

In the midst of the madness that is Israel,
is the same madness that is happening in this
and many other parts of the world.-

You have to believe
that we can create
a more humane society.

You have to believe that we can
live in one in which we will not be killing
one another for any reason whatsoever.
That is where we have to start.

The call is from the jungle.
There are the predators that need to kill,
so we accept human predators,
both sanctioned and unsanctified.
As long as we kill to eat,
as long as we kill to survice,
it will continue,
all just part of the cycle of life.

No!
Just stop the killing!
Start there...

Then the violence, the abuse and the oppression...
will follow after.

Want to dance?
