<h3> In the Beginning... </h3>

Time is all we have.
It is the brief gift
We have become custodians of.
Too late I realise that Love
In action is Time.
The Time you spend,
Is always an expression
Of your love, except when bound.

we speak of Freedom.
But unconditional Freedom is
Like unconditional Love. It
Allows, perhaps even loves,
The darkness.

Ask, and ask again
As we fight to be liberated
From the density of the constraints
That prevent us from experiencing
our individual truth.

Yet, is not this
That I am experiencing
Actually my truth?
What in me is thinking
That thought in the first place?
Where does it all end?
בראשית ברא אלוהים…
‘In the beginning….’

Where is He, the Blessed Source?
