<div class="poem">

Aggressive with the vulnerable;
polite with those we are afraid of.

Core of destructiveness;
core of creativity.

The brighter the light,
the deeper the darkness.

If the Truth is unspoken,
the wounds can never heal.

The only way of getting out of something,
is to get into it consciously.

Remove the packet of energy.
The Creative energy will replace
what has been removed.

More exposure of the inner,
brings more presence to the outer.

What we don't own internally,
will manifest itself externally.

The Inner Chamber,
pocket of sub-conscious,
between effect and reaction,
the gap between action and re-action.

The extent to which we do not control our reaction,
is the extent to which we can be controlled.

If the spiritual enters this space,
we become uncontrollable.

What prevents this healing
is the eo that resides
in this space.
Invite the Divine to enter.
Pray for G-d/Holy Spirit/Allah
to clear that space.
Offer it up to the
Divine healing Power.
Only the Divine can heal.
We do not heal ourselves.
The Divine Light heals.

Healing being a form of creating light from darkness&mdash;
creating something where there was nothing.
Through forgiveness and gratitude,
we may be blessed to enter this portal.
