<div class="poem">

<h3> Now It Is</h3>

How I reel and writhe
in the mid night of my uncertainty.
Calling out to any that will hear
Bereft of all, deep in my aloneness
I hear no voices, see no purpose.

Sure I walked away,
Believing that this was my future
Now, I sit alone, and afraid.

Sadness and pain is my constant
companion. So sure was I that
this was right.

Where have I gone?
Where are you?

So sure I was when I began,
and now the nothingness,
the emptiness of my truth
taunts me.

I cannot see
Anything.
