<h3> From the storm to the connection</h3>

In the midst of the heaving storm,
There is a swirling vortex, that
Yaws around its central axis.
In the midst of its jaws, lies a body,
Gently rocking on his back,
Like a feather floating in the updraft
It hovers, lifting and sinking,
But still holding its position.

Waters lapping at the bowels of lust
Entering the Divine,
seeking Union with Beloved
vibrating with the vicissitudes of everything.

Encloaked in my aloneness,
My ego cries out for connection,
While my soul relishes the depth of the
Connection i have with You.
