## Lesson of the day

Let the true substance
of who you are
rain upon me.
That which was fashioned
in the deep dark places
of the Earth.

_Gimel_ teaches us
that two opposing forces must be blended to create
a third, more complete, more perfect entity.
Emanating from the singularity of the Aleph,
Combining with the duality of the Bet,
comes the synthesis known as Gimel.
Not the one, nor the other,
but a greater perfection through the synthesis
of the Oneness,
the Divine,
with the duality, or existence
– _Malchut_ –
kingdom of man and woman.
