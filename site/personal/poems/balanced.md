<div class="poem">
In the mistiness <br />
of my quietness,<br />
From the depths <br />
of my stillness,<br />
A feather drifts <br />
slowly to earth.<br />
Holding my breath,<br />
I feel subtle joy <br />
surrounding me.<br />
Calmer than ever, <br />
I sit<br />
Precariously balanced<br />
Between something<br />

& 
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-left: 2rem; font-size: 50%">
nothing.
</p>
