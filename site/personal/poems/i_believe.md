What meetings are possible in the angelic realm where actions are true?
Where a look accompanied by a tremor of excitement, can set a soul aflame.
That evening was full of surprises, clearing my projection,
The ego, special, non-sharing, shy of that part of me feeling exposed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;\* \* \*

Entering into the space of the Divine,
coming to terms with our nature.
To spread my wings and fly through balancing my masculine, purposeful,
and my feminine, receptive, desire for union.
To be free from the constraints
of the programming
of my past—the pull of my ancestors;
release the constrains and express the light and love of my inner being.
For men, everything is experienced as other,
thus his strong need for union.
For women, aware of the union of everything,
knowing of no difference between herself and another,
constantly being battered on the rocks of the male’s state of separateness.

The energy fusing with the material is the sexual realm of the upper world.
The “descent” of the spirit into manifest form is the expression of the sexual in the spiritual space
we are referring to.
The sexual act is our primal entrance into the spiritual.
Perhaps the feminine rises and the man descends.
Woman is filled, Man is emptied by the orgasm.
Woman’s encounter is with the infinite fullness, man is with the infinite emptiness.
The man encounters the Divine through the emptiness of life; the woman through the fullness of birth
The mystery of death is that which provides the fullness of life.
On the one hand death as the purveyor of all evil in this world, the signifier of all impurity.
Yet only by overcoming death can we enter into the mystical realm.
A hero’s journey, in which we have to pass through the valley of death,
and emerge, with faith alone, and G!d at your side.
Only by encountering the energy of death, and overcoming it by choosing life,
by discovering what means more to you than death.
Thus I ask, “What is that?”
I thought it was love. But I have too many ashes now on the altar of love.
I thought it was G!d. But I am tired of calling into the cold night as I struggle through my own blind darknesses.
Yet in the depth of the darkness, You respond to me.
I believe, i Believe
