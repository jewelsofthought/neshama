<div class="poem">

<h3>-- The Infinite Desire --</h3>

Pain reeks across my being
I smell it all around me
Surrounded by sounds and laughter
I tremble in awe.

The manifold scintillating universe
Flirting and laughing
Creating and celebrating life
I explode and enfold
Assembling and disassembling
Entwined in a (semblance) of continuity.

Trembling in the midst of eternity
Writhing in the snake of existence
We emerge and are swallowed
Always looking at what we desire
For what we cannot see
Only intimate, far-off knowings.

I am surrounded by infinite Love
I know. I know, the knowing swirling around
As thick as the very material of being.
I know the gap between the Knowing and the struggling
Incurling to the center of my being
The very core of our existence, where all is One.
