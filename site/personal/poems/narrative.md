Just like the intrepid explorers of yore,
venturing into the dark hidden areas of the world,
lost in the wilderness, they broke into two segments.

The first group built walls, continuing what is known.
The other group acknowledged the truth.
The old ways are dying, and we need
to find a new narrative. So...

<div class="poem">
Be still, be quiet
Stay where you are
and listen,
listen carefully
and soon you will hear
the sound.
It is not a voice,
and has no melody.
But, if you breathe
and quiet those voices
clamouring for attention,
like unkempt children,
you will hear the quiet,
oh, so quiet.
A song, like the
waves of the ocean, that
permeats everything.
Follow the song,
Do not move till
you hear it, for,
hidden in its melody,
if you receive its soul,
is a voice&mdash;a message.

Who is the messenger&mdash;
you may and should ask.
What language will it speak?
You, of course, can only hear
with symbols you comprehend,
but what does the messenger receive?
What is this English that we speak of?
His mode and method of speech is
completely different from ours&mdash;
so different that we cannot even
imagine what it might be.
