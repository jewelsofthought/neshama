<div class="poem">

The need for sacred union,
Deep desire for the beloved
unfound,
Something moves in spirit.
True Union
occurs in the upper realms,
Union with another
occurs in the physical realms,
the bonded union,
consecrated in the lower realm,
is the space
from which life emerges.

Oh, simply being,
we are called
to the darkness,
for there you find life,
Not another alone,
but your own.

Only in the depths
of your existence,
can you find the Source
for G-d remains hidden.
We have to learn to see
the light in the darkness.

The golden path strikes
like a predator,
and descends upon you,
like a bolt of lightning,
and you awaken (or not).

Most times we trudge, step by step,
day by day, moment by moment, searching,
hoping, praying, calling
like lost sheep.

For those who can be quiet,
in the midst of the braying,
finding rest within the constant
noise of action&mdash;
and in those precious moments of peace,
perhaps The Voice is heard - with ears
normally attuned to the clamour of life.
Aah, to see with eyes
that have been taught to see,
and hear with ears that have become
attuned to silence that speaks.

It is a Siren call &ndash; full of life
and lust. Follow it &ndash;
and it will always lead to
where you will be blessed
with the sacred gift
of choice...

Choose the darkness,
it will with remain with you
like a lover
that will never leave,
and eventually you will become
so bonded, that you will have no
choice but to become its slave.

Pray that one day you awaken,
and realise that you are worthy
of redemption,
unless the lightning bolt
of _mazal_ blesses you
and you are released, like a man
suddenly sprung from a prison of
your own making.

Choose the light, and it will guide you,
and challenge you to your core.
It will remain with you,
as long as you remain humble
and faithful,
grateful to be blessed
with the fruit that falls from
the Tree of Life.
