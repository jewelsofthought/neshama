<div class="poem">

<h3>Begin in the present moment</h3>

I am rooted in the Divine.
My sustenance comes from the Light.
Although I seek It all the time,
I remain rooted here in the darkness.
For it is in the darkness that I grow.
In darkness I feed the tree
From the Divine energy of the earth itself

I am the root
of the tree
of the person
that is continually changing,
not from in its nature,
but in what it is
and its relationship
with the world
and its environment.

May the roots of my being
remain deeply embedded
in the depths of my life
and who and what I am,
the _mi_ & _ma_ of my life.
May they provide me
with the stability
and nutrition I need
in order to grow strong
and bear much fruit.
