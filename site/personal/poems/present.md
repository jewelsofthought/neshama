## Begin in the present moment

      I am rooted in the Divine.
      My sustenance comes from the Light.
      Although I seek It all the time,
      I remain rooted here in the darkness.
      For it is in the darkness that I grow.
      In darkness I feed the tree
      From the Divine energy of the earth itself

      I am the root
      of the tree
      of the person
      that is continually changing,
      not from in its nature,
      but in what it is
      and its relationship
      with the world
      and its environment.

      May the roots of my being
      remain deeply embedded
      in the depths of my life
      and who and what I am.
      (The _mi_ &amp; _ma_ of my life.)
      May they provide me
      with the stability
      and nutrition I need
      in order to grow strong
      and bear much fruit.
