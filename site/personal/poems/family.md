<div class="poem">

Lying in bed,
I cannot rise.
It is as if I am lead,
weighted down,
Or rather,
unlifted, unlightened,
for the love of the children I stay
Here.
She speaks of your anger,
and with her Sight she is so right.

Having recreated my mother,
how do I leave?
The same conundrum
That I faced, to run,
instead of fighting my demons.
How foolish.
How I justified it
Now I
am so far from my family,
from my heritage,
from my history,
that I shall never make it back.
God forgive me.

How sad,
that I need to dig for friends
like the gold seekers.
I wish for Peace,
for the ability to be,
yet the shoe does not fit.
However I try to
Make it, I know it is not right.

Play all the mind games
I want,
read and practice all the New Age Philosophy around,
but it is inside, it burns, it breaks and
I have denied
It for so long now,
It has no effect.

Looking around
I try to justify it,
as I justified all my crimes against morality--
For which I have to ask forgiveness.

It is here and now I
have to straighten
My walk,
though by the time it is straightened,
I fear all my love will be gone.

Fearing the future,
for the error has propagated,
I lie in bed,
the noise of the family,
Reverberating through the house.
One yelling, another shouting back, a third wailing in
The backgroundâ€¦
my family, my pain, my transgressions.
