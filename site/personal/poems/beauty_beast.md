<div class="poem">

Sitting at the coffee shop in Gloucester.
Having many thoughts on the journey here.
Thoughts about sex
& the manâ€™s desire
to devour the female;
where he becomes predator
and
she the prey.

How in our relationship
you were the male in sex,
the aggressor and I was your
bitch.

This kept you safe
and in control
But it emasculated me.

So, I expressed my masculinity
through the others. Where
I can again be the predator
and devour some prey.

I can retain,
or attain,
some modicum
of sexual control.

Now having sated our hunger, we move onto something else.

You, the woman,
want intimacy
and love.

So do I!

But

if we cross a threshold
and we open physically
and I feel your love,
it will trigger my beast,
&
I will transform from my Hyde to my Jekyll.
Thus you become the cause and the tormentor of my beast.
