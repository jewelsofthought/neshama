The expectation of a loved one
understanding my thoughts, my needs
without my having to tell her, or explain.
Just like a mother…

And my disappointment when
that expectation is not met,
turning love into anger,
which hides the sadness,
which hides the fear –
Am I ever going to find my soul mate,  
the one that will see into the depths of my core –
And Know me?

There is only One who can do that.

The space between is opaque,
I cannot read your thoughts,
though I can read your emotions.
It takes observation and empathy.
I have to be open to receive.

It might take a lifetime
to find that inner calmness,
the fullness of a peace
that allows me to be open
fully.

It is confusing.
I can “hear” my thoughts so clearly,
why can’t you?

If I wish to communicate my thoughts,
the best way is to clothe them in a story,
or a narrative – an adventure
that will awaken your emotions and feelings.
Thus I create a density,
weaving a bridge between us
that is filled with images and feelings.
This is the material
with which the space between is moulded,
the material
that makes up
the landscape
through which I transmit
my thoughts
and
my feelings
to my Beloved.
