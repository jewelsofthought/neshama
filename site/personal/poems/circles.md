<h3>Distant memories</h3>

Life consists of concentric circles,
Circles around a center point,
each circle joined
On a different level, forming the spiral of life.

So sad to be leaving you my beloveds.
Our memories
Are more ancient than the history
that is taught in schools.
Your majesty and beauty will inspire me,
remembering that
From one tiny seed you have grown
to tower proudly above us.

My prayer goes with you,
that the Mighty Spirit will look after you,
and
Keep you from harm.
My faith says
that you will be here for a long time yet,
I hope that I may once again walk amongst your brothers and sisters,
breathing
In the air and the odour that comes only from you.
