<div style="margin-left: 2.5rem">

Within the fluid harmonies
That form the music of the spheres,
You searched for me
And, having found me,
You knew me.

With the harmonies all around,
You search for me
And you know me

Whatever path I walk
You enclothe me
You already know
All my ways.

When I descend
And when I rise,
You know me.
You understand my thoughts
Before I think them.

As the energy from behind,
And in front, You try me.
Cloaked in your Divine Web,
You laid Your hand on me
Such knowing is too much,
Too wonderful. It is so high,
I cannot attain it.

Where can I not be in Your presence?
Where are You not?

If I ascend to the heavens,
Or make my bed in the earth
You are there.

Were I to have had the wings of the morning
Or dwelt in the depths of the ocean,
I would still be held by your hand.

Even the darkness
cannot hide
from You.
Night shines like day,
For the darkness
And the light
Are both the same
to You

When I was enshrouded
In Darkness
And it covered me
Then even the Dark
Will be as light
Around me.

You laid the tracks
Of my life,
Just as I emerged
From the womb of
my mother, fearfully and
wonderfully made.

My soul knows how awesome
are your works.

I will praise You
lifting my voice and body
In songs of Joy.
