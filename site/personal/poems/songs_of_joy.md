Within the fluid resonances
That form the rhythm of the spheres,
in the music that reverberates in the
dance of the universe,
You searched for me
And, having found me,
You knew me.

With the harmonies all around,
You search for me
And you know me

You know me when I descend
to the lower realms, and You
know me when I am exploring
in the upper ones. You
understand my thoughts
even before I am aware of them.

You enclothe the path I walk,
You are with me when I lie down.
You are already acquainted with
All my ways.

When I descend
And when I rise,
You know me.
You understand my thoughts
Before I think them.

For there is not a word, oh Lord,
that is not You. Every word, oh Lord,
You know more completely than I
could ever imagine.

You challenge me as the
energy that gathers from behind
and from in front,
from my past and from my future.

Cloaked in Your Divine Web,
like a gossamer cloud,
You laid Your hand on me.
Such knowing is too much,
Too wonderful. It is so high,
I cannot attain it, even
as I reach up for it.

Where can I hide from Your presence?
Where is a place that are You not?

If I ascend to the heavens,
You are there! Or make my bed
in the darkness of the earth,
You are there.

Were I to fly on the wings of the morning
Or dwell in the depths of the ocean,
even there will I be led by your hand,
and held by your might.

The darkness
cannot hide
from You.
Night shines like day,
For the darkness
And the light
Are both the same
to You.

You laid the tracks
along which my life unfolds,
Just as I emerged
From the womb of
my mother

I will praise Thee,
and lift up my voice and body in
songs of joy, for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made.
Yout works are so awesome,
so marvellous that my soul
shudders with songs of awe.

My substance is not hidden
from You, even when I was made
in secret and curiously wrought
in the lowest parts of the earth.

Your eyes saw my substance, even as it was,
imperfect. For in Your book all
substances are written, even the days
in which they are to be fashioned&mdash;every
one of them.

Each of Your thoughts are precious to me.
Each time I see one, I realise how great
is the sum of all of You. If I could count
them, they would be a number larger than
any I could imagine.

When I am awake, I am still with Thee.

Search me, O G!d, and know my heart;
try me, and know my thoughts. For I open
myself and my heart to You.

Look, and if there is any untruth in me,
grace me with Your Way. For all my
wanderings come from the images of other,
of idols and that is the only pain I feel.

In the gap between my knowing and You
is where my darkness lies.

If in my deepest substance,
that dust from which I was wrought,
I can see the might wherein that miracle
grew. For in that miracle lies the
mystery of Your essence, and the
wonder of Your Creation.

Even that pales in comparison to the true
delight of Your being. The ecstasy of the
"I am that I am" as seen from the
space of the "I am what I am" &ndash;
the constrained impurity.

I am the interface wherein it moves
from uncountable to countable. I am
the bridge between the finite and
the Infinite, the expression of the infinite
seeking its (in)finite self.

<p>
1. For the Leader. A Psalm of David. O LORD, You have searched me, and known me.
</p>
<p>
2. You know my downsitting and my uprising, You understand my thought afar off.
</p>
<p>
3. You measure my going about and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.
</p>
<p>
4. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, You know it altogether.
</p>
5. You have hemmed me in behind and before, and lain Your hand upon me.
<p>
</p>
6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; too high, I cannot attain unto it.
</p>
<p>
7. Whither shall I go from Your spirit? Whither shall I flee from Your presence?
</p>
<p>
8. If I ascend up into heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in the nether-world, behold, You are there.
</p>
<p>
9. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
</p>
<p>
10. Even there would Your hand lead me, and Your right hand would hold me.
</p>
<p>
11. And if I say: 'Surely the darkness shall envelop me, and the light about me shall be night';
</p>
<p>
12. Even the darkness is not too dark for You, but the night shines as the day; the darkness is even as the light.
</p>
<p>
13. For You have made my reins; You have knitted me together in my mother's womb.
</p>
<p>
14. I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
wonderful are Your works; and that my soul knows well.
</p>
<p>
15. My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
</p>
<p>
16. Your eyes sew my unformed substance, and in Your book they were all written—even the days that were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
</p>
<p>
17. How weighty also are Your thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!
</p>
<p>
18. If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand; were I to come to the end of them, I would still be with You.
</p>
<p>
19. If You but would slay the wicked, O God--depart from me therefore, you men of blood;
</p>
<p>
20. Whoso speaks Your name with wicked thought, they take it for falsehood, even Your enemies—
</p>
<p>
21. Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate You? And do not I strive with those that rise up against You?
</p>
<p>
22. I hate them with utmost hatred; I count them my enemies.
</p>
<p>
23 Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts;
</p>
<p>
24 And see if there be any way in me that is grievous, and lead me in the way everlasting.
