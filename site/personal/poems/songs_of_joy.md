Within the fluid resonances
That form the rhythm of the spheres,
in the music that reverberates in the
dance of the universe,
You searched for me
And, having found me,
You knew me.

With the harmonies all around,
You search for me
And you know me

You know me what I descend
to the lower realms, and You
know me when I am flying
in the upper ones. You
understand my thoughts
even before I am aware of them.

You enclothe the path I walk,
You are with me when I lie down.
You are already acquainted with
All my ways.

When I descend
And when I rise,
You know me.
You understand my thoughts
Before I think them.

For there is not a word, oh Lord,
that is not You. Every word, oh Lord,
you know more completely than I
could ever imagine.

You challenged me as the
energy that gathers from behind
and from in front, from my past and from my future.

Cloaked in your Divine Web,
like a gossamer cloud,
You laid Your hand on me.
Such knowing is too much,
Too wonderful. It is so high,
I cannot attain it, even
as I reach up for it.

Where can I hide from Your presence?
Where is a place that are You not?

If I ascend to the heavens,
You are there! Or make my bed
in the darkness of the earth,
You are there.

Were I to fly on the wings of the morning
Or dwell in the depths of the ocean,
even there will I be led by your hand,
and held by your might.

The darkness
cannot hide
from You.
Night shines like day,
For the darkness
And the light
Are both the same
to You.

You laid the tracks
along which my my life unfolds,
Just as I emerged
From the womb of
my mother

I will praise Thee,
and life up my voice and body in
songs of joy, for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made.
You works are so awesome,
so marvellous that my soul
shudders with songs of awe.

My substance is not hidden
from You, even when I was made
in secret and curiously wrought
in the lowest parts of the earth.

Your eyes saw my substance, even as it was,
imperfect. For in Your book all
substances are written, even the days
in which they are to be fashioned&mdash;every
one of them.

Each of Your thoughts are precious to me.
Each time I see one, I realise how great
is the sum of all of You. If I could count
them, they would be a number larger than
any I could imagine.

When I am awake, I am still with Thee.

Search me, O G!d, and know my heart;
try me, and know my thoughts. For I open
myself and my heart to You.

Look, and if there is any untruth in me,
grace me with Your Way. For all my
wanderings come from the images of other,
of idols and that is the only pain I feel.

In the gap between my knowing and You, is where
my darkness lies.

If in my deepest substance,
that dust from which I was wrought,
I can see the might wherein that miracle
grew. For in that miracle lies the
mystery of Your essence, and the
wonder of creation.

Even that pales in comparison to the true
delight of Your being. The ecstasy of the
"I am that I am" as seen from the
space of the "I am what I am" &ndash; The
constrained impurity.

<p style="text-align: center">
I am the interface wherein it moves<br />
from uncountable to countable. I am<br /> 
the bridge between the finite and<br />
the Infinite, the expression of the infinite<br />
seeking its (in)finite self.<br />
