 למה תשׁקלוּ כסף בלוא־לחם ויגעכם בלוא לשׂבעה שׁמעוּ שׁמוע אלי ואכלוּ־טוב ותתענג בדשׁן נפשׁכם.

 Why do you weigh out money for that which is not bread and offer the fruits of your toil for that which does not satisfy your soul?

> Bezalel knew the “Art of combining sacred letters with which heaven and earth were created and blessed. A degree of wisdom similar to that with which G!d created the universe.”

In the realm of Spirit one cannot measure.
The Mekubalim speak of a klipa (קליפה) – a skin or barrier,
a membrane between the two.
These speaks of the gap,
a space between,
a “neighbourhood of change”.
The place where the mystical,
the vision, has
enough of the Will of G!d,
the creative energy,
and desire,
to become dense enough to manifest.

Wisdom, the spirit of Ruach Ha'Kadosh (רוח הקודשׁ) descends upon me.
It requires Insight,
the derivation of new ideas &
deductions from one’s own Knowledge,
which we often acquire from others.
Wisdom wells up from the depths,
silently speaking of vistas dreamt of,
half-heard in the stillness
between two waves.

What if galaxies are like cells of the body of Elohim.

Intricate webs twirl between,
Each thoroughly connected.

The inner beast needs to devour everything;
Being human is constraining those desires,
And the highest form of this is
constraint in service to the Divine.
The higher form of feelings
will be not be through devouring
But through serving.
Each serving that which is greater,
Until we are serving that which is greater
Than all of us.

Programmed with the desire to emulate the Divine.
How absurd a thought -
To create something other than Myself,
Then program it with the drive to be just like Me!
Infinite only exist if there is finite,
How that infinite becomes finite, is a mystery.
Yet the deepest mystery is _ex nihilo_&mdash;
How the supernal, inexpressible, non-existent Nothingness “stirred”.
How could ‘no-thing’ stir up ‘some-thing’?
Why would Nothing need something to Know It?
This is beyond our understanding.
The Union with the Beloved is to Know the Beloved.
Thus we can only Know It.

May my Beloved be beside me always.
May we lie in the fields of sun, laughing and playing
All the days of our lives.
May all that we are and all that we do be fruitful and multiply,
May I be awed by Your Beauty till the day I die.
May I honour each and every day
That is blessed by you.
For without You my life would be extinguished
in a moment.
