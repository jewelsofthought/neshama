In the realm of Spirit one cannot measure.
The _Mekubalim_ speak of a _klipa_ ([קליפה]{dir="rtl"}),
a (mem)brane between the two.
This speaks of the space between,
a "neighbourhood of change"
where vision has,
through the Will of **HaShem**,
the creative energy
and desire
to become dense enough to manifest.

The spirit of _Ruach Ha'Kadosh_ ([רוח הקודשׁ]{dir="rtl"}) descends upon me.
Insight, the spark of new ideas from one's own Knowing,
attuned by that of others.
Wisdom wells up from the depths,
silently speaking of vistas dreamt of,
"half-heard in the stillness
between two waves."

What if galaxies are like cells of the body of _Elohim_.

Intricate webs twirl between,
Each thoroughly connected.

The inner beast needs to devour everything;
  {It is the will of G-d that devours everything. As your will is (and can only be) an expression of the Will of G-d, it also wishes to devour everything. It's drive is to make everything like it! Nietzsche referred to it as the "Will to Power". Is that not the fundamental drive of every being, yet caught up in the Dharmic Wheel of [its own] life? The _Netzach_ and _Hod_ dynamic, rather like the _Yin_ and _Yang_ one, representing uniquely by the Dao symbol }
Being human is constraining those desires,
And the highest form of this is
constraint in service to the Divine.
The higher form of feelings
will be not be through devouring
But through serving.
Each serving that which is greater,
Until we are serving that which is greater
Than all of us.

Programmed with the desire to emulate the Divine.
How absurd a thought -
To create something other than Myself,
Then program it with the drive to be just like Me!
Infinite only exist if there is finite,
How that infinite becomes finite, is a mystery.
Yet the deepest mystery is _ex nihilo_&mdash;
How the supernal, inexpressible, non-existent Nothingness "stirred".
How could 'no-thing' stir up 'some-thing'?
Why would Nothing need something to Know Anything?
This is beyond our understanding.
The Union with the Beloved is to Know the Beloved.
Thus we can only Know It.

May my Beloved be beside me always.
May we lie in the fields of sun, laughing and playing
All the days of our lives.
May all that we are and all that we do be fruitful and multiply,
May I be awed by Your Beauty till the day I die.
May I honour each and every day
That is blessed by you.
For without Your Love my life would be extinguished
in a moment.
