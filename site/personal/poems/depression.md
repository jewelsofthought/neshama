Depression comes from being stuck in the doorway.

Perhaps the door is shut,
and you cannot find the key.
Maybe a clue is what you are missing.
Maybe it is about you not being good enough.
It is in the awareness of the unknown
into which we are walking.

Perhaps the door is open
but you cannot pass through.
It is like a force field
that prevents you.
You can see what is on
the other side&mdash;but
you cannot crossover.
There is a key,
you know... but
you cannot find it.
It is self-destructive
Not believing that you too,
can shine.

It has an emotional, and
energetic effect.
It is a metaphor,
symbolising crossing over.
It manifests as depression
when blocked. Or anxiety&mdash;
seeing the possible future;
a place to go; something else.
The mental "If you walk through
that door...!"

This also manifests as the sphere
of influence surrounding the
physical doorway
like the Vesuvian man.

The emergence of the realisation
of the spheres of influence; things
hinted, an awakening to the hidden
that contains...

the secret, the mystery, the spiritual.
An awakening to the incredible dance within
which we find ourselves. The awe, tinged with
terror, that this awareness brings.

It is all available, all necessary, all us.
A feeling that is associated with external
things&mdash;the first step into the realm of
heart.
