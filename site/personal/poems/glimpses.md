<div class="poem">

<h3> Glimpses</h3>

All my life you have given me glimpses,
brought me close, but something
has come about for it to crumble.

Do I not want to accept it?
To fail the final test?

What is it to be?
You are deeply embedded
Your talons digging deeply into my being
Razor sharp, to extract your desires
From yourself.

In the mistiness of my quietness
From the depth of my stillness
A feather drifts slowly to earth
Holding my breath
subtle joy surrounds me.

Calmer than ever,
I sit, precariously balanced
Between something and nothing.
