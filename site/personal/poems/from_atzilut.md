## From Atzilut to Malchut.

At the “emergence” of the point (_Atzilut_), the fractal nature of the world has already encoded the “DNA” of the universe. The idea had already been formed and someone, or something, some energy, has somehow stopped to design it.
Through a supreme effort of will, it moves,  
entering the space through the hole in the middle.
A line from the center forms,
the breath is inserted into the space
through the hole made by the centre point
awakening each point on the line,
to its existence,
each moment is activated
dancing in the space apportioned it.
Moving in the space,
as an energy that writhes like a whiplash,
a broken electrical cable jerking around in the road.
flailing in this space (Beriah), we get the shape,
To form something, it begin to “stabilise”.
Taking its space, holding its place.
In this realm, it needs the angels
to fashion and maintain it,
curtailing the flailing line,
creating shapes.
We call it _Yetzirah_.
Out of which there is a structure,
a metatron, that underlies
every organism, every organisation –
a web of interactions, contained
in a single thought.
