## Sexual realm

The energy fusing with the material is the sexual realm of the upper world. The "descent" of the spirit into manifest form is the expression of the sexual in the spiritual space we are referring to.

For us, the sexual act is a possible entrance into the spiritual. For the woman, when in love, it is. For the man it seems to be more of a descent. The feminine ascends, and the masculine descends. Woman is "filled", man is "emptied". Woman encounters the infinite through the fullness, a fullness that fills the emptinesses that she wrangles with. Man encounters the divine through the emptiness - the emptiness that removes his ego, allowing him to hear the rousing silence.

Woman needs security and a firm foundation to hold her as she traverses the universal space.

## F\*ck\*\*\*

Male wants the female for sex. That is a driving imperative. If he is "pure" male, then he would (if allowed) have a no nonsense approach. He would rip off her clothes and f\*ck.

In order to make the experience worthwhile and for the upliftment and pleasure of both parties, to make the journey last, he needs "diversion". He has to "miss the mark", otherwise it is game over in a short time. Thus he needs to insert time into the experience, which equals creativity.

That is what love introduces into the experience, the willingness and desire to spend time to make sure that the outcome is positive for them both. The way to uplift both parties and especially the feminine is through love of his partner, and ideally he would see in her the feminine Divine. He sees feminine energy everywhere, and, in his response, will change things in her environment.

Love is when he sees her manifest in the objects around him.

What if she just wants sex too, and not complicate it with the demand of love. This should balance things out, but it does not seem to. In that case, often it is the man that is hurt, and will end up referring to her as a slut.

Woman controls man through sex, unless the man has enslaved her sexually, generally by overpowering physically or by means of societal controls. On the individual scale, it is emotional power that will stop him taking her, whereas on the communal scale it is social and legal pressures.

If she manages to control his sexual imperative, he will become sexually disconnected and unhappy, as he is not in tune with his own life force, just as she will under similar control.

## Sex with

Nobody has the right to tell anyone else who they can or cannot have sex with, beyond the natural constraints of sex between adults. If my truth is, in the moment, that my desire for this person is real and soulful, and I do not express that due to guilt, I am not being authentic. I am then acting out of fear&mdash;especially fear of consequences.

What meetings are possible in the angelic realm where actions are true? Where a look, accompanied by a tremor of excitement, can set a soul alight.

## Female

If you accept the fact that you are young and beautiful, and every man is going to try want you, in one way or another&mdash;you will be more able to determine and control what goes on around you. All I say is - be gracious. Only use what you have to to get what you need. Don't be cruel.

## Coitus

The only truly heterosexual sexual act is vaginal penetration. All the rest are "diversions", and should be for the the pleasuring of the both parties.
