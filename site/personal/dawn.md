Awaking at dawn for no reason, l realize why we wake just before dawn to say the morning prayers. It is the time when the light first enters the darkness and parallels the creation which contains the mystery of the light and darkness, speaking of the darkness as that which existed before creation, and the light as the expression of the vitality of the Presence. This principle is of the highest order, in that the Presence does not move, or express itself in any form or fashion that we might be capable of comprehending. Only a quality, or appellation of Its presence could we ever comprehend, or indeed, even experience.

As the light gathers, and slowly, majestically, elegantly and gracefully begins to penetrate the darkness of the night, garbed and adorned in all her joy, twinkling and flirtatious, as the day could never be, so did the Will of G!d, b'h, gather to manifest the creation. In the same manner we gather our intention, our will prior to manifesting in this realm. It is like the seed about to burst, the egg on the verge of cracking. And the thoughts you are thinking will affect the waters of your day.

If what you thought could manifest in your day, and this is decided by the wisdom of the lord, which is far greater than any could apprehend, it will. If not then it gathers in the pool of its manifestation. When this pool gets full, it will overflow and begin to travel down the tree of manifestation, until, unless prevented by the guardians of the heavens, it will begin to express itself in this world.

Is it the same with your emotions? One student asked. And what about your actions? Another might query.

Well, that is why we come to the place of the dawn prayer, which preferably must begin before it is light, just as it begins to gather, say 10 or 15 minutes before dawn. The prayer speaks of G!d's greatness. It extols His glory. And prays that we be spared from the influence of the lamp of darkness, that we not be overcome by the evil tongue and that our enemies of spirit be kept far away. It calls to us to focus on the Divine Presence. Firstly in us, and in our environment, and prepare us for its unveiling through the magnificence of the emerging light.

But here, through the prayer and our gathering focus on the Divine light, we empty our emotional waters, allowing the peace of His presence to bathe and cleanse them. Our actions are similarly simple and direct. We invoke the morning gratitude and wash our hands, and pray. We cleanse our space and place our prayer shawl on our head and shoulders to "shield us under thy mighty wings". Now we are ready for the binding. We have bowed to Your Will, and invoke your mercy and protection and accept the yoke of your teaching and once again swear to abide by your commandments, for you are our salvation - and as we swear our oath we bind our forearm , and place portions of the scroll to cover our third eye, with the laying of the specially prepared leather tefillin --as they are called.

The day has dawned, and having seeded it in this manner, the light that first enters, the prime order night

He occupied, or possessed, רכש, the middle. In order to create the middle required some emanation, thus it says he " emanated the emanations". But it was from the middle that that was done.
