## Lyn (2016)

I just want to express my gratitude for what we shared together. For the gift of offering and opening your home and your heart to me. For being willing to embark with me on and share the journey of our lives so deeply. You will always remain a part of my life. You helped me go through a transition, one which you were a mirror of and for me and for you. For me, it is always a humbling and awe inspiring event in and for my life when I meet someone with whom I can go so deeply and so intimately so immediately. It is immense and for that I will always be grateful. I just want you to know how appreciative I am of all that you gave and received. I am honored and was deeply nurtured by all that occurred between us.

I am not meant to share this, because it will be feeding the energy of love between us, which is forbidden according to the code of honor that is a requirement of a shared and committed life, a life filled with principles and honor as defined by our culture. But I will do so anyways, and know that I do it in another dimension, a place of other, than what is required to be in this world realm, because I rather that, than dishonour what we had with spirit. But we can justify any action anyway, so it also boils do an to that I want to share with you in my gratitude.

Each time I enter your car, I breathe in your smell. I think and thank you while driving and send out thoughts of love and joy. No wonder you felt me at times.

## Monogamy (2016)

All my life I wanted to share with my partner any dalliances with other woman that I wanted to do, or did. And I had that for a long time. Then I fell deeply in love with a South African woman, who has insisted that I remain monogamous, and it is only since I had a couple of affairs, and she totally freaked out, that I have been considering having discreet affairs totally disconnected from my life ala last tango in Paris.

So, when the woman said hello,to me as I walked by Pima proverb in camps bay, and I responded, noticing her friend trying to get a peek at me, I knew what this was about. They were two women on holiday looking for some action. I continued on because I had made arrangements to meet with Jenn and rob, and was already running a bit late. Upon approaching the car, I could still feel their pull, and was considering cancelling and entering this tête-à-tête.

As I drove away, I looked into my feelings. I should be feeling proud of myself for not succumbing to the temptation, instead I felt more that once again spirit was offering me an adventure that I was denying, because of comfort.

I could have returned to the place, had a cup of coffee, and then excuse myself, and make an arrangement to meet tomorrow evening. It is what I am trying to do now, and that is step into the world as a man and take charge of my life - and accept responsibility for another's.

## The Beast & The Angel (Poem)

In the bowels of the beast sleeps an angel
Tread lightly little one
Speak softly woman of the wild
Remove all your clothes.
You may enter His chamber naked
as the day you were born
for every covering
will He tear
from your tremulous grip.

Kneel.
Eyes downcast, naked breasts shining,
legs spread, offering Him access
to your most secret places.
Breathe deeply,
even though your heart might be fluttering.
Is it fear or is it excitement?
Breathe again.
As you feel His attention
focusing on you
your body
begins to melt.  
It awakens
to meet the energy
flowing over it,
nipples rising and
a slight shiver
running up and down your spine.
Knowing that the only weapon
you have
to subdue the beast is buried
deep in the core
of your womanhood.
Only when he has torn away
all of its coverings
laid you bare,
will He allow you close.
The sudden first touch sears you
and you gasp.
Quiet little one.
Breathe again.
It is just the start.

## This is the way i look at it. (m&f)

It is about spending time in sacred space. Because it is only there you can encounter your beloved. Think of it as Her boudoir.

Beware if you encounter Her or any of her angels anywhere else for that will then herald a cataclysmic, life changing event, a '_Hineni_' moment.

Women can do that anywhere, not needing much to open those gates. Men need direction and protocols. They need daily practice, preferably following a certain routine. Women are naturally timekeepers as they have their built in clocks. Men need rituals and nature to remind them. Unfortunately they can also be used to bind them.

But that is essentially why a lot of the rituals are man made. It is often a struggle for the man to be uplifted by the feminine form of the ritual, yet more often than not the women can be uplifted by the male form.

That is why it is as a reward that the soul is born as woman. She has an innate connection with the Divine, which she can deny, with its associated results - which is a whole discussion on its own. She is often called to selfless service like a _bhodisattva_.

In this time of flux, the women are at the forefront of the emerging structure. However this may be because few men are stepping forward to lead for in her heart this is what she truly desires - so that she may continue providing her loving care to those around her. _Eshet chayal_, we call her - the woman warrior.

As the groups became bound more to protocols, they lost the connection between the rituals as an expression of natural cycles, and they became an expression of the structure of the communities instead. Constantly available light is one of the obvious examples of this, providing us a space totally removed from the darkness surrounding us. It is perhaps our fear of death that propels us in this direction as it provides us with the incentive to excel, to be remembered and thus become immortalized...

## Compete

You cannot compete with the man - not in his territory, where he is strong. You have to lead him into the spaces that you (f) are powerful.

That is the Achilles heel of the feminine movement. If you want to prove that you are equal to man, you have to show equality in all things. If we do a basic analysis of this, we will find the woman will come up short in some very relevant cases. And if you do a basic analysis of man, you will find he will come up short in some cases too.

But if the woman wants to equal the man in power, she will have a difficult fight. Because he is more physically powerful than her. The feminine's purpose is not power, whereas it is a drive of the masculine's.

If you fight me, we both lose. If you nourish me, we both win.

I know it is the same for you.

## Dream (2016-03-23)

Remember part where Hogsback house falls down. Had been having difficulties with people and the place. But it was a house made from stone and brick, with wooden circular pillars every meter or so, and a large yellowish-orange pipe, almost like a paper mache kite/rice paper lampshade - except it was large and ran into the house from the one side above the ceiling. The pillars were made with semi-circular pieces of wood stacked to make a pillar.

We came back to watch each pillar slowly fall and detach itself from the wall. Then there was a moment before the pipe slowly collapsed. It was horrible. And we did not know what to do.

I woke up again with the need to take charge of my and Lyn's affairs. Of sorting out the insurances, and her finances. She will need to submit. No, more autonomy for her.

> PostNote: I never did manage to take charge of our affairs. She refuses to submit to this. So, she gained more autonomy, less freedom, and more difficulties.
