# Climax

My desire is for a climax, an orgasm in the Willem Reich sense - an experience that is transporting - just like an hallucinogenic experience. One in which you experience bliss and are transported to another world, one of delight, and joy. It is transformative, and life-changing, and changes the world around us. When we sing "all you need is love", and say "God is Love", that is the experience of "being in Love" - the most incredible experience one can have - and it generally requires another.

# state of bliss:

Attainable when in love, (with the juice of the erotic manifest as/in sex). Only promised in spiritual/religious {spiritual - freedom to choose and practice as you will)/religious - daily practice according to a certain tradition). Acknowledged as a difficult goal, seldom achieved and even then, only partially - except by the very exceptional (Moses, Jesus, Buddha, the Prophet...) Yet many have experienced bliss (even if only once) in a love relationship.

What if that is the portal to the true path? What if that is the way to the integration of the masculine and the feminine. What if that is the True Tantra?

We awaken to consciousness in these bodies. Our first task is to take care of him or her. It provides us with sensations. Many sensations, and, as we begin to grow into this body, we, especially in the beginning, are bombarded by a plethora of new sensations. Some of them pleasurable, some painful. Some of them forgetful, some of them will be engraved into our lives. But the body never forgets. It is like a BI - body intelligence (just like AI or machine learning). It is always learning and adapting to what it is discovering in its environment.

Let me give an example. Place hand in flame. It burns. There is a sensation in your hand. You respond to that sensation - not the hand (as the recipient of the heat of the flame) - but your will, your mind, YOU react - again not your hand! On its own, it would continue to experience the sensation... and burn. In other words, your hand, without your mind, is not alive! However, your body is.

Alchemy: The spirit of the flame interacting with your spirit (spiritual entanglement is the experience of the immanence of the Divine {_Shekhina_})

# Chashmal

Electricity between two people.

# Male

Born with direction "sticking out" like an arrow pointing along a certain path - ala penis (though the penis is single minded - it only has one path). This is his "calling", and if he is virile, he will try and achieve it.
