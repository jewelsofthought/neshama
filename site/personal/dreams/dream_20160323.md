## Dream (2016-03-23)

Remember part where Hogsback house falls down. Had been having difficulties with people and the place. But it was a house made from stone and brick, with wooden circular pillars every meter or so, and a large yellowish-orange pipe, almost like a paper mache kite/rice paper lampshade - except it was large and ran into the house from the one side above the ceiling. The pillars were made with semi-circular pieces of wood stacked to make a pillar.

We came back to watch each pillar slowly fall and detach itself from the wall. Then there was a moment before the pipe slowly collapsed. It was horrible. And we did not know what to do.

I woke up again with the need to take charge of my and Lyn's affairs. Of sorting out the insurances, and her finances. She will need to submit. No, more autonomy for her.

> PostNote: I never did manage to take charge of our affairs. She refuses to submit to this. So, she gained more autonomy, less freedom, and more difficulties.
