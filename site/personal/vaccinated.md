   The vaccinated will need to support and protect the unvaccinated for the continued survival and evolution of the human race - as human!

The true nature and extent of this **volocaust** is beginning to descend upon us. Soon the effects of this experimental health therapy will begin to emerge, and the devastation it will have caused will become apparent. As a result, the unvaccinated will be targeted, and ostracised, just like the Jews were during the Second World War. This is to firstly create an external enemy of whom, you, the good people, the people who are doing the "right" thing, as told/ordered to by those in power.

The sad part of this is that the efficacy of a solution is seldom explored, resulting in a situation where the solution is more drastic than the problem. This (false) vaccination program is an example. To make matters worse, the stakes are so high that the perpetrators cannot admit making a mistake, and so they have no choice but to play this through, because any premature ending will result in many of these people's demise.

Either it plays out to the intended result of the perpetrators, or it will result in a different power structure, one in which they will not be the drivers of, instead, they will be the "victims" of this society.

To give it a name, we are in a battle against the trans-humanist agenda.

The trans-humanist agenda is an unGodly movement that believes that we can, nay, we must, "improve" on nature's grand design). It will create a human supermarket, commercialising our very genetic make-up. This is through constant gene-manipulation and tweaking for what will be believed to be the "best" result, once again, not taking into account any long-term changes - some of them irreversible. Children to order... though if we can live "forever", then who needs children? If your liver gets sick, just order another. This opens the door to some bizarre and twisted possibilities. The alcoholic can just replace his liver when the previous one fails. Where is the limit?

This will bring us to a place of proving whether a soul does exist or not, and whether this soul is eternal or not. For if the body can last forever, how long will the soul last? How deeply into its own darkness and pain can it descend? What will constitute entertainment for people who live 500 years?

If we have these types of core technology at our fingertips, I think, unless it is simple healing - the consequences of which we are not aware of yet - it should be something that is gifted under exceptional circumstances - not based on power... Can we do that?

The arrogance of the trans-humanist agenda is its deep (religious - for its religion is science) belief that all of creation is man's (and I emphasise _man_ to underline it's homo-erotic [as the love of man for men] in its character) nature) playground. That we are here to enjoy its (and not G-d's) fruits - until we unfortunately die. (A minor problem in the march of the terrifying gene manipulation technology - a highly profitable, but extremely dangerous, with many unknown consequences, one. What will be the effect of living 250 years on a person? How will we have enough data to know the answer to that question until enough people have lived their elongated lives - and then it will be too late to change any of it. You will be creating a new species (or sub-species). It is a social experiment. Only it is real and irreversible) But the true madness is the belief in our right, expressed by our ability (G-d given, for the religious; can-do, for the atheist), to manipulate the world and its beings for our own self-centred pleasures.

That even could be excused - but to pervert the very concept of being human, that is our birthright, and turn us into **virtual legal entities** (the People), removing our very humanity from the equation. Then "trade" our freedom back to us by offering us freedom to realise our desires, even our most perverted and selfish ones, as if that should be the goal and purpose of the freedoms they grant us. It is a form of consumerism - this freedom comes in very attractive packaging (beautiful women, beautiful music, beautiful beaches, beautiful homes...). This packaging is a fantasised (imaginary) version of the desire.

## Manufactured environment

If one is able, has the power/ability, to manufacture an environment that fits in the narrative that is being fed to us - we will have been boxed in. There is no where to hide...

The trans-humanist agenda is pro-religion, because that is what the very goal is of all spiritual & religious movements - to create an environment that is conducive to the uplifting of the person. Whereas the t-h agenda is one which is conducive to uplifting a tiny minority of people, and letting the rest starve.

Would you not like to live in a society that is good? Is it so wrong to believe in a world where men are good, and do not fight and kill and rape and pillage and prey on the weak and innocent?

## What guides the trans-humanist?

If a desire requires material to be fulfilled, in a finite world, there will always be the fear of not having enough &mdash; for it could. in reality, at any moment, vanish, dry-up, or/and run out.
How much deeper would be the fear, if this material prosperity is brought about through either nefarious methods, and/or through the manipulation of a virtual, manufactured system.

"Let them eat cake" - reminiscent of the societies in which people need to eat from the left-over food in trash cans. To turn this around as well, we think of that as such a terrible thing. But nature practices that everywhere - the waste of one is the food for another. That way there is less waste.

Perhaps a balanced society is one in which all levels of existence are taken into account - not denied, or excised. Let us work on dealing with the aberrent and abhorrent from that standpoint, rather than remaining in denial that human beings can act like such vile, cruel beasts.

I am not suggesting you love it. That is just the opposite of ignoring or denying it. I suggest we take responsibility for it, and deal with it as real. Recognise the symptoms early, and deal with it. Feed the encompassing being with whatever it needs to regain health - which, again, is not a defeating of the energy of the event, but of managing it. Thus the task of balance is to reduce it to a place that it can be managed, and no longer can cause harm.

## Branding

That is why communism worked. Offer the people what they desire... and I can control the people. [Branding](branding.html) is the capitalistic version of that. Convince people (through marketing and CR) that they need something that they don't really need - your product, hopefully, in the process, manufacturing addicts.

It was just a matter of time before the same technology would be used to manipulate electoral results. Where a party became a brand, and the candidate the latest "product".

## Lifestyle

Often these products are presented as part of a "[life-style](lifestyle.html)". {What a concept - "Style your life". Create your future. Be all you can be... design your life...}. The pepsi crowd, before it was called a "way of life", the way you decided to live. Now it is a style, like a hair-style. The gangster style, the happy-clappy style. The style becomes your life. You define yourself, and are defined, by the brands you carry - like medals or badges (we call them logos - and they appear on shirts, buildings, cards, everywhere.) Before it was mainly crosses and statues, and creative buildings.

Eventually, the same branding companies, begin to build environments in which this can all take place, and mechanisms that will entice or pressure the herd to eat of the products being fed to them. What choice do they have really?

## Choice - Environment

The cows would prefer munching happily in the fields. But when they are born in captivity, and spend their lives contained and fed by outside (conscious) influences, what choice do they have?

Similarly, someone born in a city has no choice but to eat the food available in the stores.

In an environment created by humans, the pathways will eventually become "cleaner" and cleaner, until all they will be made of, all that you will interact on along them, is human. It is like living in a house devoid of any living organism (besides yourself). In an environment directed by humans, it will end up the same plastic/virtual nightmare.

The finite cannot create the infinite. The possibilities will always be limited by the mind that created it. The possibilities we were granted in this life and in this world will only be restricted and constrained in human systems. We understand that, and accept that as necessary to survive and thrive. But if the purpose of our lives and these human creators is not an "infinite" one, then we will once again be shut into another mental prison.

## One of the Solution

Those who have travelled the spiritual/religious road say: If I find a spiritual source from which to nourish myself, or the spiritual source in the material, one is endlessly nourished &mdash; and no longer afraid. Perhaps this is all imaginary. But what world would you like to imagine?

One in which the endless ware between partial good and partial evil will continue endlessly? Or one in which good/kindness is the rule, and we all stand firm against the evil. Preparing for a world that is mostly good, interfacing and interacting with the evil in the constantly turning, waxing and waning, dynamics of this world. Remember the [Dao](dao.html)
