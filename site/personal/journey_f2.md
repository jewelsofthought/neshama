Normal roots. Use drums as your chariots, the mother keeping you rooted. We are in circle, and the circle is rooted, and it is strong. Bless the drummers, all of them. I ask that they hold us strongly, and that they are supported and guided by our ancestors, our guides, our angels and most of all, by the Holy Spirit, blessed is His Name.

This is an ascension journey. It is a journey to the heights and depths of this existence. To do that, bring your ascensions into your body. Find your position or your dance for now. Let go of everything. And I mean _everything_ &mdash; your feelings, your thoughts, desires, everything that makes up "you".

Breathe in. Breathe out.

Let's begin with a story. It is a story about two suns and a planet. A planet which is fertile. One of the suns says to the Creator: "You cannot have two lights in the sky." We know why, don't we? Perhaps it is because there would be no seasons; or too much extreme weather; or perhaps it is because there would be no night.

Whatever the reason, we now have a sun and a moon and the earth, the mother of where we live.

As she is bathed each day in sunlight, let us set our course and journey to the sun. Speak to this source of Divinely wrought light. Ask permission to approach. Listen, listen as you listen to the drums. The will guide you if you are in need of guidance. Feel its heat, its power and its light. Honour it. Bow to it. Dance it. Can you feel it inside of you? Reverberating with the energy of this most powerful entity?

Seek it, know where it is in you. Acknowledge it. Now speak to it. Ask it its name. Ask if it has a gift, or message for you. Feel your own response.

Then thank it, as you take leave of it, and ponder on where in your life you would like its energy to manifest.

Look at the glorious earth &mdash; mother to us all &mdash; and see how my light, my influence moves across her face, light her up, warming her, causing all the living beings to awaken. When the water, my spawn, falls from the heavens, everything begins to sprout, to be fruitful in the warmth and light that I bring. How I flow across the face of the earth, spreading my gifts to one and all, awakening with my light, the energy of life.

Move, once you are done. Move along these lines of light shining out onto the earth. Ride the light down to the land &mdash; this place, this time (eg: Shambala Institue, Scarborough/Red HIll, Afternoon on a Saturday) that is uniting at the...

**equinox**.

A time of change. The end of a solar period where the longest day shines forth in all its glory. Where we have risen to our highest and now we begin the journey back down into darker, colder times &mdash; the time of recuperation.

That happens later. For now, we sing and laugh and dance to the _equinox_. At this time, in this place and for this life.

Aho! For all my relations and all my community and all my brothers and sisters all over the world, speak of what is real for you. Speak your truth. **HaShem** will listen. _Adonai_ will hear.
