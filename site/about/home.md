- Guardians of the Tree of Life, having gorged from the Tree of Knowledge till it has led me to this place.

- Guardians of the living beings of the land and of being human.

- All the "things" that contain a living spirit&mdash;including those that might be &ndash; and are &ndash reflections of my own living spirit.
