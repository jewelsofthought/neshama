What meetings are possible in the angelic realm where actions are true?
Where a look accompanied by a tremor of excitement, can set a soul aflame.
That evening was full of surprises, clearing my projection,
My ego, special, non-sharing, shy of that part of me feeling exposed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;\* \* \*

Entering into the space of the Divine,
coming to terms with my nature.
Spreading my wings,
balancing my masculine, purposeful,
and my feminine, receptive,
while struggling with the desire for union.
To be free from the constraints
of the programming
of my past&mdash;the pull of my ancestors;
releasing the constrains and expressing
the light and love of my inner being.
For men, everything is experienced as other,
thus his strong need for union.
For women, aware of the union of everything,
knowing of no difference between herself and another,
constantly being battered on the rocks of the male's state of separateness.

The energy fused with the material
is the sexual realm of the upper world.
The "descent" of the spirit into manifest form
is the expression of the sexual in the spiritual space.
The orgasm is our primal portal to the spiritual.
Perhaps the feminine rises and the man descends.
Woman is filled, Man is emptied by the orgasm.
Woman's encounter is with the infinite fullness,
Man's is with the infinite emptiness.
The man encounters the Divine through
the emptiness of death;
the woman through the fullness of birth.
The mystery of death is that which provides
the fullness of life.
On the one hand death is the purveyor of all evil in this world,
the signifier of all impurity&mdash;
Yet only by overcoming death can we enter into the mystical realm.
A hero's journey, in which we have to pass through the valley of death,
and emerge, with faith alone, and G!d at your side, into life.
Only by encountering the energy of death,
and overcoming it by choosing life,
by discovering what means more to you than death.

"What is that?"

I thought it was love.
But I have too many ashes now to all
that has been sacrificed on the altar of love.
I thought it was G!d.
But I am tired of calling into the cold night
as I struggle through my own blind darknesses.
Yet in the depth of the darkness, You respond to me.

I believe, i Believe.
