What meetings are possible in the angelic realm where actions are true?
Where a look accompanied by a tremor of excitement, can set a soul aflame.
That evening was full of surprises, clearing my projection,
My ego, special, non-sharing, shy of that part of me, feeling exposed.

Imagine what meetings are possible in the angelic realm where actions are true
where a look accompanied by a tremor of excitement, can set a soul aflame.
That evening was full of surprises, clearing my projection,
My ego, special, non-sharing, shy of that part of me, feeling exposed.

In order to entering the space of the Divine
you need to come to terms with your nature.
Spread your wings, balancing your purposeful energy
with the desire to receive,
while struggling with the need for union.
To be free from the constraints
of the programming
of the past&mdash;the pull of ancestors;
releasing the constrains and expressing
the light and love of my inner being.
For us, everything is experienced as other,
thus our strong need for union.
For them, aware of the union of everything,
knowing of no difference between themselves and another,
constantly being battered on the rocks of our state of separateness.

The energy fused with the material
is the sexual realm of the upper world.
The "descent" of the spirit into manifest form
is the expression of the union in the spiritual space.
The orgasm is our primal portal to the spiritual.
Perhaps the other rises above their chaos,
as we descend into our darkness alone.
She is filled, he is emptied.
Her encounter is with the infinite fullness,
His is with the infinite emptiness.
One encounters the Divine through
the emptiness of death;
the other through the fulfilment of life.
The mystery of death is that which provides
fullness to life.
On the one hand death is the purveyor of all evil in this world,
the signifier of all impurity&mdash;
Yet only by overcoming death can we enter into the mystical realm,
A hero's journey, in which we have to pass through the valley of death,
and emerge, with faith alone, the Witness at your side, into life.
For only by encountering the energy of death,
and choosing life,
by discovering what means more to you than death.

"What is that?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;\* \* \*

I thought it was love.
But I have too many ashes now to all
that has been sacrificed on the altar of love.
I thought it was G!d.
But I am tired of calling into the cold night
as I struggle through my own blind darknesses.

Yet in the midst of the dark emptiness of my being,
You respond to me,
as I cry out: "I believe, i Believe."
