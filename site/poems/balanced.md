<div class="poem">

In the mistiness 
of my quietness,
From the depths 
of my stillness,
A feather drifts 
slowly to earth.
Holding my breath,
I feel subtle joy 
surrounding me.
Calmer than ever, 
I sit
Precariously balanced
Between something

& 
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3rem; margin-left: 2rem; font-size: 50%">
nothing.
</p>
