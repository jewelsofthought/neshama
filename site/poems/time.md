<div class="poem">

To be caught in a moment,
is to be enslaved in time.
That is the box I need to escape.
Driving here, I had the whole day.
So I took the byways,
and the journey took hours
instead of two.

Slowly, slowly,
I relaxed, until finally
I was deep in a driving meditation.
Time steals experiences from one.
We are surrounded by numbers,
Everything
Needs to be quantified,
everything
is to be accounted for. . .

even time itself.
