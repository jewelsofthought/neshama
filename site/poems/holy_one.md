```
The Holy One
  Blessed is His Name,
    May His Glory
      Shine upon us
        Forever and Forever.
Let the soft waters
  Of Your Love
    Sustain &
      Purify me.
Till I can walk forever in Your Presence.
Teach me.
Guide me.
Lead me back,
  But do NOT abandon me.
For I am weak &
  Easily wander off
    The path of
      Righteousness,
The way that leads
  to You.
The ascent that will
  Bring me into your throne room.
Once there I supplicate myself,
Bowing to your
Glory and Majesty.
```
