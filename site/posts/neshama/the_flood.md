## The Flood (Judaica)

- Not everyone drowned in the flood
  There were pockets of humanity all over the world that survived.
- All the stories of the flood are perhaps mythologised stories based on some actual event.
- As perhaps the stories of escaping the flood, often via an Ark-like vessel, or some other sort of "other-worldly" means might have been history tales, retold many times, of the same event.
- We find similar themes, such as the infant child, surviving miraculously, growing up to become a saviour to his people.

It is a story expressing the wisdom that the energy that will set us free will always travel along a path that is different from the "normal/regular/accepted" path. If it affects the center, it will change everything. If contained, it will only change the outside - else it will instigate painful and disturbing changes, some good, some bad - that might result in an actual intrinsic change in the society itself - with G-d's blessing.

> The flood was an Electro-Magnetic (EM) event.

Steven King wrote a book about a signal that was sent out on our the cell phones that turned people into vicious zombies. One could send out pulses of certain EM frequencies that would impact the person's nervous system, or their regulatory systems, their immune system, or even their cognition&mdash;perhaps any "system". If one could introduce magnetised (or magnetisable) elements into the body, it should make it that much simpler to manipulate or even terminate them. I am just painting a possible scenario of an EM event.

One of the clues here is that in biblical tales, water has often been a metaphor for elements that express themselves as waves, as in "The Spirit of the Lord was over the waters". These unseen forces (as in the EM spectrum) are represented in the modern world as waves as well. These "waves" are not any more real now that we can express them mathematically.

In the early times, light, when represented by waves, were thought to be propogated in a medium called the luminous ether, just as the waves of the ocean need the medium of water to propogate.

## EM-sensitive (Neshama)

What if it were possible for certain human beings, under certain conditions, to become cognitively aware of the electromagnetic (and possibly other) waves around us?

Shamans we called them. In my tradition, we refer to them as prophets. But they go by many names, mystic, visionary, messiah, clairvoyant, seer, magician, witch, psychic, hallucination, and then a whole cornucopia of demons, angels, devils, imps, fairies, poltergeists, ghosts, spirits.... All of these people and what they represented is today believed to be purely of our imagination - thus thought of as mental creations, because they cannot not (or are not) proven scientifically.

However, the way that we know of the existence of the unseen EM waves today is through their effect. We build instruments which use that energy, and thus we believe that energy to be real - not knowing anything about them.

Why was it different when there was spiritual/unseen/mysterious energies that affected humans and their environment, that are know no longer accessed. What if we spent the same amount of time and energy in researching the existence of these energies? Just as we spend billions on building massive systems that are said to be able to sense and measure then unknown and often unbelievable sub-atomic elements. Why, if we build a machine that says that something exists do we believe it, yet if someone senses the existence of something that we cannot build a machine to measure, we will not believe that it exists?

Once again, we find ourselves being asked to believe in material measurements above and beyond those measurements that we encounter from the G-d made machines - human and otherwise.

In addition, if the machines can sense this energy, how can we claim that they cannot be sensed by living beings. We radiate our environment with these waves and energies that power so much of our material lives, and yet continously deny any claims that they might affect living systems.

We bathe an area in radio waves. The bees dissappear, and we deny any connection - seeking some chemical or more elemental cause of their demise. People are suffering all sorts of strange illnesses, some of which were exceedingly rare before electrification, and we deny that electricity might have any effect on their health?

Whom are the ones that benefit from this denial, while the sickness and discomfort spreads? But those who are the proponents and manufacturers of said devices.
