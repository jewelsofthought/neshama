## Hero’s Journey

Our journey begin on the inside, awakening to consciousness, slowly gaining awareness the world around us. As time goes by, we reach a level of cognition from and of our environment, and its topology. Our journey actually begins at this stage, and it might take many years, but the portal is an awareness of the other AND the effect we are having on the world around us. The end of the journey is of-course unattainable – and this is to be fully conscious of our world, both inner and outer, and the effect we have upon it. Then begins the hero’s journey into the inner reaches of your own self – what we call the soul, the _Nefesh_ - that which I am in the world around me. But that is not the cause, not the first cause, and you begin to understand that as you head deeper into the reaches of your being. where you encounter forgiveness and responsibility. Nevertheless, most certainly, you need to take full responsibility for your relationship with the “inevitable” events of your life. Those that seem to be part of your destiny. And believe me they are! For each one of us has a purpose, some big, some “small”, but just as it takes a village to make a village, so it will take the entire human population to fashion a global community. As you are responsible for what is happening in your life, you also need to be responsible about what has happened in your life. You need to forgive yourself for what you have done that was not true to your inner purpose and will – as in _“Thy will be done, in heaven as on earth”_.

Then, perhaps, you will be allowed into the next room in the holy mansion, A place of wind, and constant movement. Where nothing is clear, but is in continuous journey from the upper to the lower. All forms are questioned, all thoughts are entertained, all the time holding the rod of constraint to maintain the dynamic balance necessary for life. This is the place of the higher soul or spirit – _Ruach_. It is the place of the angels and emotions, the invisible energies that flit back and forth, espressing the willfulness of the the living energies of the Divine and the mundane. If you can find the quiet in which the golden thread can be seen, then it will lead you to the next room in your mansion, the _Neshamah_, where the calm breath that settles like a mist on the dust, causing everything to bloom, floats. Out of the mist, one can glimpse a light, brilliant and pulsating from which the Force de Majeur descends. If blessed, you may encounter the breath (voice?) of the Divine, the all-powerful King of the Universe. It is then that you begin to experience awe and deep understanding of how it is all connected and full of spirit. Finally, you may be gifted with a glimpse of the Holy of Holiest, until you have realised that we are all part of a purpose that is so beyond purpose that it leaves you breathless.

## The Template

What we need to understand, truly understand, is that there is a template within which each one of us is born. It is commonly called your body.[^6] It is the skin, the barrier, that divides the inside from the outside. The place where we live is inside this “external” template.[^7]

Why do I say that there is a template? Generally, each one of us has, within certain extremes, the same physical template – differing only in some details, like colour of hair, eye-shape, size, height, etc. There are only very occasionally aberrant outbursts, but nothing truly untoward. For instance, our knees cannot bend backward, nor do we have a hand on our stomachs. Each one of us is formed from the same template, perhaps one can think of it as the same idea.

This is repeated, perhaps infinitely, out and in, above and below, large and small. Each atom is made from a template, which is quite well described nowadays. The galaxies are formed in similar ways, and gravity is gravity, however you interact with it. And we, and all of life, in fact, all of creation, exist within the constraints of this template. That we cannot change. But we can be whatever we wish within the possibilities inherent in this template. That is the place of consciousness.

We eat to feed the body, yet this food cannot feed the soul. It is our relationship with the food that will nourish the soul. Our “affinity” to it. Thus it is with everything that we interact act with. If we have a “soul-full” relationship with it, then it can satisfy the needs of our soul. If not, then it is available to feed {[something else](sitra_achara.html)} – like the plastic wrapper, which you trash and throw on the ground. Where it goes we can speak of at another time.

## ToLNet

Now I want to speak about creating [the template](/posts/neshama/journey/index.html#the-template) of the relationships that connect these heart spaces from which these seeds will come.

The way we step into the physical reality that we exist in, is by commitment. For commitments define the lines upon which our structures are founded. Commitments used to be made with the spoken word. In the days when all a man had was his reputation which relied on his words – as much as his actions, we called it oaths and vows. In fact creation begins with words “And he said... let there be light.”

Once we have commitment, [the framework](/posts/tol/communities/) can be built, which we have named “The Tree of Life Network. The covenant we are asked to accept is one of life – to nourish, protect, sustain all life. The commitment that you make is to the task of building a peaceful global community, in which the majority of its population are living safely.

The first task we need to perform is the calling. This is to make a connection with others who share our world view - one in which we believe that every relationship is sacred.

A spiritual flame shows people how to act in a way that is more aligned with their experience of the Sacred.8

Perhaps the quintessential element in this time that needs repairing is our relationship with our Mother Earth – though not the only factor – however, let us start there. That will bring us to the beginning &mdash; our food. That which the Mother offers us and provides us, as long as we honour her – as is said in the litany: “If you will follow My commandments, you will have rain in the season, and your crops will grow, and your trees will bear fruit.” As long as the flame burns, so it provide nourishment to the body and the spirit of the people.

The journey starts from first principles. That first principle says that we are made both of body and of spirit. It is an acknowledgement of Spirit. Once we acknowledge that, we can then begin to investigate the Sciences of the Sacred. I am blessed to be the recipient of this Wisdom of our Ancestors.
Building

Begin to build these communities, communities of communities. Call them sacred communities, or support groups, companies or whatever else you wish. I would like to call them “Communities of Truth”. These communities are made up of affinity groups. Small groups of people who are willing to make a commitment to one another.

Start with a small commitment. To help out at a shelter, or to fix a shed, cook a meal for a sick person... If you can rely on a person’s word, you will begin to trust them.

Think of it like starting a business, or a company.
