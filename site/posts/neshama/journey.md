## Hero's Journey

Our journey begin on the inside, awakening to a greater consciousness of the world around us. As time goes by, we will reach a level of cognition from and of our environment, and its topology, that will enable to awaken to a greater awareness of the reality of our existence. Our journey actually begins at this stage, and it might take many years, but the portal is an awareness of the other AND the effect we are having on the other around us. The end of the journey is of-course unattainable – and this is to be fully conscious of our world, both inner and outer, and the effect we have upon it. So begins the hero's journey into the inner reaches of your own self – what we call the soul, the _Nefesh_ - that which I am in the world around me. The first step is to realise that I am  not the cause, not the first cause. You will begin to understand that as you head deeper into the reaches of your being, to seek forgiveness and accept the  responsibility of who you are. Most certainly, you need to take full responsibility for your relationship with the "inevitable" events of your life. Those that seem to be part of your destiny. And believe me they are! For each one of us has a purpose, some big, some "small", but just as it takes a community to make a village, so it will take the entire human population to fashion a global community. As you are responsible for what is happening in your life, you also need to be responsible about what has happened in your life. You need to forgive yourself for what you have done that was not true to your inner purpose and will – as in _"Thy will be done, in heaven as on earth"_.

Then, perhaps, you will be allowed into the inner court of the holy mansion, A place of wind, and constant movement. Where nothing is clear, but is in continuous journey from the upper to the lower. All forms are questioned, all thoughts are entertained, all the time holding the rod of constraint to maintain the dynamic balance necessary for life and death. This is the place of the higher soul or spirit – _Ruach_. It is the place of the angels and emotions, the invisible energies that flit back and forth, espressing the will of the the living emanations of the Divine through the mundane. If you can find the quiet in which the golden thread can be seen, then it will lead you to the sanctuary in your holy mansion, the _Neshamah_, where the calm breath that settles like a mist on the dry soil, causing everything to bloom, floats. Out of the mist, one can glimpse a light, brilliant and pulsating from which the Force de Majeur descends. If blessed, you may encounter the breath of the Divine, the all-powerful King of the Universe. It is then that you begin to tremble with awe at the  understanding of how it is all deeply connected and full of spirit. Finally, you may be gifted with a glimpse of the Holy of Holiest, until you have realised that we are all part of a purpose that is so beyond purpose that it leaves you breathless.

## The Template

What we need to understand, truly understand, is that there is a template within which each one of us is born. It is commonly called your body. It is the skin, the barrier, that divides the inside from the outside. The place where we live is inside this "external" template.

Why do I say that there is a template? Generally, each one of us has, within certain extremes, the same physical template – differing only in some details, like colour of hair, eye-shape, size, height, etc. There are only very occasionally aberrant outbursts, but nothing truly untoward. For instance, most of our knees cannot bend backward, but none of us have a hand on our stomachs. Each one of us is formed from the same template, perhaps one can think of it as the same idea.

This is repeated, perhaps infinitely, out and in, above and below, large and small. Each atom is made from a template, which is quite well described nowadays. The galaxies are formed in similar ways, and gravity is gravity, however you interact with it. And we, and all of life, in fact, all of creation, exist within the constraints of this template. That we cannot change. But we can be whatever we wish within the possibilities inherent in this template. That is the place of choice between probable destinies.

We eat to feed the body, an almost magical process by which dead matter is turned into nourishment for our bodies &mdash; yet this food cannot feed the soul, unless there was something of the same material (or that could be transformed into said material) in the "dead matter". Somehow (another magical process), it is our relationship with the food that will nourish the soul. Our "affinity" to it. Thus it is with everything that we interact with. If we have a "soul-full" relationship with it, then it can satisfy the needs of our soul. If not, then it will feed {[something else](sitra_achara.html)} – like the plastic wrapper, which you trash and throw on the ground. Where it goes we can speak of at another time.
