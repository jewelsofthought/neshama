## As above so below

        One can seek the material in the material, or the spiritual in the material.

We awaken into a material world, a world of "real" things - which we refer to as "reality". We need these material things to exist, and the natural goal is to accumulate enough material to sustain oneself. However, when one has ensured one's basic material security, what is one's subsequent drive? This is where we have the choice whether to take the high road, or the low road. The lower would be to seek more material, and the higher would be to seek the spiritual hidden in the material - the message, rather than the messenger!

## Sexual

The intention must be pure (תהור). ֺOne has to rise above the material which inspires the sexual. If that becomes the raison d'etre of your connection, it will quickly become enmeshed/awash with it.

## Relationship

When two people's energies touch, it is similar to a what is known as a _quantum flirt_ - "a short-lived, transient, perceptual signal which can be used to provide us with insight."
