## Mekubalim Lectures:

Anonymous speaker:

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, I am honoured and proud to bring you the first publically broadcast talk of one of the shepherds of our way.

Because of the current state of affairs, and the danger of speaking out against the present narrative, we remain completely anonymous. The consequences of posing a threat to any of the current power structures are well documented.

So I bring to you, Rav Y'mba.

"To all of you out there, we are at war. It is a war of humanity against all that is inhuman. We will not allow the state or any of its representatives, nor of any system or ideal, to destroy the very essence of what it means to be human.

We stand against the fiction of legal personhood. Either it concerns a human being, or it doesn't. Either it is human and humane or it is not. Either it affirms life (and not _just_ human life, but all life), or it an agent of dis-ease and death.

It is not that we are deluded. Of course disease and death and suffering are a part of life, of the experience of being human. It is just the constant unashamed twisting of truth, and constant bag of meaningless promises, while all the time pursuing an agenda of divine immortality, rather than accepting that of Divinity. The empty promises to gain our trust and confidence, and then, once gaining the administrative and legal power, using it to further their own agenda. In other words, this position is just a necessary step in their plan, a plan (to [succeed](success.html) ).

```
Success:
{
  define success. universal, communal, personal? How limited/selfish & how unselfish. How much for the good of the community, how much just for the family? Is there a universal def. of success? One that would be accepted across all races, religions and cultures?
}
```

Immortal:
{
Immortal means to live (as human) forever. It is interesting that that is the characteristic associated with all gods that is the most meaningful to a certain segment of the population. Others focus on the characteristic of love, others of mercy, others on judgement. The next stage would be to be less two dimensional, holding the two as does Lady Justice, with the sword and the scales. How unbalanced...

Divinity means to finally progress to the something different, hopefully ascend to the next stage... or not.
It is that 'or not' that many are afraid of. Especially those who have ignored the messages, and have continued to pursue an agenda, knowingly or not, that is limited in scope. Like the titanic, only a small portion of those sufficiently worthy will survive.
}

```

We have uploaded this video through an anonymous distributed blockchain, from a number of sites simultaneously. Even that poses a danger to those sites. I hope they will not be penalised, as they had no active part in it, nor were they aware of what was transpiring under their very noses. So please forgive them.

Our communications are run on a dynamic, extremely fluid and responsive network that is completely private and, so far, secure. It is also essentially anonymous and everyones data is owned by the person, and no-one and nothing, has access to any of it without his permission. [#transactions](transactions.html){All transactional information is private. Well-defined (and agreed upon) private and public domain. All of these agreements have both a fixed and a fluid aspect to them}
```

However, to foster a culture of lying, concealing the truth, stealing, intimidation, assault and even murder of innocents - over and over again. We are being treated like cattle. There are examples of people being transported in cattle cars too. We can respond and behave like cattle &mdash; but, being human, and not cattle &mdash; we can choose a different path. Even as cattle, they will be hard pressed to change our direction, once we decide.

My message at this time is: Become as self-sufficient as you can. Convince your family and friends to also at least think about it.
Hook up with those in your community, and build networks and support structures.

We will find you... Good luck.

## Economy

It may not be bad, but the world economy is shrinking and reconfiguring itself at the same time. How far it will go, how deep will be the changes, only time will tell. But, being prepared for the worst case scenario, anything else will be easy.

This raises the uneasy question of [arms](arms.html), especially [guns](guns.html).

```
Arms
{
  Guns are a tool, but they are killers. To invite a killer into your home needs careful consideration. It also makes a potential killer of you! Remember that.

Thus I say: Those who are trained, and willing to undergo the appropriate discipline, will be allowed to handle guns. The underlying principle here is that guns are dangerous, but in the hands of untrained and unqualified people, they are deadly and can easily tip the balance of power, if allowed to spread unchecked.
}
