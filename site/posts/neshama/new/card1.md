## Centre (Neshama)

      The centre is a position relative to the space of the containment.

And to some extent the rules and mechanics of measurement.

## The truth (Neshama)

      Yes. It is true. The truth will set you free --
      to do good,
      or to do evil!

## Your Gift (Neshama)

      During the building phase, your gift is your tool. If it becomes a sword, then, if you live by the sword, you will die by the sword.

## Your Eldership (Neshama)

      Your eldership is obtained/ordained/recognised when you gain the wisdom of the gift. Which means "I have been granted my share" i.e. "I have been gifted with...".

## Victory (ToL)

      The only way to fight an organised enemy is with stealth - organised as a loosely coupled web of tight units.

## Power (ToL)

Power is upheld by a belief in the system which grants certain people authority and power&mdash;bolstered by a (misplaced) faith in a human created system, rather than relying on and learning from the Divinely created system.

There is also the unfortunate and very real threat of those in power taking (by whatever means possible) ever greater power, until they reach they ultimate reach the peak of absolute power&mdash;or die trying.

No human system is [perfect](incompleteness.html){Godel}. Even if the system in which this human system is embedded&mdash;call it the "universe"&mdash;is perfect and balanced. How would we, contained in the embedded system ever be able to say anything about the universe in which we are enclosed &mdash; let alone whether it is "perfect" and "balanced" or not?

However, let that be, it is certain that whatever system we create, nay even imagine, is, and can only be, an approximation, a facsimile of the encompassing universe.

Therefore, this power is claimed, by force or by fancy, and upheld through a social doctrine that has enough claimants to uphold and serve it. These zealouts are clustered around those who have succeeded by and through this social doctrine, and whom, by propagating and upholding it have benefitted from it in some way. Or perhaps just believing in it because it is easier than going against the current narrative... "Just going with the flow".

Combined with the techniques of branding, backed by careful data analysis, this could result in a serious abuse of power, having global repercussions.

## Torah Laws (Judaica)

The details of the Torah Laws, perhaps including the Oral Torah, which had been given at Sinai were then obeyed by the generation that wandered in Sinai. Why and how could they obey them, if there, for instance, was no Temple? How could they keep the Laws of Kashrut if they were receiving manna from heaven, that would be by its very nature, be kosher? They had no need for work, as they had food and their clothes needed no mending. I wonder if their tents and other materials did need maintenance or not?

In a sense the laws were given to a generation who were unable to practice them!

What did the livestock eat during these wanderings in the desert? They were not able to grow, nor harvest grains. Nor did they have need for them - except as animal food. Also the livestock must have increased significantly if no-one was eating the meat. And why would the people not eat some of their livestock, at least, if there were getting bored of eating the magical manna?

During that period, they must have lost a significant amount of useful skills, as besides having no need of them, they would not have time to set up shop, and teach their children any of their skills. So the bricklayers, potmakers, leatherworkers and blacksmiths... all were gone! Even if they had had those skills, they must have lost many of them being labourers to the Pharoahs. Thus the generation that entered would know little of such arts. If you think this is unlikely. That knowledge of that nature is not lost in a generation, just look at our children. Children that no longer read books, or know how to do arithmetic, etc. Within one generation think of the skills that have been lost, especially in the move from one technology to another. Try and find a skilled mason today. If we ever need to use horse and cart for our main source of transport, we will be in serious trouble, as there are not enough people who know who to make the leather bridles and saddles, etc that will be needed.

## The Flood (Judaica)

- Not everyone drowned in the flood
  There were pockets of humanity all over the world that survived.
- All the stories of the flood are perhaps mythologised stories based on some actual event.
- As perhaps the stories of escaping the flood, often via an Ark-like vessel, or some other sort of "other-worldly" means might have been history tales, retold many times, of the same event.
- We find similar themes, such as the infant child, surviving miraculously, grows to become a saviour to his people.

It is a story expressing the wisdom that the energy that will set us free will always travel along a path that is different from the "normal/regular/accepted" path. If it affects the center, it will change everything. If contained, it will only change the outside - else it will instigate painful and disturbing changes, some good, some bad - that might result in an actual intrinsic change in the society itself - with G-d's blessing.

## EM-event (Judaica:Tol)

      The flood was an EM-event.

Steven King wrote a book about a signal that was sent out on our the cell phones that turned people into vicious zombies. One could send out pulses of certain EM frequencies that would impact the person's nervous system, or their regulatory systems, their immune system, or even their congition&mdash;perhaps any "system". If one could introduce magnetised (or magnetisable) elements into the body, it should make it that much simpler to manipulate or even terminate them. I am just painting a possible scenario of an EM event. Water has always signified the elements that express themselves as waves, as in "The Spirit of the Lord was over the waters".

## EM-sensitive (Neshama)

What if it were possible for certain human beings, under certain conditions, to become cognitively aware of the electromagnetic (and possibly other) waves around us?

Shamans we called them. In my tradition, we refer to them as prophets. But they go by many names, mystic, visionary, messiah, clairvoyant, seer, magician, witch, psychic, hallucination, and then a whole cornucopia of demons, angels, devils, imps, fairies, poltergeists, ghosts, spirits.... And all of that is purely our imagination - thus our mental creations?

## Spiritual Gym (Neshama)

A spiritual gym is a place where you

- lift weights/concepts heavier than regularly
- carry a concept further than usual
- refine your techniques

## Spiritual Lab (Neshama)

A spiritual laboratory is where you carry out carefully crafted experiments to see what responds.

A Kung-fu master said

> Many teach you about external movements, how to deal with outside forces. But it is the inner shape that is most important. Here we shape the inner. We focus on the internal shape of things. But what occurs on the outside is of prime importance.

As the eyes and the ears, the nose and mouth, the heart, legs and arms of G-d having a human experience - this is where you could begin to embrace and embody the truth of your existence.
