## Centre

      The centre is a position relative to the space of the containment.

And to some extent the rules and mechanics of measurement.

## The truth

      Yes. It is true. The truth will set you free &mdash;
      to do good,
      or to do evil!

## Your Gift

      During the building phase, your gift is your tool. If it becomes a sword, then, if you live by the sword, you will die by the sword.

## Your Eldership

      Your eldership is obtained/ordained/recognised when you gain the wisdom of the gift. Which means "I have been granted my share" i.e. "I have been gifted with...".

## Victory

      The only way to fight an organised enemy is with stealth - organised as a loosely coupled web of tight units.

## Power

Power is upheld by a belief in the system which grants certain people authority and power -&mdash; bolstered by a (misplaced) faith in a human created system, rather than relying on and learning from the Divinely created system.

There is also the unfortunate and very real threat of those in power taking (by whatever means possible) ever greater power, until they reach they ultimate reach the peak of absolute power &mdash; or die trying.

No human system is [perfect](incompleteness.html){Godel} - even if the system in which this human system is embedded &mdash; call it the "universe" &mdash; is perfect and balanced. How would we, contained in the embedded system ever be able to say anything about the universe in which we are enclosed &mdash; let alone whether it is "perfect" and "balanced" or not.

However, let that be, it is certain that whatever system we create, nay even imagine, is, and can only be, an approximation, a facsimile of the encompassing universe, let alone the system in which we are embedded.

Therefore, this power is claimed, by force or by fancy, and upheld through a social doctrine that has enough claimants to uphold and serve it. These zealouts are clustered around those who have succeeded by and through this social doctrine propagating and upholding it having benefitted from it is some way &mdash; or just believing in it because it is easier than going against the current narrative... "Just going with the flow".

Combined with the techniques of branding, backed by careful data analysis, this could result in a serious abuse of power, having global repercussions.

## The Flood

- Not everyone drowned in the flood
  There were pockets of humanity all over the world that survived.
- All the stories of the flood are perhaps mythologised stories based on some actual event.
- As perhaps the stories of escaping the flood, often via an Ark-like vessel, or some other sort of "other-worldly" means might have been history tales, retold many times, of the same event.
- We find similar themes, such as the infant child, surviving miraculously, grows to become a saviour to his people.
  It is a story expressing the wisdom of the truth that the energy that will set us free will always travel along a path that is different from the "normal/regular/accepted" path. If it affects the center, it will change everything. If contained, it will only change the outside - else it will instigate painful and disturbing changes, some good, some bad - that might result in an actual intrinsic change in the society itself - with G-d's blessing.

## EM-event

      The flood was an EM-event.

What if it were possible for certain human beings, under certain conditions to become aware of the electromagnetic (and possibly other) waves around us?

Shamans we called them. In my tradition, we refer to them as prophets. But they go by many names, mystic, visionary, messiah, clairvoyant, seer, magician, witch, psychic, hallucination, and then a whole cornucopia of demons, angels, devils, imps, fairies, poltergeists, ghosts, spirits.... And all of that is purely our imagination - thus our mental creations?
