## Truth

The only way to rebuild our societies' structures will be to have their foundation, their {[axis mundi](axis_mundi.html)}, built upon Truth.

Not the static truth of Kings and Idolatry, but the dynamic, living Truth of the One. Not the kind of truth that requires information to be classified.

If the protocol of a society is in tune with the Truth of Existence, the Oneness of the Living Presence&mdash;a protocol which acknowledges the difference between good and evil, and responds appropriately&mdash;we may find the road to fulfilment.

To build the Truth into our foundation, means to acknowledge firstly our dependence on the Awesome Presence of the Divine in Everything. Then, acknowledging our human limitations, to fashion systems that respond to the all aspects of the human being, not just those that we want or like, but relating also the dark and challenging aspects of our natures, and that of the nature that surrounds us.

The only way to root this idea in the world is through prayer, meditation, clear thinking, using the Truth as the chisel with which we engrave the stones of our lives.

## What is Truth?

"What is this Truth that you speak of? You talk of it as if it is some sort of absolute truth. We all know that truth is relative, especially in a fluid universe. Tell us of this Truth."

"This Truth that I speak of is also not static, yet it holds a position relative to the object/event that is under observation. It is measured by its distance from what is **really** happening&mdash;something we can never be fully aware of.[^1]

The Truth of an event is the event itself. Thus it cannot be discussed in relation to its truth or falsity, for it is simply the event. However, the only truth we can know, is the "truth" that we can comprehend&mdash;which is essentially the truth that fits into our current narrative of being&mdash;which can only emerge subsequent to the event itself. That will become the created "reality" of the occurrence, fed by our perceptions, recorded according to our mores. It is only after the event has actually occurred, that it enters the imaginarium of our minds. That is where we begin to shape what had just occurred. As time passes, that memory, also fluid, is influenced by the factors that arise subsequently. As it morphs, and becomes more embedded, taking up residence in our imaginariums, it now becomes the absolute truth - as far as he or she is concerned, and there is little that will dissuade said person.

Judging outcomes, Truth will always triumph&mdash;for it is the foundation of all occurrences, as the expression of the actual forces that brought about the event. Although slow, each one of Truth's steps are true. Whereas lies flit around like a butterfly on cocaine, always seeking acknowledgement, but never finding a place to rest, for it has to constantly maintain the lie(s). If it ceases feeding it for one moment, it will begin to die, for it is the product of the finite mind, and thus lives and dies by the hand(s) that formed it. Its source is not true, and is itself a lie (or liar), and the truth is its nemesis, that it will need to battle with all its might. The most successful of lies will place truth, its enemy, amongst its lies, to its advantage. Thus, it is of utmost importance, is to be taught the Truth, so as to be able to discern between truth and lies.

Yet how can one do that if surrounded by people whose lives are based upon a lie? One's parents lie, one's teachers and leaders lie. Where is truth hiding?

Brothers, and sisters, friend and foe, know that truth never hides. "He" hides in plain sight". For the event is the event, and the truth of the event stands as straight and firm as the shortest line between any two points. Everything else is an approximation, and the closest approximation, the truest rendition of the event itself, will, in truth, always triumph.

Unless those lies are more convenient, more important to the recipients of the story.

Lies play by their own rules&mdash;which one should always except from a low-life like that. It is the name of his game. Yet even the truthsayers need him, for how else can their be truthsayes if there are no liars?

Remember this simple truth: lies cannot hide the truth. They can only blind us to the truth. Like an illusionist, they seduce us to look at what is being presented&mdash;not what is really going on behind their lies.

[^1]: **Measurement**: Any perception of the event is only partial. This is because we firstly only see a small segment of the totality of any event, and secondly, because we can only perceive & comprehend an event after it has occurred and if we have the appropriate means of perceiving the change so as to be able to measure said event.
