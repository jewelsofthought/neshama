<p>When a person feels desire towards something, he can then make contact with its core – the divine desire to be. But only if he experiences divine pleasure in its being,<a href="#_end1" name="_top1"><sup style="color: lightgreen" style="color: lightgreen">[1]</sup></a> will he achieve the true fulfillmint of his desire, to touch its soul. However, the degree and intensity of this pleasure is governed by the object of desire’s place in the chain. The more spiritual the thing that is desired is, the more fulfilling will be the pleasure it yields – for it is closer to the source of all pleasure.<a href="#_end2" name="_top2"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[2]</sup></a> The ultimate experience of pleasure lies in the experience of union with the Source, where pleasure resides in its most pristine form.<a name="_top3" href="#_end3"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[3]</sup></a></p>

	<h4><i>Pleasure as Displeasure</i></h4>
	
	
	<p>In its lowest reaches, the Chain of Evolution yields things that are
	inconducive<a name="_top4" href="#_end4"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[4]</sup></a> – or even contrary – to what G-d desires.<a name="_top5" href="#_end5"><sup style="color: lightgreen, font-weight:">[5]</sup></a>
	</p>
	
	<p><a name="_top6" href="#_end6"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[6]</sup></a>The capacity of these things to give pleasure is an existential paradox.
	All pleasure is but the embodiment of the divine pleasure in creation, while these pleasures are divine <u><b>dis</b></u>>pleasures – things contrary to creation>.<a name="_top7" href="#_end7"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[7]</sup></a> Yet they, too, are products of the divine desire, since their capacity to give pleasure fills a certain function in G-d’s purpose in creation: G-d desired that we be confronted with a choice between
	good and evil (so that our deeds should be meaningful and significant). But G-d wants that these things should exist only in order that man should reject them as contrary to His very existence; so theirs is an existence whose inner essence – those function and raison d’ētre – is not to exist.</p>
	
	<p>Let's use the metaphor of digestion to explain the phenomenon.</p>
	
	<p>Digestion is the process by which food passes through the various organs which break it down and separate its finer elements from its coarser ones. At each phase of the process, this separation grows more and more defined; ultimately,
	the finer elements in the food evolve into body-building cells and energy, and its coarser elements are ejected by the body. Both the nutrients and the waste are products of the digestion system; but the former is generated to be used, while the latter is generated to be rejected and therby enable the body’s absorption of the former.</p>
	
	<p>By the same token, the Chain of Evolution is like the cosmic “digestive
	system” in which the essence of creation is processed into the substance and the energy of the universe that G-d desired. This process (like every process we know) also generates waste – elements that must be separated and disposed of in order for the desirable product to function.<a name="_top8anc" href="#_end8"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[8]</sup></a></p>
	
	<p>Of course, G-d could have evolved His world in such a manner that the good develops without any separation of waste, or, for that matter, He could have not evolved it at all. But G-d desired that the good in creation should be all the more sharply defined by its contrast with the rejected evil; that human life should be an exercise in refinement – in distinguishing between the calories of divine energy and the sludge of putrid waste in our own self and character, our environment and our world. Indeed, the very concept of good, as we know it, would be devoid of all meaning were it not for the challenge of rejecting the evil that vies for validation and indulgence.)<a name="_top9" href="#_end9"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[9]</sup></a></p>

	<p><a name="_top1" href="#_end10"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[10]</sup></a>Based on the above, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, explains the following
	incident related in the Talmud:<a name="_top11" href="#_end11"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[11]</sup></a></p>
	
	<p>Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, Rabbi Yehushua and Rabbi Akiva were walking along the road when they heard the sounds of the crowds of Rome in the distance. They began to weep, but Rabbi Akiva laughed.</p>
	
	<p >Said they to him: “Why are you laughing?”</p>
	
	<p >Said he to them: “Why are you weeping?”</p>
	
	<p>Said they to him: “These barbarians, who prostrate themselves before statues and sacrifice to idols, dwell happy and secure, while we – the footstool of our G-d (i.e. the Holy Temple in Jerusalem) was consumed by fire. Shall we not weep?”</p>
	
	<p>Said he to them: “That is why I am laughing. If for those who transgress His will it is so, how much more so is it for those who do His will.” (<i>Talmud,
	Makkot 24a-b</i>)</p>
	
	<p>Rabbi Akiva is saying: If the waste produced by the divine desire in creation can yield such pleasure for the hedonist, imagine the pleasure to be derived through the fulfillment of His will, which is the source of all pleasure!</p>
	
		<h4><i>On the edge of the Holy Land</i></h4>
	
	<p>
	Therein lies the deeper significance of the idolatory (of Peor)<a name="_top12" href="#_end12"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[12]</sup></a>, and the explanation of why the people succumbed to it on the eve of
	their entry into the Land of Israel.</p>
	
	<p>
	On the face of it, the idol worship (of Peor) was a particularly
	repulsive activity. In truth, however, this was but the physical
	encoachment of what a person does every time he prefers an unG-dly
	pleasure over a G-dly one: he is worshipping the offal of creation,
	venerating something whose only significance is its need to be
	rejected in favour of the energies that are extracted from it.</p>
	
	<p>
	This is why the vulnerability (to Peor) came about at the close of
	their forty-year sojourn in the desert, as they camped on the east
	bank of the Jordan River poised to enter and settle in the Land of
	Canaan.</p>

	<p>
	For forty-years, the people had enjoyed a wholly spiritual existence.
	They were fed, clothed and sheltered by daily miracles, leaving them
	free to pursue the divine wisdom of the Torah, without the
	distractions of the material state. Most telling of their state was
	the fact that the mann, the “bread from heaven” on which they
	lived, was wholly absorbed into their bodies, engendering no waste.
	They inhabited a spiritual idyll, in which the waste of creation was
	unknown.</p>
	
	<p>
	But now they stood at the threshold of a new era: they were about to
	settle the land, till its soil, engage in commerce and polotics –
	i.e., to live a physical life sustained by physical means. For the
	first time in their history as a nation, they were to be in direct
	contact with the nether levels of the Chain of Evolution – with
	that part of the cosmic digestive tract which sperates the waste from
	the body of creation. For the first time, they were called upon to
	differentiate between vital matter – matter that nourishes a
	spiritual end – and dead matter – matter as an end in itself.<a name="_top13" href="#_end13"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[13]</sup></a></p>
	
	<p>
	Not all were equal to the challenge. There was an outbreak of Peor
	worship<a name="_top14" href="#_end14"><sup style="color: lightgreen">[14]</sup></a> in the camp, as many were enticed by the psuedo-pleasures to be found in the undesirable by-product of creation. Until one man came, and with his selfless commitment, unclouded vision and
	decisive action, put a halt to the plague of Peor.</p>

	What would oppose that is, upon making contact
		with its soul and core, the desire to destroy it – or lead it into
		darkness. It is as if they need to feed off this life force, this
		divine desire to be. They take no pleasure in its being, but only in
		its demise.

		Analysis: 
		<ol style="list-style-type:hebrew">
			<li>If we imagined a chain, it has a
			beginning, source, and an end. Thus the end would be defined as the
			point furthest away from the source. Furthest in this sense would
			mean the most unlike the source. Something like the broken
			telephone. The further away from the source of the message, the
			more the message drifts from its original. Or if you imagined the
			light as the source, then it would be darkness on the other end. If
			it was life, then death would be the end. 
			
			<li>But what we are talking about here is
			process or chain of evolution from the source of evolution itself.
			Thus it must evolve from something to something else – and the
			only place the unity, perfection can move to, is the opposite of
			everything that it is.
			<li>Thus this evolution becomes an evolution
			from the source to whatever the source is not, and thus it becomes
			inconducive to whatever radiates along this chain of evolution.
			<li>Thus if we name the Source, G-d, then the
			statement of whatever G-d desires, is inconclusive. Because this
			very chain of evolution is G-d’s desire. For nothing can exist
			without G-d wanting it to exist. Thus, it is not contrary to G-d’s
			desires, unless we interpret G-d’s desire to be what radiates
			from the Source, and thus as it gets further and further from the
			Source, it begins to contain less and less of it and thus is less
			able to conduct the “desire”.
			<li>Remember, this is not spatial, although
			we have to use spacial constructs to explain it. <a href="#_top5"><span style="color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold">↩</span></a>

			Interestingly enough, this is what happens to those who begin to descend into the

		Here in this case, when we speak of Rabbi’s, we are speaking of

		we continue to the story below, as my intention for this teaching is
		for it to accessible to as broad an audience as possible. Thus in
		the usage of some archetypes, we use a word that is common to our
		culture. However, we do not wish to restrict it only to that
		context. If we speak of G-d, we think of G-d as both transcendent
		and immenent, as the One that is everything, everywhere and without
		whom nothing would exist. It could be Ha’Shem, Jehovah, the Holy
		Spirit, Allah, the Source, the Creator, Great Spirit, Buddha, Jesus,
		the Holy Prophet, blessed be His name, and the names of all the
		prophets. These all call to that infinite Being that cannot be named
		by any name, by is called by all names.
	</p>
		
		<p>If we refer to anthing or anyone, include G-d,
		in a particular gender it is not to diminish any other. We could
		play the game of using She instead of He, or even It. But It is
		neither He nor She nor It. But we are restricted and constrained by
		the terms and manner of the language and its cultural norms. In
		English, we could use It. However, in Hebrew, there is no it –
		thus G-d is either He or She... and they chose He! Now we can turn
		all the He’s into She’s and then the gender problem will be
		solved....</p>
		<p>The debate over gender is only pertinent with
		the background of gender discrimination in a society. It has no
		intrinsic effect on that. Perhaps we have a bible that contains He
		and another version that uses She instead. The first is used by the
		men, and the second by the women. BTW, if that was done in the
		Hebrew bible, it would require the verbs to be changed to the
		feminine form in these cases too. 
		</p>
		<p>I would rather seek to understand what we mean
		when we use He and what aspect of G-d are we expressing when we use
		the feminine pronoun. Let us explore deeper the feminine expression
		of G-d, and then only change those. We could possibly continue to
		use the masculine form of the verb, as is often done in modern
		Israel, with the feminine pronoun. I have to point out that there
		are many commentaries, some relying on the Gematria (numeration) of
		verses to derive certain conclusions. Many of these would no longer
		be relevant if we amended the text. Finally, how are you ever going
		to convince us to change a text that is millinia old?<a href="#_top11"><span style="color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold">↩</span></a>
