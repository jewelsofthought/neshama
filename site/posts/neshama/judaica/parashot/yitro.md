n13-26:
Teacher sits, pupils stand as a sign of respect. It is the opposite today.
Sensible - mixed blessing

n13: Yom Kippur - day of forgiveness, when Jews forgive one another and join as a single nation

15:25] Marah - bitter
15:26] "Hearken. Do what is just. Give your ear to comman. Observe decrees" -> And no "disease"

If the narrative is circular (with reflections and symmetries), what decrees and ordinances is HaShem referring to? For He says: "I will establish my decrees and ordinances...

18: Why is the term "father-in-law" (חותן) used so often? Thirteen times in all.

Some sages say that it is to represent the change of loyalties of Yitro. That he has now become a part of the Mosaic family, and no longer of the Midianites.

However, it is also perhaps from the Jewish point of view of that he was no longer of importance as Yitro, the High Priest of the Midianites.

I believe he should be acknowledged for the support and sustenance that he provided Moshe Rabeinu.

N18:1] "Hand of Egypt" (3 times). Seems to be an expression of the time, for the Hand of G-d is also used often. How far one's hand stretches over the people. English: Keep it in hand; Get a hand(le) on it; I want a hand in it; Let's shake hands to close a deal;

18:17-24] Tree of Life

18:17] "I judge between a man and his fellow. I make know the decrees of G-d and his teachings!

- However this is before the receiving of the Torah at Sinai
- It also differentiates between G-d's decress and His Teachings!

18:21] Discernment

1. Men of accomplishment - meaning men of wealth. Which should enable them to resist pressure to influence judgment. {which we know is not true, because often these wealthy men of accomplishment are ones who have spent their lives accumulating and thus, unless G-d fearing, are likely to be easily swayed if it serves their purposes.}
2. God-fearing
3. Men of truth
4. Despise money

In a nutshell, one could describe them as "God-fearing men of Truth who despise money." This is where the need for men of accomplishment comes in.

> Moses ascends to G-d. G-d called him from the mountain
> n19-20: Delegated authority

19:1-2] Wilderness x 2
19:
-> Returns to Hashem
<- Mt on fire

- could the mountain not mean heights, just as the negev would mean south?

19:23] Hashem descends from above (mt); Moses ascends (mt)
Then descends to warn the people

{The mt is symbolic of a height that is above the norm. It also is indicative of the principle that G-d does not descend to our level, as low as us. He requires us to "ascend the mountain" - a spiritual mountain - in order to meet with Him. }

Ten Commandments (at end of Yitro)
I. Jealous G-d
II. Name in Vain
III. Sabbath
IV. Honour father & mother
V-IX. Not kill, adultery, steal, bear false witness
X. Covet

Miracles:
10 plagues, splitting of the Red Sea, cloud by day & fire by night,
sweeten the water, water from the rock

- ויחד - rejoice (Aramaic)

- "Tell them - seen what I can do":

1. Egypt : מצריים
2. Eagle : נשׁר
3. Brought you to Me: אָבִא אתכם אלי

- And now if you:

1. Hearken to Me : תשׁמעו בתולִי ( -> released from Egypt)
2. ֺObserve My Covenant ( -> fly as high as the eagle )

- Then you shall be to me
  1. Most beloved treasure of all My people : סגולה מכל העמים
  2. A kingdom of ministers : ממלכת כוהנים
  3. A holy nation : גוי קדוש ( -> close to G-d )
- ַאשׁר צוָּהוּ יהוה

Everything we shall do : כל אשׁר דבר יהוה נעשׂה

n22-23: With justice comes contentment
