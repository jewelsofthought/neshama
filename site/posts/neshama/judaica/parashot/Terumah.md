## Terumah "uplifting"

      They shall make for Me a sanctuary, and I will dwell within them (25:8)

      The verse does not say “and I will dwell within it,” but “and I will dwell within them”—within each and every one of them.

(Shaloh)

_Terumah_, a donation, to the _Mishkan_, the container in which the Ark of the Covenant was kept. This _parasha_ consists of detailed instructions on the building of the _Mishkan_ for the Jewish people.

This is a call to build a place for G-d's presence on this plane of existence. It is the same call that we hear today. For that is what we still need to do.

This _mishkan_ is not made from brick and mortar, but from specific materials, and defined by cloth. It can be carried around - thus saying that G-d is not necessarily in need of a static place. That is, its location is not the criterion for His residence on earth, but its qualities - the manner in which it is built and the manner in which the ceremonies of sacrifice and attendance are carried out.

Thus, in the desert it was a tent. In Jerusalem, it was a temple, from which it morphed into synagogues - allowing Jews in exile to continue our special relationship with G-d. Perhaps there is another iteration that is possible.

There is much to point to this in the writings regarding the temple of the Messianic age. For that is the time when the Upper Temple will be manifest in the lower worlds.

There are many projections of an upper (4th) dimensional object into the present (3rd) dimension we experience our lives in. This is how it will be, defined by spirit, and not by material. For that is the shift.

We need to build a [temple](https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1167/jewish/The-Answer-to-the-Mother-of-All-Questions.htm) for G-d to reside in. We need to make/create space in our lives where the Divine resides.

## The Name

G-d (etc) is the name of everything that is NOT man-made. This includes nature, and the so-called "Laws of Science", which are actually G-d's laws that science has discovered. Or, more accurately, a language, which we call science, that expresses the "natural/empirical" laws, making them accessible to anyone who is willing to learn the language that deals with that particulate. Thus making them accessible to a far larger segment of the population

## אַמָּה (Ammah) "a cubit"

Derived from אם - mother.

This word we have rendered as a cubit has a strange derivation. I realise it would be bending the accepted meaning, but what if it did mean something else. Perhaps there is other information we can receive from this word - not just 17.5 inches long...

It derives from mother, as in a parent, as well as in something like a mother-city. The word, without vowels, can mean nation as well. It is almost always used in the singular, and in 15 cubit long, though there is a plural. There is also one rendition in (Is or Job?) that no one knows its meaning. It is used once to refer to the foundation of the tent. What if it is not a linear measurement?

Even if it was, and there were men like Goliath (who was supposed to be about 9 feet tall) and his ancestors who once walked the earth (perhaps referred to as the _Annakim_ in the bible), and they, being much larger, could have first used an _Ammah_ to measure. Even if this was the length of a forearm, perhaps it was a much larger one...

## Israel vs. Jew

The name Jew derives from Yehuda, the eldest son of Jacob, and is often used to refer to the Jewish people, as a nation. However, often the nation is referred to as the sons of Israel, or the nation of Israel - not his son, Judas.

This is the question I ask, in light of the previous, is whether we are accurate assessing the meaning of the word "cubit".

## Practical Man

Many times have I struggled over these parochial pieces in the Torah. Lists of names, countless counting, and here, the exact measurements of the _Mishkan_, in an extremely detailed description of every piece that was to be in it, its materials and its form. {How come no one has reproduced it since - even in movies? Perhaps because we are not yet ready to?} This will appeal to the literal man's mind. The man of action, a builder, not a dreamer.

Here is the classic divide between the "simple" man, the man who lives his life according to what is in front of him, and the "dreamer", the mystic whose focus is on the other world. The split between _Halacha_ and Kabbalah, between Confuciusism and Taoism. This is the part of the Torah that he can relate to, and thus engage in discussion about. Though if we try to fit this literal version into reality, it soon begins to show strain. For instance, how could the whole nation come together in such a small space, if there were two-million or so souls in the desert? How could one sacrifice that amount of animals during the festival on an alter that was only Xcubits long by Ycubits wide? How long would this take? Think of the immense amount of blood that must have been shed.

How long was an _Ammah_ anyway, if it was a measurement....

## Some items

- **שׁולחן** (_shulchan_) - Table
- workbench/altar (with sacred objects on it, different from the altar where the sacrifices took place. The first is a "static" altar, a place in time, whereas the second is moving/dynamic/functional altar, where sacrifices occur.
  **מנורה** (_menora_) - Candelabra
- calls to the upper light to illuminate the darkness for us.
  **ארון** (_aron_) - Altar
- empty, unless **HaShem** fills it.
- blood services and sacrifices take place.

## Ancient Jewish Compass - AME

Based on the west-east axis, rather than the modern-day north-south one. This is because east is where the sun rises, and the new day begins. Astrologically, one's birth can be thought of as the snapshot/map of the moment of your birth. And the baseline that is used is the rising sun, which is termed your ascendant.

![The Compass](/posts/img/neshama/judaica/jewish_compass.svg)

The E-W line is a constant direction no matter where you are located on the planet (except for the neighbourhood of the N-S axis). The eastern direction which you are facing is into the rising sun, the new day, whereas, when facing the north (in the northern hemisphere), you are orientated to the cold, the dark, the hidden.

In addition, the baseline of E-W is the equator, whereas there is an arbitrary baseline through Greenwich, England that is was determined by the then ruling empire and which has now became the de-facto baseline. My point here is that the first is determined by man, the second is a "natural" baseline easily verified and absolute across the globe. It is like using the size of a drop of water to determine a centimetre, as opposed to the length of the current regent's foot.

Notice (fig 2) that there is no up nor down in this interpretation. The up and down motion, the axis mundi, is tantamount to entering another dimension. {Live in essentially a 2d world, as we have been surface bound for many generation. It is only in the last century that we have begun to truly experience 3d en-masse.}

{I use N-S because it places N above S in the culture that represents this. Whereas I use W-E, because that is the direction of forward movement. When moving along the E-W line, one's forward movement is in the same direction as the earth. What a boost!

The S-N line has no up or down orientation, except for the fact that it arose as a baseline from the North, and so the cultural tendency is to refer to the north as up. However, the experience of North/South is different in the northern hemisphere to that in the Southern. Cold is south in the south, but north in the north. Sunnier and hotter is towards the north in the south, and the south in the north. Thus, even though the north south lines remain constant, the environment changes according to location.

In fact the Jewish calendar was based on quite a local environment, with the desert being in the south, and the cold being in the north. Some say it is even based on the setting of the mishkan.

The E-W compass is also easily represented as a circle, which has no up or down. Only once it is placed on a rectangular grid, can one begin to make such distinctions, which is, in main, just a negative (diminishing) or a postive (increasing).

In a spiritual sense, there is no different between the East wherever you may be, however, one can have a different sense of place on the north south line, wherever one may be. Perhaps the spiritual, not the emperical, meaning of the direction changes according to place. {This bolsters the idea that there might be other temples that need to be built. In fact, many.

But here we see the equator as the "crossing" line. The "meanings" cross over, reflect, along the N-S axis. Whereas the W-E line is following the spin of the earth, another "natural" phenomenon, and is invariant over most of the planet.

So perhaps it is necessary to take such cultural prejudices into account, and accept that the characteristics of the 4 directions might differ. meaning of the differ according to location. Will we one day be able to maintain our balance in a space of such multitudinal meaning? Will we be able to manage this refletion? {It is similar to the way medicine has been ignoring the basic fact that women have one of their chromosomes that is different (a relection of) to the man. This would of course influence the effect of the said medicine/chemical.}

This can only be done if there is a firm foundation upon which you can rely on. This foundation does not have to be universal, except in the assertion of G-d's unity (which is, of course, based on the Truth of His Existence).

In this there is the melding of science and spirituality - something that was once known as Alchemy. The science of the compass requires magnetic north to orient itself, whereas the spiritual/human compass requires/uses the sun to orientate itself.

This is the merging (modern word: {[entanglement](entanglement.html)} ) that is necessary in order to build the temple for G-d on the earth.
