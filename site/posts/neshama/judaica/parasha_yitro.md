18: Why father-in-law 13 times? The answer given is to show his connection to the children of Israel, and that his connection to Moshe Rabeinu had become important in his life. Still, 13 times - that seems excessive. There seems some mystery around this man. Besides being a high-priest of the Moabite people, he also had many names&mdash;which could point to some confusion around who he really was.

Yitro is another example of the Lord appearing and guiding people from other cultures.

:17 Moses:

> "I judge between a man and his fellow. I make know the decrees of G-d and His teachings.

However, this is way before we received the Torah.

There is a nice line of thought as Moses being the living embodiment of the Torah. Thus, he already lived by the ordinances and decrees even before he heard them from G-d.

17-24: Tree of Life

19:1-2: Wilderness x 2

**1st**: Moses ascendes to G-d, as called called him from the mountain.
