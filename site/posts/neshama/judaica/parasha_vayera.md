# Parashat Vayera

There are many angles that one can enter this space. It has many Shamanic aspects to it, one could take it as a shamanic journey.

_"Hashem appeared to him"_ (end)

In the English rendering, it begins with the name, "Ha'Shem". This is a key to the fact that we are entering sacred space. This is as a fundamental principle of Jewish Descents is to set one's intention and one's vision on G-d, and "encountering" the Divine Emanation.

[NOTE: To "encounter" the Divine needs not to be interpreted literaly. It is not like meeting the President, or the CEO of your company. It is an "entering into Divine Space" and becoming entangled with it. And one can only become entangled with a space that one "harmonises" with, otherwise it will be a hostile engagment - which we call "Evil" or "Satanic".
We think it is G-d that has changed perhaps, and has become evil, even though all the texts say He is Good. But, seen in the light of a negative or positive charge approaching a similar charge. Remember, in the material realm, like rejects like, or, opposites attract - while in the spiritual realm, like attracts like.]

This requires preparation and purification (which we do not do anymore - wash our bodies and our hands, but when (and how) do we cleanse our spirits?

We read that "Ha'Shem appeared to him". [Is this suggesting that G-d comes and goes? That He is inconsistent - or judged so? No. It is we who open our hearts and eyes to receiving Him. That is, "seeing that which has always existed" for the first time.] We could also use this ontology to say that "He was visited by Ha'Shem".

The chapter is named "vayera", and can be rendered as "It will be seen", a looking that is the looking into the future. "You will see", and hence "appeared" because of the future tense is often rendered as the past in Torah.

In Hebrew, Ha'Shem is not even the first word. In fact, it is the third. So, the sentence is not really, "God appeared to him", but more. "Will be seen by him, the Divine". I emphasise this because in it are some instructions. In is describing that in order for It to appear, one must have "looked" for It, or be looking for It, and then "find"/"see" it. This requires a certain inner stillness, an ability to listen (concentrate), and, most importantly, hear - which is to receive the sound/message.
