# Parashat Balak

What has always interested me is the bad rap that Balaam has received. This attitude has bothered me, as it appears in a number of significant places. For instance, Jacob is the good guy, and Esau the bad one, though, as the story unfolds, Jacob is the one that lies and betrays his brother's and his father's trust. Is it because he is a not of Israel? And thus cannot be claimed as a Jewish prophet?

> [Prophecy](prophecy.html)
> Or is that a certain, special type of prophecy has been granted to the children of Israel, and a different prophecy laid upon the other peoples? Perhaps the people of the Holy Land, sons of Zion, are able to receive the prophecy directly. While the others receive indirectly, through other means? This would explain their need for deification of the messenger!

> But this is something that is only granted to those who are of Jewish blood. That is, once again, materialising what is spiritual. It is granted to all those who live in the Holy Land - which is not Israel (I am dreadfully sad to announce). This is shown by the fact that after two-thousand years of praying, and begging, and wanting to return to the Land of Israel, the people rush headling creating a nation that does not put G-d and His Commandments in the forefront of all that they do. From the beginning, all of it is rejected as extinct (or expired) - at least no longer relevant. Yet it is this very "narrative" that brought us back to Israel - which we then fill with all the detritus of the modern, godless society that run the world today.

> No, it is those, all over and everywhere who still firmly and deeply and authentically believe in God, and try to live their lives serving as best they understand G-d's Will. Even if they fail, at least they are trying. They are believers. And in what do they believe? In a heaven on earth, as idealistic as that might seem, where we can live as human beings and interact in the way that most human beings wish to - kindly and lovingly - unless they have been twisted into some obscene shape by the non-believers.

Although Balaam has been portrayed as an evil man (who deserved to die at _Ba'al Peor_), in this reading - which, I must point out, is not named after him, but after the King, Balak, who coerced Balaam into cursing the Jewish people - he is not portrayed as an evil man.

> [Balak](Balak.html). Perhaps there is also a deeper lesson hidden here, as we evolve and gain deeper insight into the words. We punish the perpetrator of a crime, the one who harms the other, even if he or she is carrying out the crime in the name or under the authority of someone else. We do not tend to go over the one who is issuing the orders. This is an pertinent exaple of this. Balak is actually the one behind Balaam's crime. Thus it make sense for the reading to be named after Balak, as he is the true perpetrator of Balaam's sin. Balaam would not have sinned so without Balak incentives.

Looking at the story, a king (albeit temporary according to some texts) of a powerful nation requests that he, Bilaam, curse this people of Israel, who, to be honest, pose a threat to his kingdom. I mean, if a tribe of [nomadic people](nomads.html){what today has become refugees! For nomadic people naturally move with the seasons} had to appear at your border, you would be a little concerned too.

I must also admit to a modicum of confusion about what the relationship of Moab was to Midian. Why did Balak consult the Midianite elders as well? Was this due to an alliance that he wished to forge with them? But if he wanted to use Balaam, why then did he approach the Midianite elders before doing so?

Balaam really did not have too much of a choice. When a powerful king, Balak, enlists your aid, how do you refuse him? It will play out today as well. If the president asks a person for something...

After the event, he had upset Balak, and thus the Midianites – who obviously were interested in enlisting his (Balaam’s) aid. He tried to make amends by advising them to engage the Israelites by enticing them with their women. He obviously had more connections to the Moabites and the Midianites than to the Israelites, and he needed to “repair” these relations after blessing the Israelites instead of cursing them. So he offered them this advice.

Numbers Chap 22: 1. Interesting that it becomes named after Balak, who wished to curse the children of Israel, and not Balaam, who is the actual “hero” or protagonist in this portion. 2. v8: Upon the emissaries of Balak appearing before Balaam to induce him to curse the people, he responds to them, saying: “Spend the night. And if the Lord will speak to me. . .” He does not just succumb to their offer of reward, but says “if the Lord will speak to me”, in other words he must first wait for “instructions” as to how to proceed.
There are more aspects to this interaction, for instance, although Balaam is not from the children of Israel, he is visited and speaks regularly with the Lord. How is that? It seems he has some way of communicating with the Lord, and is familiar enough to be able to hear and understand Him. We find examples of this peppered across the Torah. It seems, as well, that he is fairly competent at this communication, for one, he is known as a prophet, in addition, he asked them to stay the night, not longer, for him to “speak with the Lord.”
We could ask the question of whether it is the same Lord God that he is speaking to? But there is only one Lord in the Torah.
Be that as it may, what I find fascinating is that he has communication with the Lord of Israel, even though he is not of the tribe of Israel. 3. v9: And as we see in v 9, he is correct, and indeed that evening “the Lord comes to Balaam, and speaks to him”. What is strange here, is that He asks him, “Who are these people?” as if he would not know.
v12: This time, as we read, He tells Balaam to send them away. “Do not go with them.” 4. They do not desist, and return again and again, offering him more and more. 5. v18: The final offer, almost open ended, is presented. “I will reap rewards and bounty upon him”. As if to say, name your price. Balaam again tells them to stay the night, as before, and that he has to ask the Lord, for as he clearly states, “I cannot transgress the Lord”, even though they offer him riches beyond his wildest dreams. 6. v20: Again the question: “Who are these men?” Why is He asking? What is missing here?
This time the response however is “Go with these men, if they are emissaries of Balak.” 7. Immediately upon Bm setting out on his journey, we read that him heading out on this mission “Invokes the wrath of the Lord.” Why is that, I ask? In v20 he says if they are Balak’s people, go with them?” So why did that arouse anger in the Lord?
Nevertheless it did, and He immediately dispatches an angel to. . . kill him? 8. Now we have the saga of the she-donkey, referred to hear as אָתון, though the Hebrew word for donkey is Chamor. What does _aton_ actually mean? I ask this, because I ask what sort of animal this was that he “rode” on. For it is turns out that this _aton_ sees angels and can speak (or communicate) with us.
It is interesting that the angel appears 3 times, for the triple repetition is common. 9. v28: “He opens the mouth of the donkey” and the donkey speaks, quite rationally.
Some might say that it was the Lord who spoke through the mouth of the donkey, and that it was rational speech, might even be used as evidence of this. That might be sufficient for many, but I would like to see if I can understand it on a more prosaic level, for if one invokes the first explanation, then it overrides all others, and this statement eradicates any other possible explanation, and allows the commentator to continue, without having to wrangle with the depths of this teaching.
In addition, why, if He had sent an Angel down, was it then necessary for the Lord Himself, Blessed be His Name, to have to speak through the mouth of a donkey? Why use a donkey – and not the angel that He had sent down? Is it perhaps that until Balaam’s eyes were open to seeing the Angel, he could not hear it either? Why is that? [It is common for the it to be said that the angel comes down, and the Lord, Blessings on all that He does and Is, speaks to him.
How did he so easily understand and accept that the donkey could speak, and so rationally, to him? For he does not seem surprised by the donkey’s conversational tone. Surely he would have realised at that point he was being addressed by the Lord, if that was the case.

This is such an enigmatic scene. Riding along on my donkey on a lovely day, my mind focused on this finely balanced goal of cursing the tribe of Israel for Balak, and suddenly my donkey speaks to me – in Aramaic or was it Hebrew – nevertheless in a language that I understand. Although, the Lord, who is All, can fashion and do anything, the actual mouth and tongue and vocal cords are not sufficient for it to speak in a human fashion – not that that would be a problem for the One that is Omnipotent. But why? Why not make it easy, and send someone, an angel even, to give him the message – just like the three strangers that came to Avraham, our father.

I say that there is a “universal” language (I hesitate to call it a language – unless we decide to define a language as a set of symbols which are meaningful to the transmitter and the receiver. This could be sounds, shape, engravings, statues, images, etc. It could also be “chashmal” – the silence that speaks – for to speak is to “communicate” symbols. One could call it a type of telepathy – soundless communication, a “mental” transfer of images. It is “as if” it was speaking. One can hear the words, but there is no voice.

    10. v30: He opened Balaam’s eyes, just as He opened the mouth of the donkey.  Although the Lord, who is King over all, opens Balaam’s eyes to see the angel (v30), He never opens his ears to hear Him (nor the donkey’s) speak. There is also the aspect of hearing – and understanding. For the donkey understood and answered Balaam quite clearly.
    11. v32: The angel now speaks to Balaam, using similar language as the donkey. [Does it say that?]. So, telepathy is a modern word, perhaps the more ancient and accurate word would be “angelic communication”. But why was Balaam thwarting the Lord’s wishes, when he had been instructed to go with them? And why was the Angel sent to kill him? And if the sentence was capital punishment – what was the mortal sin that Balaam had committed? Was he being punished for or by killing him, would prevent, the heinous act of cursing the tribe of Israel – of whom he was not a member, and who was being coerced by a powerful king to act. It seems that the sentence was rather server, and  if the sentence was that severe, how could the donkey’s seeing the angel have saved Balaam? How is that just the fact the she saw the Angel was sufficient to annul his punishment?

Balaam then offers to return, unaware of the Lord’s wrath, until the Angel announces it. 12. v35: However, the Angel’s response is for him to continue. Now if that is the case, then what was the previous “drama” about? I mean, Balaam was just obeying orders. . .
v38: What is added here are more explicit instructions on “speaking My words”. Did He not say that when he told Balaam to set out on his journey?
[I have just stumbled over the circular method of narrative that was apparently used for biblical stories. This would explain the strange circlularity of some of the narrative. Apparently it is a style that was common in those times. Today, it seems we have a more linear, or deterministic, way of telling our stories. Not that the story lines do not interweave, but it is more like a double helix arrangement, but seldom are the circular.
What I find interesting here, is there is no mention of the dignitaries nor the two servants that accompanied him when he set out. Which makes the use of the donkey even more interesting – for why not use one of the servants to speak to him instead? Why us the donkey...
Chap 23: 13. v4: After preparing the first ceremony, the Lord “chanced” upon Balaam. What does “chanced” mean in this context? The Lord just happened to bump in to him on His way to. . .?” 14. Anyway, He “placed” something in Balaam’s mouth – “say as follows”. It is both scary and exciting when the Lord places something in my mouth. When I am fully conscious and present with the words that come from my mouth, it seems that it is the Lord that is speaking. The times when I am unaware of what I am really saying, are the times that it my Nefesh that is speaking 15. Balaam reiterates in v8, “How can I go against the Lord?”. And again in v12: “I must speak what the Lord puts into my mouth.” 16. v15: “I will be chanced (upon) here?” so says Balak. Is this referring to Balak or to G!d? (using Anochi - אנוכי). He could also be referring to Balaam, as the chancer. Will I be tricked (chanced) here too? But he is correct, for it says: The Lord chanced upon Balaam. v16. 17. Again Balaam says he has no choice, but must speak the Lord’s words.
Chap 24: 18. v1: Balaam saw 19. v2: “Spirit of God rested on him”. So there is Balaam, not a Jewish prophet, who is visited by the Lord. As a result, this time G!d doesn’t put anything in his mouth, he just speaks – calling himself “the man with an open eye.” 20. v4: Lovely description 21. v13: After blessing the Jews, again Balaam says he cannot transgress the Lord’s wishes to Balak. 22. v4 = v15: open eye 23. v17-v24: strange prophecies
Changes:
Baal Peor: 24. v4: Hang the leaders 25. v5: The judges to kill the leaders. The leaders of what? Of the people. Or of specific people? Were there leaders who were leading this assimilation that was occurring?
Pinchas 26. v6: bring woman into camp “in front of the eyes of Moses and the eyes of the children of Israel, who are weeping.” Why are they weeping? Is it because of what he is doing? Or is it because of the plague? 27. v8: Pinchas kills the two of them, and then the plague ceases. A plague, which killed 24k, that we did not hear about until now, unless we connect it with the “wrath of God” mentioned previously in v3. If the plague killed all those who were fraternising, then who did the Judges need to kill?
