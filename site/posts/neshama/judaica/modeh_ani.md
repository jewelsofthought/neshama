> החזרתי בי נשׁמתי
> "You returned my soul to me"

This is an expression of the Trinity.
'You' (G-d) returned my 'soul' to within 'me', meaning within my 'body'.
The body referred to here is not really mine, but was provided to me by G-d.

Is there a 4<sup>th</sup> element here? For the question that turns here, is the who am 'I' that is having this morning experience? Who is the one praying? It is not 'You, G-d', it is not my body, though it does the actions. The only conclusion that I come to here, is the I am the soul that is referred to here. Not the You, and not the body.

So this is my response. You are of the angels, descended from the realm of the Elohim. The soul that is returned is also of the angelic realm, known as Ruach, and the 'I that "I am". The "identification" of the said soul is the becoming the portal of the mystery. The alpha of me, the one who stands at the gate representing the first emergence from the luminous Oneness that is the source of creation. B'Sh.
