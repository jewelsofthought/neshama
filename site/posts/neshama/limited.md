## (in)Finite Beings

> The intelligence that can conceive of infinite is not necessarily itself infinite!

If we are finite beings (a fact), then no part of our beings can be infinite, meaning that there is obviously a limit to our human intelligence. Even if we could record and retain all human knowledge, it would still be finite. How would we know that we have reached the limit of our "intelligence". How does a child know learn that? By encountering those that know more than him, and hopefully, he can then learn to learn from others. Thus hopefully growing into an adult who can acknowledge his or her limitations, especially in the areas of intelligence! An old adage says that it is only a fool who thinks he has nothing more to learn.

## Finite intelligence

What if our intelligence was limited? Surely, we do not believe that we have infinite intelligence, do we? Even if there are those deluded beings who think that they are or can become, if not gods themselves, at least like gods - they know, in their true hearts, that they are not of infinite intelligence (or infinite anything - except for the "part" that can conceive of the infinite itself) - one has to acknowledge that not everyone has that capacity.

Perhaps all this talk of level IV civilisations, stems around our ability to actually comprehend a technology that would be able to take us, whilst still in human form, as human beings to such an advanced and sophisticated level of empirical existence. This level of technological progress would require another set of cognitive capabilities - which most of us do not yet have. It would take (and has in the past) many years of training, and only those with specific talents would be able to complete it. All would benefit, and some would be harmed, but overall, it would require a certain set of "special" people - the "Indigos", to penetrate these arcane veils. It would require a mixture of magic and form, a melding of the spiritual and the material - with angelic or 4th dimensional "intelligence".

As, in each step of evolution, there are those who will remain behind to hold the foundations. One cannot ascend to a higher level without the lower levels being stable and nourished. They will continue to transact and relate in the 3d and 2d realities present today. These will be the ones who will enter the World to Come, and like Bodhisattvas, will guide and balance the energies of these vibrant dimensions, bringing greater fulfilment and understanding to many - as they have done throughout the ages. The only difference now, is that this is the birth time of this evolution. History is littered with failed attemps, ideas that never made it to print, that later emerged. Or that emerged in a disjoint part of the world. When the time of an idea/direction comes, the idea will emerge.

_NOTE: Which would bolster the argument that we are going to need some other sort of understanding, some part of our mental capacities that we have not yet discovered/acknowledge, let alone plumbed - perhaps due to fear, we rather stay tethered to this purely material existence. At least it is rooted in something. As we have been saying for a long time - it will require a dynamic balance, between co-operation and competition for as to evolve._

Perhaps our vaunted intelligence can only see so far. In other words, what if we are bounded in "thought" and comprehension. For the eye to see, the brain has to be able to evaluate what it is seeing. Otherwise, the data arrives, but nothing is done with it. It is indicative of the miles of printed paper that lies trashed and useless. In order for something to be seen, it requires a seer - i.e. transmitter/receiver!

It seems that we are driven at this stage by the belief that we humans can design AI to "increase our capabilities". I do believe we can/are able. Through bioengineering, we physically enhance the machine that is our body, but we do not enhance the mental or emotional capabilities. Thus it might produce a type of an android, or rather a Golem - a Frankinsteinian monster that we have built, but have no idea how to handle its emotional needs.

Perhaps we extend ourselves to the limit of our consciousness...

_Which again, brings us to an interesting paradox, of actually, the belief in an infinite (or at least, greater) consciousness is what drives this desire to expand. There is a common desire to encounter the Infinite._

_Two ways:_
_1. encounter to kill; pain of the rejection; feeling alone and despairing; having cried out to G-d, and not been answered (or so it seems). Has become this. So, rather than meet, it wants to devour and destroy everything that reminds him of his Father. This has much noise, much glam. It has to sell itself all the time, as exactly what it is not._
_{As I mentioned - one of its main drives is to (dis)prove the Infinite's existence - by encountering it and destroying it (which will prove that we are superior to that which bore/created us - and the world in which we exist by the way)}_
_2. encounter to unify. meet by acceptance and receptiveness; opening oneself to the Truth. Based on a belief in my Father. That He has not abandoned me. That He guides me, and speaks to me all the time, in His language, the language of_ Chashmal _, which can only be heard in silence._

and then fall back. An ever repeating tower of Babel. That, too, is [the cycle that lives in everything](oroborus.html), especially the living. Our breath, the day, the very cosmos itself. The endless cycle of Samsara, gain and loss, expand/contract, transmit/receive.
