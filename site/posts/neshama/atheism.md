## Athiest

G-d is removed from the equation by the atheist, replacing it with some other belief system. Today we have replaced it with science, the ultimate expression of the rational mind or so it is described by its believers while not taking into account that the limitations of rationality.

If there is G!d present at the places where we are not being human, but beastial then we blame G-d for allowing the inhumanity to continue. If we remove G-d from the scene, then whom do we blame? Will that enable us to take responsibility for our actions? If it is human No-one - as there is no repurcussions, except the emperical ones. Now we have reached a trans-human stage, where there are elements in this G-dless realm that believe we can replace G-d with AI - despite overwhelming evidence as to the risks and failures of such an approach.

If there is a G-d, and we act abominably, we blame G-d for creating us (humans) that way.

If we deny the existence of G-d, and we act abominably, who then do we blame? No-one, for there is no-one to blame, and we may conclude that that is just the way human beings are. If we replace the religious doctrine with a scientific one (eg. evolution) which supports this violent behaviour, then the jaws of the beast can close upon us.

The essence of a religious doctrine is that at its core exists something that is greater than the human conundrum. At its center, exists a being, a consciousness that is above and beyond ours. One that is perfect and merciful and good, all in a manner that is beyond anyone's comprehension, and thus can only be held in faith and in belief. If we do not believe that there is a better life, a better way for people to live than to kill and brutalise one another, one that is achievable - what hope or future do we have to look forward to?

If we remove G-d, blessed be His name forever, the saviour from our equation, then we are left with a human being the ultimate consciousness (as we would then acknowledge no other), and we have plenty of examples of said consciousness being insufficient and incapable in many circumstances.

For those who follow this atheistic doctrine, [AI](ai.html) would be the ultimate solution. Through the implementation of this AI system, the powerful elites would be able to embed their positions of power. Which is happening as I speak.

> [AI](ai.html): A note on AI: Perhaps we have had such systems throughout history, just not referred to as AI. But any system that is imposed from the outside, and forces people to live in a certain imposed manner, is a form of AI. Legal systems are just that.

## G!d is King

The expression of a king is the belief that there are those amongst us who may be above us and control us like gods. Thus, the desire to be king is the ultimate expression of ego. When one reaches this pinnacle of desire it is manifested by one's entire world being a reflection of the king's ego. Anyone or anything that doesn't agree with his ego is immediately ejected.

The problem that occurs here is that a king cannot fully control those who believe in G!d. They cannot be broken from the outside. They stand against the absolute power that the king desires. If G!d is the King, then there is one who stands above the earthly king&mdash;and that is revolutionary.

However, having removed the dependency on G-d, replaced with pseudo-science and AI, which the king controls, enabling the king to begin to gain complete control over his people.

## Armageddon

This will herald in an end of days. It is clearly a fight between [good and evil](good_evil.html) It is not a physical fight&mdash;though there may be much fighting that happens&mdash;but a spiritual one. The battle, as usual, is narrowing to be between those that fear G-d, the G!d-fearing, and those that hate G-d, the G!d-hating.

> [Good & evil](good_evil.html): Good always gives you a choice; evil never does. Good supports and nourishes life; evil produces death, destruction, violence and misery.

Soon there will be no middle way. Either you are with me, or you are against me bifurcation will grow, and you will have to end up in one camp or the other.

## Anthropos

The ego (_nefesh_), or Id, as Freud called it, can never be reduced or change shape&mdash;just like a living cell. It is only affected by what is in it, what it absorbs, and what is occurring in its local environment.

Our future requires the creation of the Anthropos. Each one of us, a cell in the body of this Anthropos, and together we have to form it&mdash;but first we have to imagine it. It is not formed from the dust of the earth, but from our light&mdash;our living spirits joining to produce a Living Spirit that will "flutter over the living waters". A Spirit that will imbibe all, and enable us to see one another in such a way that we will be able to know each other's truth. That we could build such an anthropos will be based on Truth and Lovingkindness/Compassion.

## Temple

Just as the future temple will be imaginary, so will the Presence that will rest there. If we could always live with the temple at our center, we all will have a place to congregate and celebrate our One. When we depart from that place, we will need to return to being human&mdash;with all our failings and aspirations. In any human society, one must expect every possible human quality and characteristic to at some point, emerge. There is no human system that can exclude the humanity in humans, else it will grow to become inhuman or non-human or even anti-human. The only system that we can create that is perfect is one that will have no place for humans to be human.

## Balanced

1. Clear demarcation between inner and outer
2. Equal energy transfer
3. Balanced power exchange
4. Clear communication - not necessarily verbal
5. Self-sovereign

## Unbalanced

1. Unclear boundaries
2. Confusion between inner and outer space
3. Confusion over identity (non-sovereign)
4. "Agreements" and "contracts" to ensure "safety"
5. Against law of change.

Seek to create order and balance through not "allowing" change to occur.
