## Speak of Angels

When G-d first started the creation of the world, He wanted it to be made up only of _chesed_, light and love.

Heaven/Garden of Eden. Lived in peace and love and harmony. Praised G-d continuously, sang beautiful harmonies together, everything they did was in service to G-d, the never erred, never fought, all was peaceful and fulfilled.

But that was not the end of the emergence of Creation yet, it had not reached its ultimate goal. He knew that he had to ask the angels to descend lower, to, in a sense, clip their wings&mdash;but the gift of such a sacrifice would be to launch a world in which the miraculous could take place.

So He gathered the council around Him, and said to them: "You are my holiest, and the mightiest of my angels. I need you all to gather your minions, and choose those among you who will be blessed by carrying out a task in My Name.

This is what they will do. They will remove their wings every aeon, (what we know today as Plank's constant) and appear in and as My creation. From there others will direct you to your place. Each aeon you will appear in this guise until you are no longer needed. Know that you are My beloveds, and will be the forces that will form creation. Go forth and emanate, for I am going to create a world in which will live beings who will become the guardians of the realm of both good and evil."

The Lord said to these angels, of whom this story is about, "Go and be (quanta/atoms?) a specific piece of the puzzle we call creation." Because they were angels, they could do nothing else other than being what the Divine Will had them do.

So it was done.

It was the time when the angels were cavorting with the men and women in the Garden. Lilith, who was an angel, wanted Adam. But Samael was in love with her, and was arrogant, so he devised a plan to gain Lilith.

He came to Adam and said, "You are alone amongst the animals. None of them are a proper mate for you. I will fashion the one who will be your _b'shirt_, your beloved. So he put Adam into a deep sleep and extracted Eve from his side. Adam was immediately drawn to Eve, and was no longer interested in Lilith. Lilith, who was also arrogant, was upset with him, as she had always dominated and controlled that relationship. She began to think up ways to thwart Adam and Eve. So she convinced the Serpent, a being of great wisdom, who was also enamanoured by Eve, to seduce Eve, and get her to eat the fruit of the forbidden tree.

God, who had been struggling with the problem of His world not working properly, because it had become stagnant and was not unfolding as it should, realised that He had to do something. There was a whole realm that was not being attended to, and He realised that He needed someone in charge of that realm. But in order for there to be balanced, he had to have someone who was to be the Prince of the other, complimentary realm.

When Adam ate of the tree, G-d realised that something had changed. And somehow the very realm that He had been ignored, which was the actual reason that He had needed to create the world of humans, had entered into this perfection that He had created&mdash;for being perfect Himself, He could only create perfection.

He went to Adam and asked him, how come he had eaten of the fruit? Adam replied that Eve had convinced him to eat of it. He then asked Eve, who blamed the snake. So he sent them all out of the Garden and into the world he had made for them, with only the skins that He had covered them with in which to contend with the world of light and dark.

In the meantime, Samael, for being the angel who had shown Him what was needed to awaken the world was not _chesed_ alone, but also _gevurah_, constraint, or judgement, was given the lower realms to rule over, and became known as the Prince of Darkness. While Lilith, became a consort of his, and continued to interfere with all births that came from Adam and his descendants.

He also raised Enoch up into the heavens and appointed him Prince over all of creation, in that he forms and fashions all that exists, and was raised to become Melchezidick, the Prince of Light. He chose Enoch, because he was a man who was righteous in a world that had gone mad with lust.

The G-d had to close off the channel between the two realms of man and angel, and this caused the flood, where a new energy had to permeate the world, and the old ways were wiped out. However, what remained was all the things that the angels had taught us, like language, as well as writing and reading; to make fire, and harvest grain; to tame the animals and the wheel upon which we could load goods; to sow cloth; build buildings, etc.

However, He found that it was impossible to form anything with only the elements

I find it interesting here to note, that that is what we say about the beastly, what I refer to as 3d, existence. A beast can only behave as a beast behaves&mdash;it has no choice if it has no consciousness of being anything else, or the possibility of being anything but what it is. That, our sages say, is what makes us human&mdash;in that we have choice. We can choose what to believe. We can choose how to behave. We can choose to change. The lion cannot, and, it seems, neither can the angel. For that's what angels are supposed to be&mdash;perfect, unquestioning expressions of Divine Intent.

Now one might think that this job might have been a small job. Not so. It was an immense job. These angels, though very small, were immensely powerful. Each one became a point that held infinity in its grasp. You could imagine them as a gigantic, infinitely long, web, the strands of which are the (infinite) bonds that weave the reality in which we awaken. Each one was like superman, keeping these infinitely long, infinitely powerful energies joined, as long as he can. Each connection in its own fashion. They are what create(s) the web of our reality. They are not the _Elohim_, the great architects of the finite universe, the ones who fashioned stars, and brought living beings to fruition. They are the actual elements that hold and form the objects, living and static, that we have around us. They truly are angels, without whom we would not continue to exist for even one moment.

That they obey the Will of the Creator without any hesitation is what makes them predictable. Thus when we write formulae to describe their behaviour, we are in fact writing the Word of G-d down. This is how we will perceive His Will. For He is the one that Created everything, and thus His Voice is in everything. Those that completely obey His Will are then pure expression of His Being. These are the Words of G-d. Through these beings we can begin to understand His Words in a way that is unique, and perhaps inch closer to realising the true purpose of (our) existence.

These angels were often, what we might call, mischievous and entertained themselves in this way. Contrary to what might be someone's understanding of what it means to obey the Will of G-d as that of a place of obedience and lack of choice, these angels, being messengers of G-d do his bidding. However they do have a choice in _how_ they do it, for they are natural expressions of the creativity of the Creator. One could say within the _almost_ infinite possibilities inherent in the Infinite Being that are available to any entity, angels thus have a huge range of possible methods by which they can express the intent of the manifestation. They flit in and out of manifest reality, and the smaller they are, the more often they appear and dissapear. For if it is only a point of the (higher dimensional - or other worldly) object that you are able to perceive, it will naturally be very fleeting. Just as it is difficult to formulate a complete picture, or even a coherent one from something that one managed only to get a brief glimpse of.

In those days there were many that used their energy, blissfully unaware of the life force extant in each of them. That is part of what made it easy, for they were identified as a species, a type, and not as god-like entities.

There will always be qualities that they contain that will make them identifiable as a type, thus bringing us to the concept of a meta-angel. One who rules over a specific "tribe" of entities. In modern terminology it might be that one would call a tribe by strange names such as quarks or bosons, or more accepted ones like iron or sodium. The alchemists appreciated this, and knew that the energy of any object is divine energy.

## Truth & Shekhina

We have argued for millennia about the Truth. We have fought wars and conquered nations in the name of the Truth. We have committed unspeakable acts to convert others to our Truth. But the time of the Truth is over. With so much disinformation and junk information floating around, it is becoming nigh impossible to determine what is True and what is merely a viewpoint. But we can acknowledge that we know energy, and have no idea what it really is. That is the portal to the next paradigm. Realising that all energy is an expression of the Divine, and His messenger angels.

Those angels that interact with this realm, _Malchut_, are an expression of the feminine presence of the Divine Creator, which we named _Shekhina_, and refered to as the Divine Presence. She is the Divine Present that nourishes us, and everything around us. She is the one who rules over all the angels that have created this world in which we live.

The few that understood this, always visited after much preparation, always asking permission to enter. They were always humble and trembled in their awareness of awesome majesty of what they were encountering.

One day there was something strange trying to look for them. It had no mind of its own, but was a projection of the living entity whom they all served&mdash;in the sense of "for whom they were created". But it did not approach humbly. Nor did it request permission to enter. It came, a servant of its master, to measure and regulate and manipulate. So they just put up their shields, and everytime we look, this is what we now see.

## Angels and light

Angels are required to affect a certain amount. In our terms, we would say that they have a certain quota of light to distribute. During each cycle of their existence they see those who are worthy to receive the light. If they find enough, all is good and balanced. If not, they "randomly" distribute the others. This produces some of the mysterious quantum effects of randomness and probability.

Just to allay your objection to a random and fickle universe, as the wisdom by which these effects are produced is still unknown to us thus we call it random. Often those of us who deem ourselves unworthy pray for one of these "random" events.
