## Speak of Angels

The Lord said to these angels, of whom this story is about, "Go and be (atoms?) a specific piece of the puzzle we call creation."

Because they were angels, they could, of course, do nothing else other than being what the Divine Will had made them. {I find it interesting here to note, that that is what we say about the beastly, what I refer to as 3d, existence. A beast can only behave as a beast behaves&mdash;it has no choice if it has no consciousness of being anything else, or the possibility of being anything but what it is. That, our sages say, is what makes us human&mdash;in that we have choice. We can choose what to believe. We can choose how to behave. We can choose to change. The lion cannot, and, it seems, neither can the angel. For that's what angels are supposed to be&mdash;perfect, unquestioning expressions of Divine Intent.

Now one might think that this job might have been a small job. Not so. It was an immense job. These angles, though very small, they were immensely powerful&mdash;each on in its own way. Each one became a point that held infinity in its grasp. You could imagine them as a gigantic (infinite?) web, the strands of which were the infinite bonds that weave the reality in which we awaken. Each one was like superman, holding these infinitely long, infinitely powerful energies. Each one in its own fashion. They are what created the web of our reality. They are not Elohim, the great architects of the finite universe, the ones who fashioned stars, and brought living beings to fruition. They are the actual elements that hold and form the objects, living and static, that we have around us. They truly are angels, without whom we would not continue to exist of one moment.

That they obey the Will of the Creator without any hesitation is what makes them predictable. Thus when we write formulae to describe their behaviour, we are in fact writing the Word of G-d down. This is how we will perceive His Will. For He is the one that Created everything, and thus His being is in everything. Those that completely obey His Will are then pure expression of His Voice. This is the Words of G-d. Through these beings we can begin to understand His Words in a way that is unique, and will fulfil the prophecies.

They were often, what we might call, mischievous and entertained themselves in this way. Contrary to what might be someone's understanding of what it means to obey the Will of G-d as that of a place of obedience and lack of choice, these angels, being messengers of G-d and thus have to do his bidding, do have a choice in _how_ they do it, for they are natural expressions of the creativity of the Creator. One could say within the _almost_ infinite possibilities inherent in the Infinite Being that are available to any entity, angels have a huge range of possible methods by which they can express the intent of the manifestation. They flit in and out of manifest reality, and the smaller they are, the more often they appear and dissapear. For if it is only a point of the (higher dimensional - or other worldly) object that you are able to perceive, it will naturally be very fleeting. Just as it is difficult to formulate a complete picture, or even a coherent one from something that one managed only to get a fleeting glance of.

In those days there were many that used their energy, blissfully unaware of the life force extant in each of them. That is part of what made it easy, for they were identified as a species, a type, and not as god-like entities.

{godlike - there will always be qualities that they contain that will make them identifiable as a type, thus bringing us to the concept of a meta-angel. One who rules over a specific "tribe" of entities. In modern terminology it might be that one would call a tribe by strange names such as quarks or bosons, or more accepted ones like iron or sodium. The alchemists appreciated this, and knew that the energy of any object is divine energy.

We have argued for millennia about the Truth. We have fought wars and conquered nations in the name of the Truth. We have committed unspeakable acts to convert others to the Truth. But the time of the Truth is over. With so much disinformation and junk information floating around, it is becoming nigh impossible to determine what is True and what is merely a viewpoint. But we can acknowledge that we know energy, and have no idea what it really is. That is the portal to the next paradigm. Realising that all energy is an expression of the Divine, and His messenger angels.

Those angels that interact with this realm, _Malchut_, are ruled by the feminine presence of the Divine Creator, which we named _Shekhina_, and refer to as the Divine Presence. She is the Divine Present that nourishes us, and everything around us. She is the one who rules over all the angels that have created this world in which we live.

The few that understood this, always visited after much preparation, always asking permission to enter. Always humble and aware.

One day there was something starnge trying to look for them. It had no mind of its own, but was a projection of the living entity whom they all served&mdash;in the sense of "for whom they were created". But it did not approach humbly. Nor did it request permission to enter. It came, a servant of its master, to measure and regulate and manipulate. So they just put up their shields, and everytime we look, this is what we now see.

## Angels and light

Angels are required to affect a certain amount. In our terms, we would say that they have a certain quota of light bolts to distribute. During each cycle of their existence they see those who are worthy to receive the light. If they find enough, all is good and balanced. If not, they "randomly" distribute the others. This produces some of the mysterious quantum effects of randomness and probability.

Just to allay your objection to a random and fickle universe, as the wisdom by which these effects are produced is still unknown to us thus we call it random.

Often those of us who deem ourselves unworthy pray for one of these "random" events.
