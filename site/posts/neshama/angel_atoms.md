## Speak of Angels

The Lord said to these angels, of whom this story is about, "Go and be (atoms?) a specific piece of the puzzle we call creation.

In the beginning life was easy. They lazed around and did just what they did best and that was just being themselves. Because they were angels, they could, of course, do nothing else other than being what the Divine Will had made them. {I find it interesting here to note, that that is what we say about the beastly, what I refer to as 3d, existence. A beast can only behave as a beast behaves&mdash;it has no choice if it has no consciousness of being anything else, or the possibility of being anything but what it is. That, our sages say, is what makes us human&mdash;in that we have choice. We can choose how to behave. We can choose to change. The lion cannot, and, it seems, neither can the angel. For that's what angels are supposed to be&mdash;perfect, unquestioning expressions of Divine Intent.} Perhaps these angels, who are messengers of G-d, and thus have to do his bidding, do have a choice in _how_ they do it.

Now, these angels were very small, though they were immensely powerful&mdash;each on in its own way. They were often, what we might call, mischievous and entertained themselves in this way.

In those days there were many that used their energy, blissfully unaware of the life force extant in each of them. That is part of what made it easy, for they were identified as a species and not as separate entities.

They few that understood this, always visited after much preparation, always asking permission to enter. Always humble and aware.

One day they was something starnge trying to look for them. It had no mind of its own, but was a projection of the living entity whom they all served&mdash;in the sense of "for whom they were created". But it did not approach humbly. Nor did it request permission to enter. It came, a servant of its master, to measure and regulate and manipulate. So they just put up their shields, and time we look, this is what we now see.

## Angels and light

Angels are required to affect a certain amount. In our terms, we would say that they have a certain quota of light bolts to distribute. During each cycle of their existence they see those who are worthy to receive the light. If t hey find enough, all is good and balanced. If not, they "randomly" distribute the others. This produces some of the mysterious quantum effects of randomness and probability.

Just to allay your objection to a random and fickle universe, as the wisdom by which these effects are produced is still unknown to us, thus we call it random.

Often those of us who deem ourselves unworthy pray for one of these "random" events.
