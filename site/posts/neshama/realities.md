## Game of reality

Each one of us emerges in the set of rules we call reality. Just as in a card game (or any game) for that matter, where there are a set of rules, and within those rules, you have a given instance - a given expression of whatever occurs within those rules. Like, for instance, a soccer game between two teams is the occurance that occurs within a certain set of rules.

Each one of us is like a big game, with a team opposing, a team supporting and all the officials necessary to run the game, as well as an audience of both supporters and detractors.

## Mathematical reality

> When one moves between different realities, truth can be questioned, as it becomes relative to the reality under observation.

Some claim this reality is different from our mundane reality, yet it manages to describe it with eery accuracy. One could say that in the places of intersection between the two realities, mathematics describes physical reality extremely well, upsetting our assumptions and superstitions, thus challenging our mental view of reality.

For instance, is 1 + 1 = 2 a true statement? Is it a truth? Or is it a universal truth? Could it be expressed differently? Using a different language of symbols? If I asked and alien who spoke "---", would he agree with this statement? Finally, is there a reality in which 1 + 1 = 3? And what would that reality look like?

However, within the rules of mathematics, 1 + 1 = 2 is a truth statement. But in the realm of reality, that might be questioned.

### Roots of equation

## PEMS-X

I want to propose that we have four major levels to our perception of "human" reality. The ancients expressed this in terms of our relationship with this reality. These levels are physical, intuitive, symbolical/archetypical, and mysterious. Because, in essence, our relationship with "reality" is whole subjective, as we are the "subject" of the narrative we find ourselves embroiled in. We are the hand that has been dealt in the game of life.

## Koans - the non-rational

> "The sound of one hand clapping"; >
> "Where can you find Buddha?"
> "The sound of a tree falling in a forest with no one to hear."

These are conundrums for us. It introduces a discomfort that is caused by our embedding our human (or egotistical) patterns into our lives. One could say that all of reality is created by the acceptance and immersion of these patterns onto a background reality that works according to different rules. Rules that we will ignore, in a kind of trance of cognitive dissonance.

The Zen path is one that challenged our patterns, and is such a revelatory path. These patterns are what block us from having this revelatory experience.

When you find yourself stuck in your life, where greater effort will only produce small effects, you need to change a pattern. One cannot continue doing the same things and expect something to change.

There is much vocabulary that describes this conundrum in our modern vernacular, expressing many of the effects and challenges you might face on this path.

## Infinity from Finite

> Biblical creation $$\Rightarrow$$ evolution &mdash; sensibile, describing patterns we can see.

In the biblical days, people did not have as much knowledge available to them as we have today. The terms used to express such an incredible event as the creation would have to be expressed in much more simple and practical terms than those of today. We can handle the complexity of the idea of the big bang, and the "evolution" of the universe.

In order to extract $$\infty$$ from the finite, a restriction or containment, is necessary. {NOTE: Called _Din_ in Kabbalah.} (see piece on &empty; and '{}' in set theory.) This is the primal duality, created by a wall that exists between the finite and the infinite.

What does this wall look like? What are its characteristics. If the wall itself is not infinite, then how can it exist in a finite realm? And the inverse is true. It is certainly true to question how it exists in realm of the Infinity of Infinities, where everything is, by definition, infinite.
Thus the primal separation is the emergence of the finite from the infinite. And so it is. For as finite beings everything we experience is finite. Yet we dream of the infinite, though never attaining a real "experience" of it. If everything we imagine exists, then infinity must exist too.

Math is like a measuring too. It describes events that have already occurred. It measures effects that already exists. And upon that collection of data, projects predictions, formed on the patterns already measured, based on the data collected. The requirement of "demonstrable proof" holds us in our patterns of the past. If it has been "proven", then it cannot emerge as something else, for that would be breaking the very foundation upon which this system of knowledge is based. There is no place for the miraculous, for the mystery to be perceived.
