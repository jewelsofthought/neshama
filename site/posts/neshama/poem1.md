# Ego separates

- Ego separates, spirit seeks union
- Ego is static, spirit is dynamic, always in motion.
  Like form and force.
- Breath is air in motion,
  breath of the Divine is the motion.

```
Something moves in spirit, a need to enter the sacred path of union:
Union with the Beloved occurs in the upper realms,
Union with another occurs in the middle realms,
And finally, sexual union is fed from the lower realm.

Yet it is the space from which life emerges.

Oh, simple being,
you are called to the darkness,
for there you find life.
Not another alone,
but your own.

Only in the depths of existence,
Yours, can you find the Source.
For G-d remains hidden
in plain sight.
We just have to learn to
see.

Sometimes the path awaits, and
like a lightning bolt, descends
upon you, and you awaken (or not).

Most times we trudge, step by step,
day by day, moment by moment, searching,
hoping, praying, calling, braying
like lost sheep.

Then, for those who can be quiet,
in the precious moments of peace,
perhaps the Voice is heard - for ears
do not have to be taught to hear,
like eyes to see.

It is a Siren call - full of life
and lust. You have to follow it -
and it will always lead you to sin
where you are blessed to with the sacred gift
of choice...

Choose the darkness, and it will with remain with you
until you are worthy or "[lucky](mazal.html)" to be blessed again.

Choose the light, and it will remain with you,
as long as you are humble.

```
