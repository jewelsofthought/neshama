## Pieces

> If richer and fuller languages for redemption are to evolve, fantasies that fetishise the past must be relinquished

> Each organ is a recording and playback mechanism, blood is the recording tape with metal filings, cells are the components that make up the living crystals, and bones are the crystallisation of this information.

> In order for there to be an outcome, the laws of symmetry must be broken.

> Just as we wake in the morning hungry for food to nourish our bodies, do we need to awaken with the same spiritual hunger to sustain our souls.

> "Nothing left to lose" implies that you had something to lose and then were placed&mdash;or forced&mdash; into having nothing left to lose.

> To live a "big" life takes "big" energy, not only from you, but from your environment. Think of moving a skateboard 1km, versus a car, or an 18-wheeler...

## Thorn in your side

A third approach sees the suffering associated with sin as the by-product of G-d's rehabilitation of the iniquitous soul. The analogy is the removal of an infectious splinter from a person's body: the pain that is experienced is not a "punishment" as such for the person's carelessness, but an inevitable part of the healing process itself. The fact that a foreign body has become embedded in living flesh and has caused its decay makes its removal a painful experience. By the same token, when something alien to the soul's bond with G-d has become embedded within it, the extraction of this alien body, and the healing of the bond, is experienced as painful to both body and soul.

## Sleep

> "When a person climbs into bed, his soul leaves him..." (Tishby, _Wisdom of the Zohar_, 1:121b, note 8, p203)

> "This soul fills the body, and when a person sleeps she ascends, drawing down life from above" - R' Me'ir (Tishby, _Wisdom of the Zohar_, 2:809-12)

The abundance of the earth is in all. "All" designates _Yesod_, who transmits the entire flow of emanation to _Shekhinah_, symbolised by the earth&mdash;and through Her to the worlds below. So it is with the energy of life.

## Vayetzi

> During the growing phase , your gift is your tool. If it becomes a weapon, then you will live by the rule of the sword.

> Eldership is attained/ordained when you gain the wisdom of your gift. Which is expressed in gratitude: "I have been granted my portion." That is "I have been blessed with the gift of ...".

## To be religious

To be religious means to have an intuitive feeling of the unity of everything (that is **HaShem**). G-d is the name we give to this unity. And so we gather around the call of the _Shma_, just as the people were called by the _shofar_ in times of old.

He did not wish to bewail his situation for he knew that the intrinsic problem was with his relationship with himself.

Though, it must be said, that he was becoming emotionally bankrupt. Where he was driven by his addictions, all of which had control over him. How sad! The road to ... self-destruction. He could not possibly succeed on this path. He knew the answer to his quandary too. It would require embarking on the path of healing. The only thing holding him back was his perception of their finances.

It has been so long since he had achieved anything meaningful. Anything he could look back at and be proud of.

The extent to which you wish to give to the Creator, will be the extent to which you gain satisfaction with what you do.

[Well, know that beyond that point lies infinity. Remember, that no matter how far you go, just beyond is the zone wherein you will find the infinite in all its glory.](#well-know-that-beyond-that-point-lies-infinity-remember-that-no-matter-how-far-you-go-just-beyond-is-the-zone-wherein-you-will-find-the-infinite-in-all-its-glory) 8.

We’re really losing it. The symbol of a raised hand, nails manicured to perfection. White, soft holding a small, almost heart-shaped device, with a small space at the bottom, and a flattened top. It has a small, square screen in the middle. It is “the no-fuss mobile Info” device. When you are in the city, you can get a list of restaurants, directions, and events around the city… what happened to spontaneity? We will not have to talk to people to get directions anymore. Will the experience be enhanced, as technology always claims?

It is as if we have become fascinated with our own magic. And it is magical, the life we live. Talking to one another over long distances. Watching pictorial and aural representations projected over huge areas and distances, making a kind of ritual out of it. For we can all experience the same moments through the commonality of TV. It is similar to the Passover ritual for the Jews, where there are millions of people all over the world, who will be celebrating the same event, in very similar ways, reading the same story, eating similar food. Investigating the outer and inner reaches of the universe we are aware of, with tools and mechanisms, which only the high priests of science can understand.

The rest of us, are just recipients of their vision. And live like rats in a cage that the Lords of Society have fashioned for us to be experimented upon. Our consciousness has been turned upon ourselves, and we are not aware of the society we are fashioning. For it is no longer a singular absolute decision that we can make, but one that will affect every part of the system. This is what our high priests are reporting back to us.

The same burning desire to understand the world around us. The same willingness to sacrifice everything, even themselves to understand it. In the same fashion, did the witchdoctors and priests of yore explore. And so did the rest of us listen, as we are listening now. Always with the distraction of the one’s hungry for power. The Dark Lords that tempt us, and project and reflect our own darkness, our own hunger to fulfil our every desire, even the darkest. The ones who live the life we fantasize about, so we produce the blessed ones of our desire to be recognized. Here, it is even more important to separate the _Yetzer Ha’Rah_ from the _Yetzer Ha’Tov_, the good from the evil. There is a huge difference is there not between a famous movie star and an infamous psychopath, whether a sanctioned or unsanctioned killer – though both are expressions of our dark side.

## 1 and -1, good and evil

Think of it as a graph, where zero is neutral, 1 is absolute good, -1 is absolute evil. Then there is a huge difference between approaching zero and approaching –1. We now know that a better way to look at it is as a body in motion. Thus we can use calculus. The differential equations will show us the direction we are heading, and the integral equations will show us what space we are filling and how, i.e. what we are putting out.

Thus we can work out whether we are heading towards –1, 0 (from –1), 1, or 0 (from 1). In this way, we have a basic set of elements here, manifesting the four directions:

- Going from 0 to –1, you are entering the danger zone, and moving towards becoming truly evil. Evil actions are now becoming commonplace in your existence. Either you are becoming a killer, a rapist or a victimizer – one who perpetrates violence and cruelty on others.
- Going from –1 to 0, you are still in the danger zone, but something has begun to change you, has awoken the _Yetzer Ha’Tov_ and you are becoming aware, once again (for you knew you were descending once upon a time), of the need to change for the better – the basic human instinct. It is almost always love. Perhaps the birth of a child. Perhaps an experience of the beauty of someone or something around you. Perhaps the love or kindness of a stranger. Perhaps a piece of music. Or perhaps Adonai took pity on you, and woke the sleeping spirit, and you loved him forever more.
- Often it is a “bottoming out”, reaching your endpoint, your -1. Realising that whatever downward spiral you had reached, it was time to change something in your life, and you had arrived at that turning point, that place where you would be willing to do anything, whatever sacrifices it entailed, to change that in yourself.
- Going from 0 – 1. You are becoming blessed. I suppose as you approach the 1, (or is it after you pass through the origin, the 0 point); you will be able to begin to bless others, to spread the kindness and love. You are on the path to redemption. You are climbing Jacob’s ladder. Moving from the Earth to Heaven. Beauty and kindness and love will begin to surround you. People and animals will be naturally drawn to you, and want to spend time in your sphere. These are the ones to follow and emulate. Only you have to be in the right field of existence to be able to find them, for they do not advertise.
  This is also called the road to redemption. The _“chozer be’tsuvah”_, the returnee. The one who fell into sin, but emerged from it, having passed through the dark night of the soul.
- Going from 1 – 0. That is a sad journey. It is the fall. Satan falling from being God’s favourite to being his Archenemy. The prosecutor – always pointing out the Bad, feeding the _Yetzer Ha’Rah_. What a victory, to bring down one of the Blessed. It is Adam’s eviction from the Garden of Eden. It is childhood – born an Angel, and living in Elohim’s blessed womb. Growing into the world and encountering the Dark side.
  It is also the beginning of the story, where the 1, the unity, the everything, splits into emergence, and as such has to reach the 0 point, middle, in order to be able to extend outwards.

There is an interesting concept that emerges here. In order to attain the 0 point, in the middle, the 1 would have to create the -1 so that the 0 would be in the middle‼!

Then we have the integral, which investigates the space of the journey, and talks of the actions that you perpetrate and the manner in which you carry out these actions.

It is not the fact that they are collecting information about us. It is the intention behind the collecting of information, the purpose behind the action. (This is another example of the differential/integral model. The direction is the collection of information. The use of that information is the integral function.)

The reason they want all this information, is not to help you (that is a side effect of the main purpose. If they do help you, then they may get your business, for their service or product becomes a perceived value add.), but to make a profit. Here is where we become the rats in the cage, our only purpose in life, as perceived by the marketeers, is to benefit their company and make them rich and profitable. For that is the ultimate purpose of existence as defined by this culture. The US having brought this motif to the level of an art form, using all the science and technology that they can muster.

This has to change to be used for the benefit of us all. To track and monitor our habits desires and needs. Our purpose in life should be to ensure that we all have the means with which to express these desires and fulfil our needs, hopefully in a positive and constructive manner. Though if our ethic has changed to be one of aiding one another to achieve this, and we are rewarded appropriately, so that it becomes worth our while, and we receive the recognition that all of us yearn for, I think we will begin to see less and less incidents of destructive and non-productive behavior patterns.

For example, there is a group in New York City of organic farmers that began to give out free fresh fruit and vegetables in the poverty stricken areas of the 5 boroughs. By feeding the people, and eventually providing them with work, the crime rate in the area dropped, to the level that the city noticed, and began to support them financially, and use the police to help them distribute the food. Apparently, now that the people did not have to deal in drugs to feed their family, they stopped doing so. Also, now that the kids saw that there were other ways of earning a living, besides drug dealing, which was the only way of getting ahead in the ghetto, they began to take to it.

## Red Toyota

You turned in front of me, driving in the red Toyota 4-runner, and I thought you were pretty. For a while I was behind you, and noticed how you were tailgating. That got my goat, and gave me an extra incentive to see if you were as attractive as I imagined. Eventually I had the chance to pull into the lane next to you, and passed you. I glanced up as we drew adjacent, and you were lovely. Now it all changes of course. A couple more times we were next to one another. Once we were even waiting at the light, and I had plenty opportunity to surreptitiously take in your loveliness. You were young, though not too young, mid-twenties I would guess. Short blonde hair, pageboy style. You, of course, never glanced my way. The final parting occurred when you pulled into the turn lane, and we waited together at the light. It turned green, and I was looking at you, one last look. You turned and looked at me, and there was a smile on your lips! I was taken aback.

I am afraid to lose control. And lovely women make me feel weak and not in control. My affirmation is to enjoy the journey.

## Labour

We have made a commodity of labour, separating the person’s labour from the person. Thus we can quantify the labour, refer to it as a labour “force”, and use it, separately from the life of the person.

This is in order to quantize a person’s labour, and thus put him in a profit making context, instead of a human one.

In the same way we have commodified play and leisure.

## Negative agenda

The problem is that the movement is at its essence negative. It spends its time criticizing the present paradigm, instead of help building and leading it to a new, positive expression of the old one.

The problem with the aristocracy is that it is not expressing the truth of their desires. When you are rich and have the power and there is a whole slew of society that is in poverty, would you not want to be able to own such a toy?

## Co-create

It is about being taught that we can create our own world, our own environment. That is the freedom we all seek. The tribal directive tells us that we should all live the world within a certain framework, and that it is impossible to live without that framework, and be happy, or fulfilled or go to heaven, otherwise.

So, starting off as kids, where we are taught to accept the edicts handed down to us from above, whether it is by our parents, our teachers, or by any other adults. So we are born with others who have authority over us, and then we grow up to have the ultimate authority, in the name of God and his minions, describing the framework within which we are allowed to work.

Thus the ultimate cage. That of the one that is defined by God, and then handed down to us by Man. We often forget that this is just a Human interpretation of the Will of the God, the Unknowable. It is fortified by the mythos that surrounds the enlightened one’s, Allah, Buddha, Mohammed, to name a few. For they, being human like us, are also supposed to be Divine.

Now, there are two attitudes that emerge from this.

The first is that they are better, or different, than us. They are “special”. That is an attitude that fortifies the division between us. That there are those who are “special” and different, and thus deserve their differing status is life –the aristocracy, the wealthy, or even the prophets.

Then there is the more enlightened view, which states that if they are indeed human, then they are much the same as any of us. Thus, any and all of us, have the potential to become enlightened like any of them, and thus by the same token we carry the divine seed in each of us too.

Now, going back to the framework, it is an incredible testament to the creativity that we can achieve and accomplish so much within this limited structure. For, as we know, this structure, handed down to us in another human – and thus limited - interpretation. As we know, if the underlying framework is Divine, that is, part of the infinite One that is all we know and more, then the framework is essentially infinite in all directions, therefore anything’s possible.

## Human being

Human, being the Divine and the human. Look at human as the limited side of our being (sometimes referred to as the ego). The Divine is the infinite side of our being. We can tell the difference between the two, by being aware of whether we are expressing the infinite side of our beings, or whether we are coming from the limited, part. The words that I associate with limited are fearful, belief in the Bad, restricting potential. The ones that are used with the infinite Divine are perhaps Love. From here we go to the next step, which is that this can only be expressed through our Love of God, the Divine. For if love is:

That is the similarity between Christians and Moslems. They each love the Son of God and the Prophet of Allah – not God or Allah, himself. This is the essential difference between these religions and Judaism. Now loving Jesus, Son of God, our Lord and Saviour, we do come to the cult of the divine human – for that is what Mohammed, Prophet of Allah, Blessed be His Name, We could continue here to look at the being that we are lauding, as a special being – the Son of God - for instance. Although Jesus did say we are all like Him too, did he not? So we end up with again with the doctrine of the divine human. Now the distinction here is that some of us are divine. However, the age of enlightenment of our society must be realisation that we are all divine. In fact, everything is divine, for everything comes from the Creator, Blessed be his Name, and everything contains an atom of His Energy. In fact, no Atom could Exist without His Hand in it. No Molecule can Form without His Blessing. And the conclusion of the conscious man is if you cannot see the Divine in something, it is only because of your blindness, and fear, and lack of love of the Energy that has Created us all.

Our eternal pain is not that we are bad (as the site of the eternal battle between ערה רצ׳, the will to evil, and בותה רצ׳, the will to Good), but that the will to evil might be residing within us. If we consider ourselves co-creators, in constant interaction with the Divine, we have to accept the fact that we have the Evil Urge imbibed in our very cores. This is where the doctrine of forgiveness becomes so necessary, so healing. It states that we start our healing from the place of forgiving ourselves for being aware of Evil. For if we are part of the creation, then we are creating evil in the world just by thinking about it, even if only for a moment.

Does this feed our evil sides in any way? By the acknowledgement of evil, we are in some way, creating it, giving it energy. On the other hand if we cannot admit that we have the urge to evil in our beings, then how can we ever forgive ourselves, and heal? For what is there to forgive? If we do not even admit to the urge existing within ourselves.

How can we enjoy ourselves without being bad? If God is all loving and does not care what we do, just that we love her, then how come we need to accept all these other rules that have been made, that make us so unhappy. So unhappy as to have the need to kill one another, and often in the name of the self-same god of love and peace and harmony.
If you are expected to uncritically accept something, then it is very likely that you are being force-fed a line of mysticism and superstition whose sole aim is to defraud you, possibly humiliate you and, in rare occurrences, cause harm to you. You are being asked to believe -- in the absence of all evidence -- that what some stranger is telling you is the truth just because that person says so.

## Back in "real" space

4/13/02

It is painful to be back in my “real” space. We enter into a state of bliss, a place of unconditional love, of non-judgmental relationships, and then we return, as if from outer space to the dependencies and dependents, the enabling and the co-dependent relationships; the loves that manifest in the material – as of daughter, of husband, of lover and love, of Father, of friend – with all their limitations and expectations, and slowly we emerge from the fog and the harsh light of the day is removes all the shadows, all the soft places.

How come this bliss is not manifest inside me, in my life and my love.
They see how powerful someone or some nation is and they aspire to obtain some of this power. This is the dynamic of those that desire power. So they will cater to those that have the power. So eventually one has a concentration of power (and money) in the hands of an elite and a larger and larger segment of the population being disempowered. Now because this elite has a large share of the power, they can influence such things as the information flow, and thus public opinion and actions.

## Bureaucratic institutions

ToL: 2001 8:10 AM

It seems that in large bureaucratic institutions there is no culpability. Or rather, it seems a fact of life that there when the amount of people participating in an organized structure reaches a specific threshold, the actions of the structure become somewhat removed from the reality or consequences of their actions.

In order to effect change, one has to find those responsible for the issue in question. How does one even go about that? Once one has found this person or people, if you raise the issue, you will always get a lot of justifications as to why it is that way. For there is always a way for us to justify almost any action depending on the circumstances. The proof of that is in the history of all that has happened already.

## High, then low

Neshama: 5/1/2001 9:32 AM

After the high, comes the low.

Flowing with you all, dancing, meeting, journeying, touching and being touched,
I return to my life changed, as always after being touched, and long for some more.
To spend my life dancing for and with the spirits, to be communicating with them, and
Help deliver their teachings and love to us all – is my dream.

## Judaica

1/10/2002 10:54 AM
Parshas Va'era
Yechezkel 28:25

This week's _haftorah_ teaches us a profound lesson in arrogance and self
dependency. **HaShem** instructed the prophet Yechezkel to deliver a crushing blow to Pharaoh and his Egyptian empire and predict its total destruction.

**HaShem** said, "Behold I am sending the sword after you that will decimate
man and animal. Egypt will lay desolate and ruined....in response to your
saying, 'The river is mine and I developed it.'" (29:8,9) **HaShem** held
Pharaoh and Egypt fully accountable for their arrogant approach to
prosperity crediting their sustenance solely to their technology.

The above lesson reminds us never to forget our limited role in our
personal success. We must never forget that **HaShem** is our true provider and He develops and secures our efforts with their ultimate success.

## Sexual Energy

Neshama: m&f

Thoughts on why we need a sacred ritual to focus the sexual energy that the feminine is the recipient of:

The masculine collects all this sexual-creative energy that needs to be made manifest. For his direction is transformation from the spiritual to the material – from the crown chakra down to the sexual chakra, from _Keter_ to _Shekhinah_. The feminine, the receptive, awaits this energy to enter into her and she is the medium in which the spiritual is made manifest. So, sexually, she accepts the gifting of the masculine into her very being. What should emerge from this is a child, but now when we have sex for other reasons, the creative energy will need to find another outlet. This often manifests in possessive emotional energy. She needs to be able to move the energy from the material to the spiritual. This is why we need the sacred ritual. The Kundalini snake that will unwind the energy from the base of the spine into the heavens.

## Male/female dynamics

Thoughts on nutrient absorption being a metaphor for male/female dynamics, or why we believe in the perfect partner...

The cell needs certain nutrients. It creates a protein receptor, a huge, macro-molecule, which then emerges from the cell wall. Its roots in the primal fluid within which the cell lives, its head in the universal fluid that surrounds the cell. There it waits, a receptor, listening to all the sounds, all the calls, all the music of the spheres that surrounds it. It gets enchanted sometime. But if it is healthy, and in alignment, it will recognize the sign it is listening for, and then it will morph, and change itself, to begin to send out the vibrational energy to pull this nutrient into it’s being. It does not know from anything except the musical vibrations whether it will fit or not. Assuming, balance and perfection, it will fit like a glove to a hand, the key that opens up the doorway to the core of the cell. There it will be consumed and in it’s giving aid the cell in its life and journey. It is why the masculine seeks annihilation, for through that there is transformation. And the creative journey is one of annihilation, transformation and creation.

A moment on the cell that is a little of center – emotionally, or otherwise, then the protein will accept a substitute, perhaps something that is close, and bring it in. This will provide some nutrition, but there will be a side effect. Thus you will need more than is healthy of this nutrient, you will have an allergic reaction to it, or it will hurt you.

So, this is why I end up putting these messages into Word.

## Infinity

> “What is to give light must endure burning.” (Viktor Frankl)

Intense thoughts about infinity in the last couple of days.

What is infinity? What do you think it is? How would you describe it? I am thinking about it in particular as a defining characteristic of the Divine. Remember too we are talking about The Divine Infinity – which means infinity in every and all directions at every moment.

&nbsp;&nbsp; \* \* \*

Now, choose a point in your consciousness. See it. Feel it. Hold it. Make it your centre. Now, holding that take that point, let it begin moving away from you - in any direction. As any direction you choose is right.

Holding your place and move with the point as well, expanding with it. Stay with this feeling for a while. Now lets continue moving further and further with it.

Remember, you have not moved – just your awareness, expanding to encompass this point and holding the original center.

Looking at this point, you will notice that it has defined a line from its origin to where it is presently. See how your consciousness can traverse that line, and all the points in between. Explore this a moment. Play with it. Watch it undulate, breath, hold itself. Watch it pulsate, for it has to have energy to exist.

Enough for now. Let us continue on our journey to infinity. The point is continuing to move, further and further. Now it is moving faster and faster, whizzing out further than ever before. Stretch, stretch with it. Keep the line. Keep the information and energy flowing. Is there something infinite in you that can keep going, or do you have to stop?

Well, know that beyond that point lies infinity. Remember, that no matter how far you go, just beyond is the zone wherein you will find the infinite in all its glory.

I am not sure whether you said you liked physics or not. But perhaps this will help.

When we see how many absolute miracles of fine-tuning were necessary for a universe and sentient beings to manifest, it becomes a semantic quibble whether you invoke “the laws of physics” or “God”, because they share the same divine powers of manifestation

“The probability that the electron (unit of energy)---always viewed as a particle through and through---arrives at any chosen point on the screen is built up from the combined effort of every possible way of getting there.”

Yet, in our consciousness, it arrives at a certain place, we think. So, is it just our consciousness that is focusing on that particular place and thus it manifests in our reality? Thus at every moment we live in a universe of infinite possibilities, in fact the universe itself is living every possible occurrence at every moment, yet we traverse one path according to what we experience at that moment – according to what we are able to correlate.

This is known as Feynman’s “sum-over-paths” approach to quantum mechanics.

According to this theory, particles must be viewed as travelling from one location to another along every possible path. So, at every moment there are an infinite number of paths that are going to be traversed.

Then I read these pieces in an interview with Timothy Conway “On Engaged Spirituality” from The Sun Issue 328 Apr 2003.

From the mystical point of view, we are being challenged to question the illusion of our egos and awaken from the dream of “me” to our true identity as Divine Spirit.

“And what is going to lead us to that realization?”

Pain, anguish and a sense of absurdity or meaninglessness…. At a certain point, people feel life is so intolerable that they reject the traditional concept of an external “puppet master” deity. When God is up there and we’re down here, we’re under his thumb. As conditions worsen, this rather sadomasochistic view of the deity eventually becomes intolerable.

The mature panentheistic view says that G-d alone is. G-d plays all the parts in the phenomenal drama of existence. Like a single actor moving about onstage to create various characters, G-d is exploring all kinds of experiences: pleasure, pain, loneliness, popularity, fear, longing, resentment, euphoria. As some saintly Hasidic rabbis courageously stated, G-d is the Jewish families going off to the ovens in the concentration camps, and God is the Nazis sending them off to their deaths. God is the suffering Iraqi children dying of cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea because sanctions have deprived them of clean water and basic medicines, and G-d is the U.S. State Department and White House officials who keep the murderous sanctions in place. All are guises of the one God. God plays all possible roles---from the enlightened beings to the most unenlightened dictators and death squads. So many different possibilities (from Feynman we would say: All possibilities) --- and not just human, but also animal, plant, fungal and bacterial. All played by this one Spirit. This nondual view answers the problem of all creatures suffering at the whim of an almighty Creator who’s putting them through their paces. No! If you feel pain, this is G-d’s pain. God is here, finding out what it’s like to be “you”, experiencing this grievously troubled situation, just as G-d’s experiencing what it’s like to be George W. Bush, or Saddam Hussein, or a cancer patient, or someone who just won the Lotto. What an amazing play of divine creativity and courage and poignancy.

Engaged spirituality means spontaneously working for the collective welfare out of a deep sense of solidarity with all sentient beings… It’s basically radical empathy with “the other”, who at that point is no longer other, but a manifestation of the one Self, the nondual divine reality of Spirit..

“And all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.” And the beautiful secret of G-d was revealed to Juliana of Norwich, the great fourteenth century saint&mdash;that all beings would somehow be brought Home. No one would have to permanently suffer in hell, for G-d is our deepest truth, our real condition of eternal love and bliss. No creature can exile himself from his love forever.

## The dance

The dance today was different, in that I had a lot of support and affirmation from all the women in the group. Even the facilitator said that I was a wonderful dancer. This affirms my belief and feeling in the dance. I have been playing soccer and volleyball in lieu of my dancing. But I need to get back on the bandwagon.

Anyways during the dance today, while I was in trance, I suddenly got this picture of the women wanting me to continue. They were supporting me in what I am doing and want me to succeed to realise my potential. Each one thinks they want me, but as a whole, they want me to bridge between them and the male principle. A sacred male prostitute! A _kwitsat ha’derech_. I have to remain strong and true to my belief and principles. I see something and I need to offer it to us all.

## Chemical dependency

About the chemical dependency that is becoming endemic in our society, permeating every facet of it. Of the chemicals that are being foisted on us, in the name of progress, are they not just a thinly veiled means of control? For once you introduce a man-made chemical into the system, you gain some control of it.

This looks at the various “additives” introduced into our food, sugar, and sugar based products, and of course, last, but not least, money. Remember, money is also a drug.

An addendum to this is the fact that every emotion produces a chemical in the brain. So the thought is that as we become addicted to these chemicals, so we will re-create situations that will cause us to produce those particular chemicals.

## Global leadership

Harvard Business Review, Dec 2005. Regional Strategies for Global Leadership by Pankaj Ghemawat.

“It is often a mistake to set out to create a worldwide strategy. Better results come from strong regional strategies, brought together into a global whole.”

This is another concept of ToLNet.

I have not yet read the article, but the graph labelled “Intraregional Trade as a Percentage of Total Trade” on p101 from “United Nations: International Trade Statistics Yearbooks, 1958 to 2000.” was fascinating. Between 1958 and 2000, rising from 55% to about 65% for Europe, from 40% up to 60% for Americas, from about 37% to 48% for Asia, dropping from 60% to 20% for Eastern Europe and former USSR, with the Middle East and Africa hovering around 10%.

This says that Africa and the Middle East have inefficient regional economies. And the most effective way to empower the populace would be to strengthen these local economies. This graph shows that most of the wealth of the nation is being removed and not generating must wealth for the local economies. In the fashion of the TOL, the population needs to focus on their local needs and themselves to create the infrastructure to support this. If most of the money stays in the local economy, it will give it a strong base. If it is bringing in more money than is flowing out of it, then it will become a wealthy economy.

This is what shows as Americas’s pain. It is a disjoint, a disconnected culture. It abhors failure and thus requires “every man for himself”. A selfish narcissistic endeavour.

This makes me think that perhaps this is the way I see the universe. It is how I look at myself and my life.

## Mystic & Magic

Mystic, Mysticism and Magic – Joscelyn Godwin p148 – Johannes Kepler

“Laws of the solar system as derived from the five regular solids… was the result of divine law, interpreted not just as a geometrical but also as a mystical harmony..”

brought me to the following:

1. All laws, even those that are “scientific” are expressions of divine law. For instance, the laws of gravity, are Divine laws.
2. To look at one’s life in that manner, seeing that one is contained in surroundings filled with G-d’s laws. And that every action is a dialogue (a negotiation) with these Divine laws.
3. 3. That is how science co-opted religion so completely. Because these were mystics who penetrated the secrets of the universe, under the banner of science, and not under the banner of being mystics. They never for a moment thought that they were not penetrating the mind of G-d, which was, to their minds, a holy quest. So the “laws” that they “discovered” were accepted scientifically, and not mystically. Though, by the masses, they realised that they were actually mystical.

## Numbers

Friday, April 10, 2009

When dealing with numbers, we ask a couple of questions.

Our troubles begin when we try and place the numbers on a line. This introduces the concept of distance between say 5 and 6. It also introduces the concept of precedence, and thus an ordering, a greater and a lessor.
It is the transformation of the imaginative, the symbolic into the real. It is the movement from _Chochmah_ to _Binah_, from intellect to relation.
Dealing only in numbers, we have this set of symbols which were, once upon a time, auditory. Both spoken and now written. This is referred to as natural numbers – because there is something intuitive, something natural, about them.

The child needs to be taught the name and meaning of each symbol. This is the identification, the singular, One. Just as he needs to be taught the names of the objects around him – and of him as well. This is two, etc. Then, if he decides to relate to any of them, we have three. The first relationship. The possible birth. Continuing in this fashion, we have a bag of numbers.

Now choose to represent groups as numbers. Associate them with groups of things. One apple, ten oranges, etc. We know there is a difference, generally numeric, between them. Thus they stand in a value relationship with one another, this is the ordering.

When we delve into the meaning of these symbols, we encounter the numerology of Pythagoras, where numbers take on mystical and symbolic meanings – entering into realms other than the numerical. Jews worked on the correlation between numbers and words, and called it Gematria.
As soon as we can assign numbers to these objects, we can begin to measure things around us, and our surroundings. Thus arose geometry – measuring and describing our earthly (geo-) environment.

Combining the numbers, with the geometry, we produced the number line.

## Ego & Mind

The planets don't cause/influence/affect (thus making us passive recipients of their influence, something akin to a billiard ball theory of determinism)rather, there's much mirroring and interrelationship going on in the universe.

The ego and the mind also have their place, otherwise we would not able to put anything together, just that they tend to overinflate and conspire to control. They also have a purpose, a task to complete. David Hawkins...says that there is no cause and effect, things just happen anyway.

## Meaning of the <i>Merkabah</i>

Kabbalists called it the _Merkabah_, meaning "four-wheel chariot."
Actually, _Merkaba_ is a compilation of Egyptian words. All the component syllables are Egyptian words. _Mer_ means "place of ascending", _Ka_ is “spirit-soul” and _Ba_ is “earth-self”. You can see there is a connection here.

## Shamanic Power

We accumulate Shamanic Power by maintaining integrity.  Simply put, every time we make a decision that is different from the one that our spirit would have made, we splinter off a part of ourselves into a parallel reality.  The more splinters we have, the less focus and concentration, the less power to manifest directly.  The process of healing is the process of reclaiming the splinters.  There's a movie about this, "The One", about someone who reclaims his splinters through violence.  It's a ridiculous Hollywoodization of the process, but it demonstrates the game.  Brian Weiss's books do as well.
