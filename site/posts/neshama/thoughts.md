## Pieces

      If richer and fuller languages for redemption are to evolve, fantasies that fetishise the past must be relinquished

> Each organ is a recording and playback mechanism, blood is the recording tape with iron filings, bones are crystallisation of this information.

> In order for there to be an outcome, the laws of symmetry must be broken.

> Just as we wake in the morning hungry for food to nourish our bodies, do we need to awaken with the same spiritual hunger to sustain our souls.

> "Nothing left to lose" implies that you had something to lose and t hen were placed&mdash;or forced&mdash; into having nothing left to lose.

> To live a "big" life takes "big" energy, not only from you, but from your environment. Think of moving a skateboard 1km, versus a car, or an 18-wheeler...

## Thorn in your side

A third approach sees the suffering associated with sin as the by-product of G-d's rehabilitation of the iniquitous soul. The analogy is the removal of an infective splinter from a person's body: the pain that is experienced is not a "punishment" as such for the person's carelessness, but an inevitable part of the healing process itself. The fact that a foreign body has become embedded in living flesh and has caused its decay makes its removal a painful experience. By the same token, when something alien to the soul's bond with G-d has become embedded within it, the extraction of this alien body, and the healing of the bond, is experienced as painful to both body and soul.

## Sleep

Focusing on a more personal experience of life, I would like to ruminate a moment on sleep, in the context we have been discussing previously.

> "When a person climbs into bed, his soul leaves him... (_Tishby Wisdom of the Zohar_, 1:121b, note 8, p203)

> "This soul fills the body, and when a person sleeps she ascends, drawing down life from above' - R' Me'ir (_Tishby Wisdom of the Zohar_, 2:809-12)

As a result of human sin, _Shekhinah_ is enslaved to Lilith, the demonic feminine, channelling the flow of emanation to the demonic.

The abundance of the earth is in all. All designates Yesod, who transmits the entire flow of emanation to _Shekhinah_, symbolised by the earth&mdash;and through Her to the worlds below. So it is with the energy of life.

## Vayetzi

During the growing phase , your gift is your tool. If it becomes a weapon, then you will live by the rule of the sword.

Your eldership is obtained/received/ordained when you gain the wisdom of your gift. Which is expressed in gratitude: "I have been granted my portion." That is "I have been blessed with the gift of ...".

## To be religious

To be religious means to have an intuitive feeling of the unity of everything (that is Ha'Shem). G-d is the name we give to this unity. And so we gather around the call of the _Shma_, just as the people were called by the _shofar_ in times of old.
