## Thorn in your side

#sin{.tag}

Once could see the suffering associated with sin as the by-product of G-d's rehabilitation of the iniquitous soul. The analogy is the removal of an infectious splinter from a person's body: the pain that is experienced is not a "punishment" as such for the person's carelessness, but an inevitable part of the healing process itself. The fact that a foreign body has become embedded in living flesh and has caused its decay makes its removal a painful experience. By the same token, when something alien to the soul's bond with G-d has become embedded within it, the extraction of this alien body, and the healing of the bond, is experienced as painful to both body and soul.

## Human being

#human{.tag}

Human, between Heaven and Earth, the Upper and Lower,  the Divine and the human beast. Look at human side as the limited side of our being (sometimes referred to as the ego),  the Divine as the infinite side of our being. We can tell the difference between the two by being aware of whether we are expressing the infinite aspect of our beings, or whether we are coming from the limited part. The words that are associated with limited are fearful, belief in the Bad (stinking thinking), selfish, ungiving, restricting potential. The ones that are used with the infinite Divine are Love, charity, expansive, generous

In order to express the infinite aspects of our character, we must accept and believe in the infinite aspect of the universe itself. Once opening to that conception of the Creation in which we exist, will require a greater  From here we go to the next step, which is that this can only be expressed through our Love of God, the Divine. For if love is:

That is the similarity between Christians and Moslems. They each love the Son of God and the Prophet of Allah – not God or Allah, himself. This is the essential difference between these religions and Judaism. Now loving Jesus, Son of God, our Lord and Saviour, we do come to the cult of the divine human – for that is what Mohammed, Prophet of Allah, Blessed be His Name, We could continue here to look at the being that we are lauding, as a special being – the Son of God - for instance. Although Jesus did say we are all like Him too, did he not? So we end up with again with the doctrine of the divine human. Now the distinction here is that some of us are divine. However, the age of enlightenment of our society must be realisation that we are all divine. In fact, everything is divine, for everything is  from (of) the Creator, Blessed be his Name, and everything living is a spark of His Energy. In fact, no Atom could Exist without His Hand in it. No Molecule can Form without His Blessing. And the conclusion of the conscious man is if you cannot see the Divine in something, it is only because of your blindness, and fear, and lack of love of the All-encompassing Consciousness that has Created us all.

Our eternal pain is not that we are bad (as the site of the eternal battle  רצ’ ערה, the will to evil, and רצ’ בותה, the will to Good), but that the will to evil might be residing within us. If we consider ourselves co-creators, in constant interaction with the Divine, we have to accept the fact that we have the Evil Urge imbibed in our very cores. This is where the doctrine of forgiveness and redemption becomes so necessary, so healing. It states that we start our healing from the place of forgiving ourselves for being aware of Evil. For if we are part of the creation, then we are creating evil in the world just by thinking about it, even if only for a moment.

Does this feed our evil sides in any way? By the acknowledgement of evil, we are in some way, creating it, giving it energy. On the other hand if we cannot admit that we have the urge to evil in our very being, then how can we ever forgive ourselves, and heal? For what is there then to forgive -- if we cannot not even acknowledge the possibility of error in our own consciousness?

How can we enjoy ourselves without being bad? If God is all loving and does not care what we do, just that we love her, then how come we need to accept all these other rules that have been made, that make us so unhappy. So unhappy as to have the need to kill one another, and often in the name of the self-same god of love and peace and harmony.

If you are expected to uncritically accept something, then it is very likely that you are being force-fed a line of mysticism and superstition whose sole aim is to defraud you, possibly humiliate you and, in rare occurrences, cause harm to you. You are being asked to believe -- in the absence of all evidence -- that what some stranger is telling you is the truth just because that person says so.

## Back in "real" space (Neshama)

4/13/02{.is-hidden}

#neshama/bliss{.tag}

It is painful to be back in my "real" space. After experiencing a state of bliss, a place of unconditional love, of non-judgemental relationships, and then I return, as if from outer space to the dependencies and dependants, the enabling and the co-dependent relationships; the loves that manifest in the material – as of daughter, of husband, of lover and love, of Father, of friend – with all their limitations and expectations, and slowly  emerge from the mists of ecstasy into the harsh light of the day which lights all the shadows, all the soft places.

What is the path to manifesting this bliss fully  in my life and my love?

#poem {.tag}

**After the high, comes the low.**

Flowing with you all,
dancing, meeting, journeying,
touching and being touched,
I return to my life changed,
as always after being touched,
longing for some more.
To spend my life dancing
for and with the spirits,
to be communicating with them, and
Help deliver their teachings
and love to us all –
That is my dream.

## Sexual Energy

#m_f{.tag}

Thoughts on why we need a sacred ritual to focus the sexual energy that the feminine is the recipient of:

The masculine collects all this sexual-creative energy that needs to be made manifest. For his direction is transformation from the spiritual to the material – from the crown chakra down to the sexual chakra, from _Tiferet_ to the _Shekhinah_. The feminine, the receptive, awaits this energy to enter into her to become the medium through which the spiritual is made manifest. Physically, she accepts the gifting of the masculine into her very being. What should emerge from this is a child, but now when we have sex for other reasons, the creative energy will need to find another outlet. This often manifests in frustrated emotional energy for it is expressed when it moves from the physical through her, into the spiritual. This is the reason that their union needs to be a sacred ritual. In order to arouse the Kundalini that will wind the energy from the base of the spine into the heavens.

## Cell dynamics 

#health{.tag}

Thoughts on nutrient absorption being a metaphor for male/female dynamics, or why we believe in the perfect partner...

When the cell needs certain nutrients,  it forms a protein receptor -- a huge, macro-molecule -- which then merges with the cell wall. Its roots in the primal fluid within which the cell lives, its head in the universal fluid that surrounds the cell. There it waits, a receptor, listening to all the information,  all the sounds, all the music of the spheres that surrounds it. It is truly an enchanted realm, as each element floating in the waters that surround the cell sings its song, announcing its existence, with bells and whistles. The protein is a receiver -- and a transmitter -- but if it the cell is healthy, and in alignment, it will recognise the sign it is listening for, as all necessary information is contained in its song -- just as we have learnt to send information along electromagnetic pulses, like lasers. The mechanism of recognition is by the same spectral frequencies that our instruments use to recognise a specific element or molecule. 

Then the protein will send out the call for this nutrient, and, if it responds, begin to draw it into it's very being. It does not know from anything except the musical vibrations whether it will fit or not. Assuming, balance and perfection, it will fit like a glove to a hand, the key that opens up the doorway to the core of the cell. There it will be consumed/transformed, giving to the cell in its life and journey. 

It is why the masculine seeks annihilation, for through that there is transformation. And the creative journey is one of sacrifice, transformation and creation.

A moment on the cell that is a off-center – physically, emotionally, or otherwise, then the protein that has been manufactured, will accept a substitute, perhaps something that is close, but will, in addition, feed the imbalance. Thus this imbalance will become stronger, and exert a greater influence on your well-being.
## Infinite possibilities

#qkab 

I am not sure whether you said you liked physics or not. But perhaps this will help.

When we see how many absolute miracles of fine-tuning were necessary for a universe and sentient beings to manifest, it becomes a semantic quibble whether you invoke "the laws of physics" or "God", because they are expressing the protocols of manifestation

>[!note] "The probability that the electron (unit of energy)---always viewed as a particle through and through---arrives at any chosen point on the screen is built up from the combined effort of every possible way of getting there."

Thus at every moment we live in a universe of infinite possibilities, in fact the universe itself is living every possible occurrence at every moment, yet we traverse one path according to what we experience at that moment – according to what we are able to correlate.

>[!info] This is known as Feynman's "sum-over-paths" approach to quantum mechanics.

According to this theory, particles must be viewed as travelling from one location to another along every possible path. So, at every moment there are an infinite number of paths that are going to be traversed.

Yet, in our consciousness, it arrives at a certain place, we think. Or, is it just our consciousness that is focusing on that particular place and thus it manifests -- we perceive it -- in our reality? 

>[!warning] Remember, that we cannot perceive (even remotely) these "particles". Although we believe in their reality, because our Priests have told us it is so, and, accepting the truth of what they have uncovered, we speak of the "particle" nature of said energy.

### On Engaged Spirituality

#Oneness #exc


This is from an interview with Timothy Conway "On Engaged Spirituality" from The Sun, Issue 328, Apr. 2003.

From the mystical point of view, we are being challenged to question the illusion of our egos and awaken from the dream of "me" to our true identity as Divine Spirit.

"And what is going to lead us to that realisation?"

Pain, anguish and a sense of absurdity or meaninglessness…. At a certain point, people feel life is so intolerable that they reject the traditional concept of an external "puppet master" deity. When God is up there and we're down here, we're under his thumb. As conditions worsen, this rather sadomasochistic view of the deity eventually becomes intolerable. 

The mature panentheistic view says that G-d alone IS. G-d plays all the parts in the phenomenal drama of existence. Like a single actor moving about onstage to create various characters, G-d is exploring all kinds of experiences: pleasure, pain, loneliness, popularity, fear, longing, resentment, euphoria. As some saintly Hasidic rabbis courageously stated, G-d is the Jewish families going off to the ovens in the concentration camps, and God is the Nazis sending them off to their deaths. God is the suffering Iraqi children dying of cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea because sanctions have deprived them of clean water and basic medicines, and G-d is the U.S. State Department and White House officials who keep the murderous sanctions in place. All are guises of the one God. God plays all possible roles---from the enlightened beings to the most unenlightened dictators and death squads. So many different possibilities (from Feynman we would say: All possibilities) --- and not just human, but also animal, plant, fungal and bacterial. All played by this one Spirit. This non-dual view answers the problem of all creatures suffering at the whim of an almighty Creator who's putting them through their paces. No! If you feel pain, this is G-d's pain. God is here, finding out what it's like to be "you", experiencing this grievously troubled situation, just as G-d's experiencing what it's like to be George W. Bush, or Saddam Hussein, or a cancer patient, or someone who just won the Lotto. What an amazing play of divine creativity and courage and poignancy.

Engaged spirituality means spontaneously working for the collective welfare out of a deep sense of solidarity with all sentient beings… It's basically radical empathy with "the other", who at that point is no longer other, but a manifestation of the one Self, the non-dual divine reality of Spirit..

>[!note] We cannot live in that space - for it is a Divine space - and will always be reminded to return. It is like the golden thread that binds the soul to the body, and calls it back from the dream. But if we do not acknowledge that that is the foundation upon which we exist, we will forever be lost in the limbo of existence.
