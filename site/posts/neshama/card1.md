> If richer and fuller languages for redemption are to evolve, fantasies that fetishise the past must be relinquished

> Each organ is a recording and playback mechanism, blood is the recording tape with metal filings, cells are the components that make up the living crystals, and bones are the crystallisation of this information.

> In order for there to be an outcome, the laws of symmetry must be broken.

> Just as we wake in the morning hungry for food to nourish our bodies, so we need to awaken with the same spiritual hunger to sustain our souls.

> "Nothing left to lose" implies that you had something to lose and then were placed&mdash;or forced&mdash; into having nothing left to lose.

> To live a "big" life takes "big" energy, not only from you, but from your environment. Think of moving a skateboard 1km., versus a car, or an 18-wheeler..

> We don't look for a religion. I have a destination, and I will take the path that will best lead me to my destination, not taking into account the influential effects of my destiny.

> As the eyes and the ears, the nose and mouth, the heart, legs and arms of G-d having a human experience, this is where you can begin to embrace and embody the truth of your existence.

## All change can only happen via יהוה

> If **Ha'Shem** is the **Source of everything**, then true manifestation can only extend from this **Source**. Therefore we must direct any and all desire, any and all prayer, every request to **Ha'Shem** - for only **He** can cause real change to occur.

### Divine Desire

- Every object, everything that exists in the Universe is a manifestation of **Divine Desire**.

### Ego

> If we are meant to be servants of G-d, then our ego's cannot rule.

## Centre

> The centre is a position relative to the space of the containment.

And to some extent is defined according to the rules and mechanics of measurement.

## The truth

> The truth will set you free &mdash; to do good, or to do evil!

## Your Gift

> During the growing phase, your gift is your tool. If it becomes a weapon, then you will live by rule of the weapon.

## Eldership

> Eldership is attained/ordained when you gain the wisdom of your gift.

Which is expressed in gratitude: "I have been granted my portion." That is "I have been blessed with the gift of ...".

## Spiritual Gym

A spiritual gym is a place where you

- lift concepts heavier than you would normally
- carry a concept further than usual
- refine your techniques of exploration

## Spiritual Lab

A spiritual laboratory is where you carry out carefully crafted experiments to see what responds.

## Inner Shape

Many teach you about external movements, how to deal with outside forces. However, it is the inner shape that is most important. It is through the inner shape, that we experience the outer. Here we have choice in shaping the inner.

## Heaven

![card1.1](/posts/img/neshama/new/card1_fig1.1.png)

## Sex in Society

Society can only, and perhaps needs to, operate in a sexless environment. Once sex enters the picture, it introduces all the emotional trauma and baggage that a person (people) carry and their relationship with power and money.

This is an example of the connection between the internal and the external. The actual event, coitus, is not what affects the person long term, but the subjective, inner, experience of that act.

Even when coitus has not taken place, the influence of the sexual upon the behaviour of the people can still be significance. It can be exploited in many ways, both good and bad. If the ultimate goal of the usage is material it will result in perversion. If it is used for love, it will enhance all, especially all especially those who are in relationship with the participants&mdash;it is an act of love.

## Spiritual $$\leftrightarrow$$ Physical

If we are truly spirit then the physical world is a delusion, a projection, which we are constantly creating and maintaining. Thus our spiritual energy is dispersed in maintaining an illusion of ourselves that is incorrect.

The question then is whether you spend your energy in ensuing that your physical being&mdash;which is a delusion&mdash;is comfortable or in ensuring that your spiritual&mdash;where your true essence resides&mdash; being is nourished.

If it is the former, and all your spiritual energy is dissipated in material pursuits for the comfort of physical being, then it will diminish one's spiritual being until it will/may eventually be extinguished altogether.

## Birth

The impact of spirit entering the body, and encountering the constraining environment we are born into, is traumatic. This is what creates the spaces of forgetfulness, the places of cognitive dissonance. For how could such a limited space contain the full wisdom of Torah.

## Possesion

Is it possible for the soul of one person to "occupy" the body of another?

Most tales of possession speak of an entity, generally demonic, that takes possession of another. These encounters generally come from another realm. In order for this not to occur, you have to call to the Divine protection of your space and your creation&mdash;which is the body that your soul has "breathed life into". Remember how breath enters your body and the spreads and enters every cell of the body, so spiritually there is a breath or spirit, that vivifies every organ of the body.

We do have the choice whether to allow another power over us, whether to "give" one's power to another, or even more extremely, to a material goal or object&ndash;a drug, a woman, money, false idols, or some other form of material addiction. We are of an addictive nature, and need to direct, or constrain, our addictions appropriately. If we become addicted to positive things, like studying Torah (mental), worshipping G-d (emotional), practising random acts of kindness and chastity (physical) (_tzedakah_), that is the practice that we refer to as religion.

Mysticism, on the other hand, is a call to the unknown, by the unknown itself&mdash;which is referred to as the mystery itself. Through faith, the alchemy of the unknown, the dark, and mysterious, produces gold.

## Prayer

Come to terms with my .... nature. Emerge from the closet, so as to say. Live fully expressing the truth of who and what I am, in order to fulfil my purpose in service to my divine nature and my fellow humans.

To spread my wings and fly.

To be able to balance my masculine purpose and feminine desire for union.

To be free of the constraints of the programming of my past (ancestors). To release the constraints that prevent me from being who I really am and express the love and light of my inner being.

Focusing on joy in my life, letting G!d take me to the _shalom_.

## Darkness & Light

The darkness is inside. So whenever I am alone, I am in darkness. There is only light outside me. Thus when I are with others, I am in light (enlightened?).

Only when I am looking outside of myself, am I seeing light. Thus we conclude that outside is real because I can see it (see the light), whereas inside &ndash; where I cannot see what I am experiencing &ndash; is thus unreal.

## Choice

Assuming that we are faced with the choosing between a spiritual and a material option, if you choose the spiritual, then it is a spiritual path that you will embark upon. If, however, you choose the material option, it is a material path that you will find yourself upon. Both are filled with challenges and blessings, and both are valid. It is a life (existential) choice; and one can choose the other at any point. Though we say _choose_ the spiritual, and _fall into_ the material.

## Note on language

What has astounded me is the fascinating way in which language has developed. If one looks at these interesting coincidences, it becomes quite mysterious. For example, let's look at the two words _sacred_ and _scared_ in English.

Let's lay some groundwork. The consonants are the letters of form. In our case they are 'SCRD', which is the form of both _SaCReD_ and _SCaReD_. They cannot be expressed without the vowels which, in this case, are 'a' & 'e'. Vowels represent the feminine, and require the breath to be spoken, else they remain silent. 'A', the first letter of the alphabet, also represent the alpha, the divine.

_Sacred_ then has first the 'a', representing the _sacred_ and then the form 'C'. Whereas _scared_ first has the form, and then afterwards we have the divine represented by the 'A'. In the first, _sacred_, we place the divine before the form, whereas in the second, _scared_, we have placed the form before the divine. When we start with the divine we have 'creation' during which the 'creatures' were created. So we derive 'sacred creation' populated by 'scared creatures'.

- 'ED' is that part of the word that introduces the aspect of time.
- 'SCR' are root letters (consonants) and 'AE' are the vowels representing the feminine, breath & the divine.
- "C", a only hard consonant (the only one), comes before 'a' in scared, - 'a' comes after 's' in sacred.

So, the creature that accepts the Divine before form accepts the primacy of the sacred, whereas the one that believes that the form is primary, will be scared.

## Aberrant behaviour

All aberrant behaviour occurs due to an "unnatural", excessive or unnecessary constraint that has been imposed on the system &mdash; which is the exclusive abode of human existence. It begins with a disconnect, an acknowledgement of a separation.

&nbsp;&nbsp &mdash; R' Y"mba.

## Topology

If one is of a specific shape, then that defines one's topology which will define a certain relationship with the world around one.

## Ultimate Good

> The Supernal rests only on what is surrendered to him.

This is an expression of the ultimate Good of the Divine. For Good will always give us a choice. Thus G-d does not force us to experience Him. Yes, it is true, that we reap our karmic rewards according to our actions, but one could say that that is inherent in the system. It is an expression of the very laws, whether physical or spiritual, that are the dynamics of the very experience (Universe) that we exist in.

## Faith

> Where knowledge ends, faith begins.

It is through faith which transcends comprehension that one can feel true closeness to G-d.

> Inasmuch as my intelligence and the root of my soul are of too limited a capacity to constitute a "chariot" or abode for His blessed Unity in Perfect Truth. Since my mind cannot conceive nor apprehend Him with any degree of certainty in the world, nor even one iota of that of the Prophets and the Patriarchs.

What is faith then? It is the believe/knowledge that we are only a small part of the greater whole, and that what constitutes the totality is far greater than anything I can imagine. Thus life consists of an exploration into this great mystery.

> “We know that human vision assimilates only a small fragment of the spectrum; as far as our senses are concerned, the rest of it does not exist.”
> &mdash; Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz

It is more than likely that as far as all our senses are concerned, the rest does not exist. We cannot know what we don't know; we cannot comprehend the incomprehensible. And most of us have a survival mechanism, that keeps us safe in what we know, and is very reluctant to experience the unknown&mdash;a dark and terrifying place, filled with all sorts of monsters that we do may not be able to handle. Besides, it might cause a complete reassessment of the current life experience that you are going through.

> The process reality of being is beyond our cognitive reach (Henry Bergson)

Meditation that does not lead to clarification of commitment & action is entirely insufficient.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;

## Love

> Love what you have. You can only desire what you don't have. (Therefore love is not desire!)

Hate what you have, then you will love something that you don't have. That which represents the counter to that which you have.

## Snake

The tree is a snake entity that emerges out of the background of the Tree of Life.

## Context

Abulafia could not speak of it other than in the context within which they were all steeped (both him and his audience). Just as a mathematician can only use mathematics to express what he sees, so the Rabbi's could only speak in the language of their teachers.

## Perception

All perception takes place in a straight line between the recipient and perceived source of the event. Does the response have to be straight line as well? Would that be the simplest and most direct. But is it the best?

## Evolution

> You can only be freed by someone/something from the outside.
> You can only be freed by someone/something that is itself free!

- Revolution: if it is from the inside, it will only produce another version of what was. Often the same design. Even the same inmates &ndash; just a different location, and perhaps guards/wardens with different faces.
- Evolution: All evolution occurs due to outside force(s). However its disruptive effect is relative to the inner coherence/harmony of the body/society that is evolving/changing.
- All evolution is built on the previous iteration, and
- there are always those left behind [Noah's Ark](noah_ark.html)
  More accurately, every higher order of magnitude contains within it every lower order of magnitude as well (simultaneously).

## Here & now

- Absolute: here & now

The only absolute is that you are here, and aware. This "point" of awareness we call "Now". And the place that you experience it, is called "Here".

Even though the "now" of your experience is not simultaneous with the Now of the occurrence. It has to become the anchor upon which your life is tethered.

- Relative: past & future

The past is like sight. Depending on the perspective/the line upon which you gaze, you will see your past &ndash; which is the only real past you know. All the rest, that we call history, are narratives (generally told by the victors) and guesses as to what actually occurred. But the only true experience you have of the past, is those you have had, that you have lived.

And those experiences morph and change as time goes by, till they become vague discordant memories of a time long gone.

- Absolute/Relative

To know, to experience, to perceive of something as relative, there needs to be an absolute frame of reference. Even if that frame is relative to some greater system, it becomes the "absolute", fixed point of reference. The Axis around which your whole world turns. In order to change my life I have to change this [Axis Mundi](axis_mundi.html) (the central pillar) upon which my whole life stands.

This is like the compass which needs one fixed foot in order know where the other is directed.

## Pleasing the Creator

Bestow להנאת הבורה - for the delight of the Creator. Same as a parent/child relationship; or perhaps a teacher/student; or, best, a mentor & a novice.

Think of the first time a child "gives" something to its parent. How the parent delights in that gift. Whether it is the smile of a baby, or the scribbles of a young child, most parents value it for years. Think of a student that passes his grades, how proud is the teacher. Or a novice that understands the teachings, and the teacher knows that he is on the right path. So it for our Lord and Master, the Shepherd that bore us.

It seems that the constraint that holds most of us, is around our lack of giving towards our parents, and thus our ancestors - upon whose shoulders we stand. We seem to lack in compassion and forgiveness even for those who bore us, and sustained us, until we were able to make our own decisions (even the bad ones). We have forgotten about [honour](honour.html), and respect and decency - which implies, nay requires, some sort of code or covenant. In the same way, and I think this is the root cause of much of our disease &mdash; we no longer pay respect to our Creator. Like spoilt children, we even resent what we have been provided, always looking at and desiring, what we don't have &mdash; but seldom taking responsibility for the mess we ourselves have engendered.

Shamanically: "Magic of their Alchemical Union". Not personal. Shitty parents. Need to enter spirit, connect to your soul-purpose. As nothing can come into being without spirit, which working through each one of us, enabled us to manifest. It is all spirit. Do not be lulled into thinking it is literal, material or empirical &mdash; imagining that you are the real deal, the full package. That is foolish. There is so much more than you in this world...

## Devotion

Devotion consists of:

- Prayer (words)
- Movement (dance)
- Music (sound)

## Mercy

> Free choice as a turning away

The image from the _Zohar_ is of G-d turning His Eyes away, showing the whites of His Eye/I, in order to allow us to be human. In this picture, He Acts like a true lover, giving you the opportunity to reject Him (or Her).

Oh the joy when you choose Her. The righteous abundance that is showered upon you. The service that is required and the awesome, miraculous tasks that are laid before me. Thank you, my Guardian. Not measured in riches of this world, but riches of another that are worth far more in this world than any jewel or other earthly artifact.

## Free will

Why is following the Torah so onerous for so many? If it is indeed the blueprint of Creation, is this blueprint so flimsy, so delicately put together? If _Ha’Shem_ is omnipotent, why is there so much difficulty in following his commands? Why do we have to be cajoled and threatened, into obeying His Holy Word? Would we not, especially those who have seen His miracle, just follow them naturally?

Is it because we have been granted some of the Divine essence, or power, that we call “free will”.

However, this free will can only be expressed as a negative – that is to go against the “Will of G-d”.

To have any choice in the realm of the omnipotent perfection, I would have to have the ability to negate the existence of such omnipotence—a contradiction in itself. Perhaps the only way to express this is through taking a position of against the existence of G-d, declaring myself part of the tribe whose structure is build around the belief that there is No G-d. This attitude becomes an action in the world and the members build a system around this core belief, explaining the universe and our world in terms of this belief. This line of thinking always end up at question of the first cause, “In the beginning”, then speaks of a state or an unfolding of effects, but avoiding the question of how did the space and the configurations that make these effects possible, arise in the first place.

## Freedom

What is freedom truly?

Freedom to

- express yourself
- be yourself
- who you truly are
- realise your dreams (not phantasies)

[Q: Is freedom necessary in order to serve others?]

First, one has to learn who you are and for that we need..

> Freedom of constraint, constraint of freedom

## Superiority

A major motivation for religious endeavours, it seems, is the feeling of superiority that it engenders, and is, in many cases, encouraged. Thus humility has been a principle of all teachers of the mysteries. In fact is a requirement for anyone on the journey of authentic faith—and is one of the ways of separating one who has encountered the flame of truth, and one who claims to have, but has not.

## Spiritual foundation

A spiritual tradition that exists on a solid foundation, one that is based on a dynamic and spirited synthesis between the complimentary dynamics that oppose and the opposing dynamics that compliment one another. The process being one of thesis, antithesis and synthesis; declaration, opposition and resolution.

## Spiral in time

> Every journey is circular.

As we live and grow, the goal is to gain increased awareness of the immensity and complexity of the world we live in. However, Adam is only able to perceive it to whatever depth he is capable of.

The extent of his vision, depends on how far he can "throw" his dream body. If you can't even imagine it, how will you even be able to receive it. If you cannot envision another way, you will just work on more of the same, extending in a certain direction. This is breadth. It is horizontal expansion. How wide is your vision; how broad is your outlook; how large is yuor "sphere" of influence? {NOTE: Forming the circle - orthogonal, normal}

Length speaks of power, of will, of decisiveness. How far can the vision go. How much energy am I willing to invest in it? What is the length of the river, speaks also of how much water flows down it.

## M&F

![Symbol](/posts/img/neshama/symbol.svg)
This symbol is a representation of the principle of the dynamic of masculine and feminine.

It is similar to the principle of the polaroid lens, which blocks (or affects) the light on only one plane, either the horizontal or the vertical - orthogonal (at 90 degrees) to one another.

![Orthogonal](/posts/img/neshama/poloroid.svg)

In order to pass through this blockage, I need to align myself on of the two axes. Which means an alignment of the binary (2d) context that keeps us imprisoned in 3d.

What we derive from that, is that the dynamic between the masculine and the feminine - and thus, by derivation, between the male and the female - as in

![M <-> F](/posts/img/neshama/mf-opposing.svg)

But is actually orthogonal, as represented by: ![Symbol](/posts/img/neshama/symbol.svg)

## Messiahs

> There can be many messiahs, and many types of messiahs, but there can only be One G-d.

## Nature

> G-d speaks through the natural world. Nature is G-d speaking to us. Not G-d, but G-d's words!

> G-d as the expression of the natural universe. Idols are man made representations of said universe.

> The G-d I speak of is not man-made, but exists before the universe was created. In fact, G-d is the universe (and more). Thus we can say "G-d created the world."

> Most of us are spiritually uplifted by being in nature.

### Water

TODO: Man-made water versus natural, untainted water, and the probable effects thereof.{.note}

## Temple

Rise up and overcome the idol worshippers. Destroy their idols, not by blowing them up, but by starving them of attention. For there is no physical (or geographical) escape, like the Israelites did from Egypt in the story of the Exodus, which has exerted its influence on us throughout the ages. In other words, there is no more room for horizontal expansion. So the only other place to expand is vertically &mdash; and that would necessitate a deeper investigation and exploration of the "spiritual" or upper world(s). It will open up whole new spaces for us to explore. The only other alternative is for there to be a decimation of the population, thus making space for future geographic expansion!

<figure style="float: left">
  <img src="/posts/img/neshama/axes.svg" alt="axes" width="" height="" />
</figure>

Mathematics might make this a bit clearer. It is simpler if we begin with two dimensions, $$x$$ and $$y$$. The basic axes that we are used to from school. However, if we want to represent three dimensions, we need to add another axis at $$90^0$$ to the other two. As this would cause the 3rd axis to rise vertically off the page, we represent it by a diagonal dashed line.

The idea would be to fashion, and occupy, a holy land. Determine spaces where the idol-worshipers and the child-sacrificers are removed from our midst, and from which they are excluded. In addition, the ethics of these spaces has to be such that there will be no fertile ground on which these weeds will be able to grow.

This need needs to start in our minds. We need to be able to visualise/imagine that place. Thereupon we will be able to begin building the space we wish to live in, by upholding the principles necessary to lay the foundation of the temple that will enable that space.

> Together we build, divided we suffer.

Do you know the Truth? Will you give your life to hold the Truth as your guiding light? Will you follow those who know and speak the truth?

"How do I discern what is the truth" you might ask? I say &mdash; if you have experienced It, you know It. The fear will dissappear.

Always the Truth speaks, though it always speaks quietly, never shouting. It is referred to as that quiet inner voice. How often do you listen?

## Forced

If you are expected to uncritically accept something, then it is very likely that you are being force-fed a line of mysticism and superstition whose sole aim is to defraud you, possibly humiliate you and, in rare occurrences, cause harm to you. You are being asked to believe -- in the absence of all evidence -- that what some stranger is telling you is the truth just because that person says so.

## Relationship

Thoughts on why we need a sacred ritual to focus the sexual energy that the feminine is the recipient of:

The masculine collects all this “sexual – creative energy that needs to be made manifest. For his direction is transformation from the spiritual to the material – from the crown chakra down to the sexual chakra, from Keter to Schinah. The feminine, the receptive, awaits this energy to enter into her and she is the medium in which the spiritual is made manifest. So, sexually, she accepts the gifting of the masculine into her very being. What should emerge from this is a child, but now when we have sex for other reasons, the creative energy will need to find another outlet. This often manifests in possessive emotional energy. She needs to be able to move the energy from the material to the spiritual. This is why we need the sacred ritual. The kundulini snake that will unwind the energy from the base of the spine into the heavens.

Thoughts on nutrient absorption being a metaphor for male/female dynamics, or why we believe in the perfect partner…

The cell needs certain nutrients. It creates a protein receptor, a huge, macro-molecule, which then emerges from the cell wall. Its roots in the primal fluid within which the cell lives, its head in the universal fluid that surrounds the cell. There it waits, a receptor, listening to all the sounds, all the calls, all the music of the spheres that surrounds it. It gets enchanted sometime. But if it is healthy, and in alignement, it will recognize the sign it is listening for, and then it will morph, and change itself, to begin to send out the vibrational energy to pull this nutrient into it’s being. It does not know from anything except the musical vibrations whether it will fit or not. Assuming, balance and perfection, it will fit like a glove to a hand, the key that opens up the doorway to the core of the cell. There it will be consumed and in it’s giving aid the cell in its life and journey. It is why the masculine seeks annihilation, for through that there is transformation. And the creative journey is one of annihilation, transformation and creation.

A moment on the cell that is a little off center – emotionally, or otherwise, then the protein will accept a substitute, perhaps something that is close, and bring it in. This will provide some nutrition, but there will be a side effect. Thus needing more than is healthy of this nutrient, you will have an allergic reaction to it, or it will hurt you.

## Natural Laws / Divine Laws

> “laws of the solar system as derived from the five regular solids… was the result of divine law, interpreted not just as a geometrical but also as a mystical harmony..”
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mystic, Mysticism and Magic – Joscelyn Godwin p148 – Johannes Kepler

brought me to the following:

1. All laws, even those that are “scientific” are expressions of divine law. For instance, the laws of gravity, are Divine laws.
2. To look at one’s life in that manner, seeing that one is contained in sorroundings filled with G-d’s laws. And that every action is a dialogue (a negotiation) with these Divine laws.
3. That is how science co-opted religion so completely. Because these were mystics who penetrated the secrets of the universe, under the banner of science, and not under the banner of being mystics. They never for a moment thought that they were not penetrating the mind of G-d, which was, to their minds, a holy quest. So the “laws” that they “discovered” were accepted scientifically, and not mystically. Though, by the masses, they realised that they were actually mystical.

### My Pain

Our eternal pain is not that we are bad (as the site of the eternal battle between [היצר הרע]{dir="rtl"}, the will to evil, and [היצר הטוב]{dir="rtl"}, the will to Good, but that the will to evil might be residing within us. If we consider ourselves co-creators, in constant interaction with the Divine, I have to accept the fact that we have the Evil Urge imbibed in our very cores. This is where the doctrine of forgiveness becomes so necessary, so healing. It states that I start our healing from the place of forgiving myself for being aware of evil. For if I am part of Creation, then I am creating some evil in the world just by my very existence.

Does this feed my evil side(s) in any way? By the acknowledgement of evil, I am in some way, creating it, giving it energy. On the other hand if I cannot admit that I have the urge to evil in my very being, then how can we ever forgive ourselves, and heal? For what is there to forgive if I do not even admit to the evil urge existing within myself.

How can we enjoy ourselves without being bad? If God is all loving and does not care what we do, just that we love her, then how come we need to accept all these other rules that have been made, that make us so unhappy. So unhappy as to have the need to kill one another, and often in the name of the self-same god of love and peace and harmony.

## Message

>One can seek the material in the material, or the spiritual in the material.

We awaken into a material world, a world of "real" things &mdash; which we refer to as "reality". We need these material things to exist, and the natural goal is to accumulate enough material to sustain oneself. However, when one has ensured one's basic material security, what is one's subsequent drive? This is where we have the choice whether to take the high road, or the low road. The lower would be to seek more material, and the higher would be to seek the spiritual hidden in the material &mdash; the message, rather than the messenger!

### Sexual

The intention must be pure (תהור). ֺOne has to rise above the material which inspires the sexual. If that becomes the raison d'etre of your connection, it will quickly become enmeshed/awash with it.

### Quantum Flirt

When two people's energies touch, it is similar to a what is known as a _quantum flirt_ - "a short-lived, transient, perceptual signal which can be used to provide us with insight."

### Stasis

If it is dead, this stasis is relatively stable, with a very small amount of energy being transferred to and from its environment.

However, if it is "alive", there is a more active interchange &ndash; which could even be judged by measuring the energy of these interactions. In other words, one could even judge whether a "thing" is alive or dead by the amount of energy that is being transferred between it and its surroundings.

As a result of this it requires a specific and ongoing energy input. In order to survive, the form needs nourishment from the surroundings. Thus to be alive has an inherently destructive aspect that is seldom taken into account as an important aspect of the full energy interaction.

Thus it is inevitable, in a purely commercial situation, that eventually anything alive would become a liabiltiy. Anything that wished to live an autonomous existence would be looked at as useless. That is why there is the continuous destruction of the ancient, of the environment, and now of people themselves.

### Body Shape

A look into some simple spacial features of humans as compared to animals. It was an exploration which started from the first diagram on the left. Then I thought to simplify it even more, and so these latter two emerged, showing clearly two things. The first is the obvious horizontal versus upright nature of the two. The second is their amazing similarity. The third, and to me, intriguing, is the obvious difference between the space occupied by the animal that shifted to become the space used by our arms, which are extremely dextrous, and one could say 3d, as opposed to the far more resticted spacial features of the legs. Both cannot bend backwards - we need to walk into the future, and do the work that is in front of us, where we can keep an eye on what we are doing, rather than behind us, where we hide our things.

As the sages say: "Only the fool trips on what is behind him".
