## Centre

And to some extent the rules and mechanics of measurement.

## The truth

> The truth will set you free --
> to do good,
> or to do evil!

## Your Gift

> During the building phase, your gift is your tool. If it becomes a sword, then, if you live by the sword, you will die by the sword.

## Spiritual Gym

A spiritual gym is a place where you

- lift weights/concepts heavier than regularly
- carry a concept further than usual
- refine your techniques of research

## Spiritual Lab

A spiritual laboratory is where you carry out carefully crafted experiments to see what responds.

## Inner Shape

> Many teach you about external movements, how to deal with outside forces. But it is the inner shape that is most important. For it is through the inner shape, that we experience the outer.Here we shape the inner. We focus on the internal shape of things. But what occurs on the outside is of prime importance.

As the eyes and the ears, the nose and mouth, the heart, legs and arms of G-d having a human experience - this is where you could begin to embrace and embody the truth of your existence.

## Female

If you accept the fact that you are young and beautiful, and every man is going to try and kiss you&mdash;you will be more able to determine what goes on around you. All I say is - be gracious. Only use what you have to to get what you need. Don't be cruel.

## Heaven

## Sex

Society can only, and needs to, operate in a sexless environment. Once sex enters the picture, it introduces all the emotional trauma and baggage that a person (people) carry and their relationship with power and money.

This is the connection between the internal and the external.
