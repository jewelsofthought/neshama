> If richer and fuller languages for redemption are to evolve, fantasies that fetishise the past must be relinquished

> Each organ is a recording and playback mechanism, blood is the recording tape with metal filings, cells are the components that make up the living crystals, and bones are the crystallisation of this information.

> In order for there to be an outcome, the laws of symmetry must be broken.

> Just as we wake in the morning hungry for food to nourish our bodies, do we need to awaken with the same spiritual hunger to sustain our souls.

> "Nothing left to lose" implies that you had something to lose and then were placed&mdash;or forced&mdash; into having nothing left to lose.

> To live a "big" life takes "big" energy, not only from you, but from your environment. Think of moving a skateboard 1km, versus a car, or an 18-wheeler..

> During the growing phase , your gift is your tool. If it becomes a weapon, then you will live by the rule of the sword.

> Eldership is attained/ordained when you gain the wisdom of your gift. Which is expressed in gratitude: "I have been granted my portion." That is "I have been blessed with the gift of ...".

## All change can only happen via יהוה

> If **Ha'Shem** is the **Source of everything**, then true manifestation can only extend from this **Source**. Therefore we must direct any and all desire, any and all prayer, every request to **Ha'Shem** - for only **He** can cause real change to occur.

## Centre

> The centre is a position relative to the space of the containment.

And to some extent the rules and mechanics of measurement.

## The truth

> The truth will set you free &mdash

to do good, or to do evil!

## Your Gift

> During the building phase, your gift is your tool.

If it becomes a sword, then, if you live by the sword, you will die by the sword.

## Your Eldership

> Your eldership is obtained/ordained/recognised when you gain the wisdom of the gift.

Which means "I have been granted my share" i.e. "I have been gifted with...".

## Spiritual Gym

A spiritual gym is a place where you

- lift weights/concepts heavier than regularly
- carry a concept further than usual
- refine your techniques of research

## Spiritual Lab

A spiritual laboratory is where you carry out carefully crafted experiments to see what responds.

## Inner Shape

> Many teach you about external movements, how to deal with outside forces. But it is the inner shape that is most important. For it is through the inner shape, that we experience the outer. Here we shape the inner. We focus on the internal shape of things. But what occurs on the outside is of prime importance.

As the eyes and the ears, the nose and mouth, the heart, legs and arms of G-d having a human experience, this is where you could begin to embrace and embody the truth of your existence.

## Heaven

## Sex in Society

Society can only, and perhaps needs to, operate in a sexless environment. Once sex enters the picture, it introduces all the emotional trauma and baggage that a person (people) carry and their relationship with power and money.

This is an example of the connection between the internal and the external. The actual event, coitus, is not what affects the person long term, but the subjective, inner, experience of that act.

Even when coitus has not taken place, the influence of the sexual upon the behaviour of the people can still be significance. It can be exploited in many ways, both good and bad. If the ultimate goal of the usage is material it will result in perversion. If it is used for love, it will enhance all, especially all especially those who are in relationship with the participants&mdash;it is an act of love.

## Spiritual $$\leftrightarrow$$ Physical

If we are truly spirit then the physical world is a delusion, a projection, which we are constantly creating and maintaining. Thus our spiritual energy is dispersed in maintaining an illusion of ourselves that is incorrect.

The question then is whether you spend your energy in ensuing that your physical being&mdash;which is a delusion&mdash;is comfortable or in ensuring that your spiritual&mdash;where your true essence resides&mdash; being is nourished.

If it is the former, and all your spiritual energy is dissipated in material pursuits for the comfort of physical being, then it will diminish one's spiritual being until it will/may eventually be extinguished altogether.

## Birth

The impact of spirit entering the body, and encountering the constraining environment we are born into, is traumatic. This is what creates the spaces of forgetfulness, the places of cognitive dissonance. For how could such a limited space contain the full wisdom of Torah.

## Possesion

Is it possible for the soul of one person to "occupy" the body of another?

Most tales of possession speak of an entity, generally demonic, that takes possession of another. These encounters generally come from another realm. In order for this not to occur, you have to call to the Divine protection of your space and your creation&mdash;which is the body that your soul has "breathed life into". Remember how breath enters your body and the spreads and enters every cell of the body, so spiritually there is a breath or spirit, that vivifies every organ of the body.

We do have the choice whether to allow another power over us, whether to "give" one's power to another, or even more extremely, to a material goal or object&ndash;a drug, a woman, money, false idols, or some other form of material addiction. We are of an addictive nature, and need to direct, or constrain, our addictions appropriately. If we become addicted to positive things, like studying Torah (mental), worshipping G-d (emotional), practising random acts of kindness and chastity (physical) (_tzedakah_), that is the practice that we refer to as religion.

Mysticism, on the other hand, is a call to the unknown, by the unknown itself&mdash;which is referred to as the mystery itself. Through faith, the alchemy of the unknown, the dark, and mysterious, produces gold.

## Prayer

Come to terms with my .... nature. Emerge from the closet, so as to say. Live fully expressing the truth of who and what I am, in order to fulfil my purpose in service to my divine nature and my fellow humans.

To spread my wings and fly.

To be able to balance my masculine purpose and feminine desire for union.

To be free of the constraints of the programming of my past (ancestors). To release the constraints that prevent me from being who I really am and express the love and light of my inner being.

Focusing on joy in me life, letting G!d take me to the money.

## Darkness & Light

The darkness is inside. So whenever I am alone, I am in darkness. There is only light outside me. Thus when I are with others, I am in light (enlightened?).

Only when I am looking outside of myself, am I seeing light. Thus we conclude that outside is real because I can see it (see the light), whereas inside &ndash; where I cannot see what I am experiencing &ndash; is thus unreal.

## Choice

Assuming that we are faced with the choosing between a spiritual and a material option, if you choose the spiritual, then it is a spiritual path that you will embark upon. If, however, you choose the material option, it is a material path that you will find yourself upon. Both are filled with challenges and blessings, and both are valid. It is a life (existential) choice; and one can choose the other at any point. Though we say _choose_ the spiritual, and _fall into_ the material.
