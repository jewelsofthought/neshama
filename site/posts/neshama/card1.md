## Centre

> The centre is a position relative to the space of the containment.

And to some extent the rules and mechanics of measurement.

## The truth

> The truth will set you free --

to do good, or to do evil!

## Your Gift

> During the building phase, your gift is your tool.

If it becomes a sword, then, if you live by the sword, you will die by the sword.

## Your Eldership

> Your eldership is obtained/ordained/recognised when you gain the wisdom of the gift.

Which means "I have been granted my share" i.e. "I have been gifted with...".

## Spiritual Gym

A spiritual gym is a place where you

- lift weights/concepts heavier than regularly
- carry a concept further than usual
- refine your techniques of research

## Spiritual Lab

A spiritual laboratory is where you carry out carefully crafted experiments to see what responds.

## Inner Shape

> Many teach you about external movements, how to deal with outside forces. But it is the inner shape that is most important. For it is through the inner shape, that we experience the outer.Here we shape the inner. We focus on the internal shape of things. But what occurs on the outside is of prime importance.

As the eyes and the ears, the nose and mouth, the heart, legs and arms of G-d having a human experience - this is where you could begin to embrace and embody the truth of your existence.

## Female

If you accept the fact that you are young and beautiful, and every man is going to try want you, in one way or another&mdash;you will be more able to determine and control what goes on around you. All I say is - be gracious. Only use what you have to to get what you need. Don't be cruel.

## Heaven

## Sex

Society can only, and perhaps needs to, operate in a sexless environment. Once sex enters the picture, it introduces all the emotional trauma and baggage that a person (people) carry and their relationship with power and money.

This is an example of the connection between the internal and the external. The actual event, coitus, is not what affects the person long term, but the subjective experience of that act.

Even when coitus has not taken place, the influence of the sexual upon the behaviour of the people can still be significance. It can be exploited in many ways, both bad and good. However, if the ultimate goal of the usage is material it will result in perversion. If it is used for love, it will enhance all, especially all who are in relationship with the participants&mdash;it is the act of love.

## Spiritual $$\leftrightarrow$$ Physical

If truly spirit then physical world/life is a delusion, a projection, which we are constantly creating and maintaining, thus our spiritual energy is dispersed in maintaining an illusion of ourselves that is incorrect.

The question then is whether you spend your energy in ensuing that your physical being&mdash;which is a delusion&mdash;is comfortable or in ensuring that you spiritual being is nourished.

If it is the former, and all your spiritual energy is dissipated in material pursuits for the comfort of physical being, then it will diminish one's spiritual being until it will/may eventually be extinguished altogether.
