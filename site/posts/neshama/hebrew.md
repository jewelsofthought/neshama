## Hebrew

### Singles

- There are no individual letters in Hebrew, like 'a' or 'I' as in English. This is because it is regarded as a **broken vessel** if it is alone.

### Writing before speech

The Jewish culture is based on a canonised charter/book. Which has been a constant, an anchor for over 2000 years.

### During the exile

During the exile, the core discussions and writings occurred in Hebrew. There are many examples of important commentaries that were written in Aramaic, Yiddish, Latino, and other widespread local dialects. However, the core has consistently relied on Hebrew to hold its centre.

For instance the Talmud and Zohar were written in Aramaic. But the Torah has always been in Hebrew. And Hebrew remains at the core of the religion, so clearly, that it has no issue with useful/necessary additions written in the other  dialects.

The important point here is not that other languages were used to convey important religious clarifications of the base text, but that all those languages were written in the Jewish commonspeech of the time. We often used Hebrew letters to write these languages too, never forgetting our roots. But it is only Hebrew that after the Temple era was spoken less and less, until it was "banned" in everything but the religious context.

So it evolved for all the years of the exile as a written and not a spoken language. In addition, its usage during that time was almost exclusively biblical.

### Modern Hebrew

Until the emergence of the state of Israel, which then re-awakened the language (Hebrew) to speech and "lowered" it to normal, day-to-day, vernacular.

Which had also occured during the time when one of the most influential books, the _Zohar_, was written in Aramaic, which was the _lingua franca_ of the burgoining Jewish population in Eastern Europe. Thus it could be, if not "understood", then read, by many such people.

So could one now claim that Aramaic is the Holy Language, because Hebrew is now being spoken by the people again? Can Hebrew maintain its religious significance as the Holy Tongue, or should Aramaic be used rather - following the experience of the last 2000 years?

### Impact of modern Hebrew

This is my thought: That for 2000+ years Hebrew was not spoken, but only written - except in the Synagogues (or during discussions of Holy matters). It survived, almost exclusively, on the rarified air of the temple, and then, during the exile in the Temples (and other places of prayer) that spread throughout the Jewish diaspora. All young boys were taught to read and write Hebrew, fluently. Aramaic was the lingua-franca, so, of course, it was being taught too - and written with Hebrew characters.

Now, 2000 years later, it has been revived, and most of the important texts are being written in Hebrew - which has been massively influenced by the present day usage of the language too. In addition, treasure troves of texts, many previously unknown, have been unveiled, that have opened up new avenues of exploration.

For instance, the Rabbi's who, in their wisdom, decided to use the word _chashmal_ for electricity, had never really lived in an electrified society - which we do today. Nor, had the sages who decided to interpret what and how to purify the flesh we eat, what it means to be pure flesh, did not have to grapple with the strange influence of GMO's.

We know that G-d did not give us free reign &mdash; but we do have free choice. Thus when we are introduced to the _chashmal_ that surrounded the Throne, what do we do with this power? Whatever we can, or wish to do? The restrictions on using it on Shabbat, for instance, have nothing to do with its uses!

For _chashmal_ contains both good and bad, and as a power can be used for either... And that has to be written into the Laws. As do Laws dealing with the manipulation of G-d's material.

We are like gatecrashes, bursting into a new kingdom &mdash; which I term, the 4<sup>th</sup> dimension[^1] &mdash; like a bunch of ravenous savages, with all the enthusiasm of a bunch of hyped-upped teenagers. Like vultures, we pick at the body that we see sitting on the throne, believing it all to be just matter, just electricity. Never asking where did this electricity come from? Who made it? Why is it here? What is its purpose? Because if it is not human, it is still alive. [Note: Though perhaps living in a different form of consciousness.]

We treat many aspects of our lives that way. In fact, there have been many times, when, although human, it is has been looked at as if it is a mere object, a piece of furniture - even though it is identical to the perpetrator of such behaviour in every respect - except position. The practice of slavery is an example of such an attitude.

Nor are we listening to any of our Wise ones, whether scientists or priests or shamans. Once again, they are not saying NO. They are saying be careful. Listen, before speaking. Watch, and learn, before acting. Just as any elder would tell the youth... Let's foster a relationship that is beneficial to us all.

[^1]: It is only science that is behaving this way. The spiritual traditions of many societies, from antiquity, have spoken in length about this space.
