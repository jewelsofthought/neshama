## Boundaries

My work now is around boundaries. About honouring them,  defining them and about acknowledging them. Integrity is at its core. Co-dependency and chording is about not honouring boundaries. It is about addiction. About a belief in being incomplete, instead of Sacred, whole and complete. You think you need something from somewhere else, or somebody else. Sex, of course, is a great teacher of this. Even though there is a bonding that occurs that is similar to chemical bonding, I realised that there is a higher form, that fills the vessel. We seek the spark of light hidden in the world (_Tikkun Olam_), and it is through that knowing that we honour the vessel.

## Asymmetry

As I said, it is always asymmetric. I just didn't realise how completely asymmetric! Which actually makes sense, as it is the straight line opposition that forms the core structure. This core structure is unrelenting in its response, whatever the "consequences" to anything. Its purpose is to maintain the dynamic structure of creation. Thus all life is thus assymmetric, and not perfectly aligned to this core structure, but can only be partially aligned, which, in turn, produces the cycle of life and death.

## Magen David

I also realised some things about the Magen David and it's deep symbolism, about the energy "rising" and the energy "descending". It takes an infinite amount of energy to create the smallest manifestation. And it takes an awareness of the infinite to enter into a state of Grace. Yet, the core exists in the midpoint of the Magen David, for it is the virtual point that is _Tiferet_, the balance. Spin the Magen David and we form a sphere of influence (of Kabbalistic origin). Stretch a point (it has 10 points) and the sphere is malformed. That is an expression of unbalanced energy [see below](#the-unbalanced-line). A point being out of perfection. This is the interplay that manifests _Malkhut_, Creation. For, if there is balance, all is equal thus nothing can be manifest. So, fight a little with yourself, and you create &mdash; the artistic angst.

It is in our nature, in our desire for the union with our external Divine, that is the push to internal constriction. For it is that point of singularity &mdash; where zero and infinity meet &mdash; that is the still point at the center, the point of origin. It is like trying to pass through the eye of a needle.  In order to maintain some balance,  we need to train our minds to connect to this middle point, for it is in that place of contradiction, the zero point, the point of infinity, everything and nothing, that I attain a moment of Grace. That is the virtual point at the center of the Magen David.

## The unbalanced line

It is the line that vibrates (moves) between two places to produce the music of the spheres. It is when the line is not at it's most balanced, it is when it is vibrating off the straight line, that the energy manifests. At the still point of the fulcrum, the straight line, there is no energy â€“ there is peace.

Atoms combine to form molecules. That is dependency. They are drawn together for a certain task. To express a certain energy. A certain doing. Now they encounter other molecules, that either aid them in their task, or break them apart. If they bind in their task, then they might form lifelong bonds, or until they are broken (or fall) apart. Until they encounter other molecules or atoms to repeat the same task.

Even atoms of same type, although their nature is to be paired ($$0_2$$) if gaseous, they will not remain together for long before they need to split apart to partake in creating a molecule.
