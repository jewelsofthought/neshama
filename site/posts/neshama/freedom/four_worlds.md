## The Dynamics of the Kabbalistic Tree

| The Left Pillar                 | The Central Pillar    | The Right Pillar |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Form                            | Axis (Mundi)          | Force            |
| Receiving                       | The Pillar of Balance | Expressing       |
| Contraction                     |                       | Expansion        |
| Feminine                        |                       | Masculine        |
| Culminating in Manifest Reality |

In the _Sefer Yetzirah_, the Book of Formation, written down sometime in the 6th century or perhaps earlier, it speaks of the ten levels through which the Will of G-d manifests. These represent levels of awareness or vibrational levels. As the energy flows down the Tree, each _sefirah_ receives from above, shapes the energy in its unique way, then transmits it onwards. In addition to the ten _sefirot_, there are also four Worlds, or dimensions, through which reality is formed.

The descriptions here relate to the general level at each of the _sefirot_. There exists an entire Tree in each of these four worlds, and an entire Tree in each of the _sefirot_ of each Tree in each World. The manifestations of these energies at any given level or any given place will be consistent with the general characteristics of each of the _sefirot_. The Tree will reveal the World in which it finds itself.

### The World of ATZILUT (Emanation)

The upper two _sefirot_ make up the world of **Atzilut** or Emanation, and hold the energies we are in need of if we are to truly realise our freedom from bondage. But all we can do is prepare ourselves. The energies of **Atzilut** (and the energies of Beriah) are beyond our direct influence according to the model of the Tree utilised for the Counting of the Omer. These higher worlds respond to our readiness, but not to our control.
