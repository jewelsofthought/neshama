<p>
Mature love comes with - and brings - personal dignity. An intimate feeling of nobility and regality. Knowing your special place and contribution in this world. Any love that is debilitating and breaks the human spirit is no love at all. For love to be complete it must have the dimension of personal sovereignty.

Each day of the week we bring the energies of the seven lower _sefirot_ into the _sefirah_ of the week. This week our focus has been at **Chesed**, the _sefirah_ of Lovingkindness. On this, the seventh and final day of the week, we bring **Malchut**, the Kingdom, the “lowest”, densest, manifestations of energy, into **Chesed**. The most subtle and the most mundane, the “highest” and the “lowest”, of our meditations are joined today.

They will meet again on the first day of the seventh week, when the “host” _sefirah_ will have reversed, and **Malchut** will welcome **Chesed**.[^1]

Now the energies reach downward into the world of our experience. In **Malchut** we manifest using all the flavours of the upper vessels. **Malchut** is the intrusion of the Holy into the space(s) of the manifest, where it is hidden in the husks of materiality. Today we focus on experiencing this space as as an expression of the Loving energy of **Chesed**, providing a grounding for the fullness of the Tree – for each _sefirah_ contains an entire tree.

Our meditations for this day focus on the energies of the _sefirot_ at the right shoulder and the base of the spine[^2] and the channel between the two. The space of Loving energies welcomes the manifestation of the “real” world.[^3]

In the literal Omer period, following Passover, this is the final day of the Passover celebration for this year. Tomorrow evening we enjoy fresh _chametz_, bread made with leavening. Our ancient tradition speaks to the healing that is accomplished through this first week of meditative focusing. We are renewing our awareness of the multi-dimensionality of our being, and opening ourselves to an ever-expanding journey. It is certainly time to celebrate.

I focus my awareness more intensely on the Presence of the Divine in this world. I feel its deeper influence throughout my being. I am grateful for its constant love, and am blessed with increased awareness of this  Universal Source of Light/Love. I recognise that all reality is an expression of this Loving Presence. In all I meet, I am nourished by the  energy of its constant love, and am blessed with this Love.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

[^1]: The dynamics will be reversed, and the mundane will be influenced by the subtle, the lowest will be looking up. It is looking at the dynamic from the opposite pole. Useful and necessary for a deeper understanding of this interaction.
[^2]: It is the base of the spine if you are sitting (either on a chair, or cross legged). Otherwise it is the base upon which you are standing. One could imagine almost like a distanceless space between the base of your spine and the space upon which you are standing.
[^3]: As in the cosmic dance, Maya, dharma, etc.

Receiving lovingly, receiving kindly – loving, kind reception (receiving)

**Note to R’ Falcon**:

Now the energy of the world of our experience moves into **Chesed** to balance the Tree there, for each _sefirah_ contains an entire Tree. In turn, the fullness of **Chesed** connects today to this world. In **Malchut** all the flavours of the upper vessels manifest, but the Holy is hidden in husks of materiality. Today, this space is held in the Loving embrace of **Chesed**, as **Malchut** provides a grounding for the fullness of **Chesed**.

I understand the dynamic to be expressed this way. Each week for the seven days of the week, I focus on a specific _sefirah_ and experience that week “through the eyes/consciousness/awareness of that _sefirah_ during the whole of that week. For that reason, I begin that week with a deep meditation on the energy of the _sefirah_. Then, each day of the week, I focus on the interaction (awakening) of one of the _sefirot_ in the space of the “weekly” _sefirah_.

Let us say that I now look, with the consciousness of the weekly _sefirah_ at/through a specific daily _sefirah_. At, if I look at it as an external _sefirah_. Through, if I look at it as one of the “personalities” within the current weekly _sefirah_&mdash;like seeing it from that _sefirah_’s perspective (within the purview of the current weekly sefirah).

One of the ways of expressing this is through syntax. I would look at the weekly _sefirah_ as being the subject of the sentence, and the daily as being the object thereof.

I place myself at the centre of the circle, and the six points of the natural hexagon of the circle at the other 6 _sefirot_ – like 6 portals that I look at from the center, focusing each day on one of them.
