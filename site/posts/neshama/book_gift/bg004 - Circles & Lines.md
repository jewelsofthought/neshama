## 1st Principle: <b>The Unity of G-d</b>

> **All is One שׁמא** & one is the beginning.

### s1: Nothingness

Between something and nothing, exists No-thing.
No name, no word, no description, no feeling, no appelation can describe it. It is named the "Infinite Primordial Light", perfect & balanced, and "even in all directions".
As finite beings, we cannot represent infinite nothingness, but can only imagine it.

### s2: Middle Point

Within this perfect nothingness arose a single point.

## 2nd principle: <b>The Binary Nature of Creation</b>

> For every this, there is a that. (see The Enlightened Mind by Stephen Mitchell.)
