> 0 $$\rightarrow$$ 1 is a spiritual mystery. 1 $$\rightarrow \infty$$ is the miracle we are part of.

## 1st Principle: <b>The Unity of G-d</b>

> **All is One** [שׁמא]{dir="rtl"} & one is the beginning.

### s1: Nothingness (repeat)

Between something and nothing, exists No-thing.

No name, no word, no description, no feeling, no appelation can describe it. It is named the "Infinite Primordial Light", perfect & balanced, and "even in all directions".

As finite beings, we cannot represent infinite nothingness, but can only imagine it.

### s2: Middle Point

Within this perfect nothingness arose a single point.

### s3: Point expanded

> For anything to occur, there must be a force that causes it. And this force always moves in a straight line (unless acted upon by another force).

When this point moves, it is represented by a line, which expresses a beginning and an end, and thus time arises. Once this line emerges, then it becomes a radius of a circle, and the circle, defining the space of the beginning and the end springs into existence. Now we have the space with its two defining compliments.

We now have the point, the line and the circle (or plane).

## 2nd principle: <b>The Binary Nature of Creation</b>

> For every this, there is a that. (see The Enlightened Mind by Stephen Mitchell.)

Thus we have the upper & lower, dense & subtle, close & distant, pure & impure, and the greater and lesser balance. These define the perimeter of the space in which we exist. This we refer to as two-dimensional (2d) Thus we have the two complimentary points, and the relationship between them. These are the two points that exist in a symbiotic relationship, one with the other, in that one cannot be without the other. Thus we have the two forces and another force between. Like two siblings that emerge from the same womb. This we refer to as three-dimensional (3d). Once time has entered into the equation, we then have our fourth element, creating the four-dimensional (4d) space in which we exist.

### S5: Duality

The essential duality of our modern world is the wave/particle duality. Once it is measured or perceived/received, we then have an entanglement. Force is a vector is always pushing outwards, expanding towards the unknown that exists somewhere else. Form is force that is attracted to the center, and the form is an effect of angular momentum.
