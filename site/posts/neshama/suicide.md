Perhaps the soul needs to experience suicide. The drugs or dependence or anything else, even the voices, are just the pathways that can lead us to this experience. As the ultimate denial of faith, the only truly "unholy" (personal) act, that of the final negation of life, which is a denial of G!d, the Divine. It is, nevertheless and perhaps, that some soul has to experience this on their journey through this realm&mdash;which may not take only one lifetime. As it is said, "We can either take the long road through suffering, or the short, sweet path through the way of Torah."

To propose that G!d punishes us, abandons us, if we commit suicide, is perhaps untrue. It is a valid experience contained in the set of human experiences and as such is not "judged" in the same way. For G!d's judgement is not the same as human judgement. Think of infinite judgement as you would think of the infinite number that sits at the "end" of any line of numbers. Is it itself a number? For it contains all numbers. As we ask the question in mathematics: "Is the set of all sets itself a set?", so the question arises: "Is the judgement that contains all judgement itself a judgement?" All we can do in response is capitalise the first letter. Just as we use $$\Re$$ to represent the set of all real numbers, referring to that as an "infinite", so we may refer to the Infinite as the infinity that contains all infinities, or G!d, the being that contains all life. How leisurely we toss the concept around, oblivious to any over- or under-tones.

In conclusion: “The good and the evil of this realm is not the same as that of the spiritual realm”.
