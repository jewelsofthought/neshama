Using reductionist ideology, separate form into its parts and then reassemble a "better" version of the whole. What is the ultimate goal? Once it was to create a better "world", now perhaps it is to create a better "person".

Know thyself&mdash;for what purpose? Control! Either control of yourself, or if that is not possible, your surroundings&mdash;which might or might not, include others.

What is the end? To have humans controlling our environment, and all the living things, including humans. That is an extinction ideology, for we cannot control living things &ndash; only enslave them for a while. In the end, the only way to be safe is to eradicate all living things that are able to make independent, sovereign choices, some of which might oppose another's idea of safety and control.

G!d has granted us free choice. It does not bode well for those who wish to remove free choice from humanity. Constraining it, limiting it for the good of humanity and the proper functioning of a society, is acceptable. Removing it is not. Those who think they are in control are also imprisoned in their own need to pursue some seemingly (in)finite goal.

To remove Free Choice is to remove Creativity&mdash;the very life that courses through us. With no creativity, there is no evolution. If you believe in Darwinism, and that shit just happens, you are seriously deluded. For there are so many "miracles", unexplained evolutionary events, that only a blinded person&mdash;someone who has had his or her sight removed &mdash; "None so blind as those who do not **want** to see" &mdash; would not be able to see it.

Perhaps this reductionist philosophy suffers from the same malaise that religion suffers from. If all the discussion and practice that has emerged has not produced a more balanced and enlightened people and/or more justice in our societies, what is the use/purpose of all this exploration then?

Is there a way of measuring which would produce more fulfilled societies as opposed to which will produce more deprived ones? How could one "objectively" measure that? Only by reducing the human interface to the status of an object and removing essential elements from the equation. Perhaps moving from a static view of these objects, to their relations instead&mdash;which are dynamic? Acknowledging the inexplicable and unexpected in the unfurling of the creativity inherent in life.
