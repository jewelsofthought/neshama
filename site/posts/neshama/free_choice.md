Using reductionist ideology, separate form into its parts and then reassemble a "better" version of the whole. What is the ultimate goal? Once it was to create a better "world", now perhaps it is to create a better "person".

Know thyself&mdash;for what purpose? Control! Either control of yourself, or if that is not possible, your surroundings&mdash;which might or might not, include others.

What is the end? To have humans controlling our environment, and all the living things, including humans. That is an extinction ideology then, for we cannot control living things &ndash; only enslave them for a while. In the end, the only way to be safe is to eradicate all living things that are able to make independent, sovereign choices, some of which might oppose another's idea of safety and control.

G!d has granted us free choice. It does not bode well for those who wish to remove free choice from humanity. Constraining it, limiting it for the good of humanity, and the proper functioning of a society is acceptable. Removing it is not. Those who think they are in control are also imprisoned in their own need to pursue some seemingly finite goal.

To remove Free Choice is to remove Creativity&mdash;the very life that courses through us. With no creativity, there is no evolution. If you believe in Darwinism, and that shit just happens, you are seriously deluded. For there are so many "miracles", unexplained evolutionary events, that only a blinded person&mdash;someone who has had his or her sight removed: "None so blind as those who do not **want** to see"&mdash;would not be able to see it.

Perhaps this reductionist philosophy suffers from the same malaise that religion suffers from. If all the discussion and practice that has emerged has not produced a more "just" people and/or more justice in the world, what is the use/purpose of all this exploration then?

Is there a way of measuring which would produce more fulfilled societies and as opposed to one which will produce more deprived ones? How could one "objectively" measure that? Only by reducing the human interface to the status of an object and removing essential elements from the equation. Perhaps moving from a static view of these objects, to their relations instead&mdash;which are dynamic. Acknowledging the inexplicable and unexpected in the unfurling of the creativity inherent in life.

## Note on language

What has astounded me is the fascinating way in which language has developed. If one looks at these interesting coincidences, it becomes quite mysterious. For example, let's look at the two words _sacred_ and _scared_ in English.

Let's lay some groundwork. The consonants are the letters of form. In our case they are 'SCRD', which is the form of both _SaCReD_ and _SCaReD_. They cannot be expressed without the vowels which, in this case, are 'a' & 'e'. Vowels represent the feminine, and require the breath to be spoken, else they remain silent. 'A', the first letter of the alphabet, also represent the alpha, the divine.

_Sacred_ then has first the 'a', representing the _sacred_ and then the form 'C'. Whereas _scared_ first has the form, and then afterwards we have the divine represented by the 'A'. In the first, _sacred_, we place the divine before the form, whereas in the second, _scared_, we have placed the form before the divine. When we start with the divine we have 'creation' during which the 'creatures' were created. So we derive 'sacred creation' populated by 'scared creatures'.

- 'ED' is that part of the word that introduces the aspect of time.
- 'SCR' are root letters (consonants) and 'AE' are the vowels representing the feminine, breath & the divine.
- "C", a only hard consonant (the only one), comes before 'a' in scared, - 'a' comes after 's' in sacred.

So, the creature that accepts the Divine before form accepts the primacy of the sacred, whereas the one that believes that the form is primary, will be scared.
