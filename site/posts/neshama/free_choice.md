Using reductionist ideology, separating form into its components, with the aim of reassembling a "better" version of the whole you began with.     What is the ultimate goal? Once it was to create a better "world", now perhaps it is to create a better "person".

Know thyself&mdash;for what purpose? Control! Either control of yourself, or if that is not possible, your surroundings&mdash;which might or might not, include others.

Is the end goal to have a select set of humans controlling our environment, and all the living beings, including the "other" humans&mdash;those that are not a part of the controlling clique. However, this is an extinction ideology, for one cannot control living things &ndash; only enslave them for a while. In the end, the only way to be safe is to eradicate all living beings that are able to make independent, sovereign choices, some of which might oppose another's idea of safety and control.

G!d has granted us free choice. It does not bode well for those who wish to remove this choice humanity. Constraining it, limiting it for the good of humanity and the proper functioning of a society, is acceptable. Removing it is not. Those who think they are in control are also imprisoned in their own need to pursue some seemingly (in)finite goal.

To remove Free Choice is to remove Creativity&mdash;the very life that courses through us. With no creativity, there is no evolution. If you believe in Darwinism, and that shit just happens, you are seriously deluded. For there are so many "miracles" and unexplained evolutionary events, that only a blind person&mdash;someone who has had his or her sight removed &mdash; "None so blind as those who do not **want** to see" &mdash; would not be able to see it.

Perhaps this reductionist philosophy suffers from the same malaise that religion suffers from. If all the discussion and practice that has emerged has not produced a more balanced and enlightened people and/or more harmony in our societies, what is the use/purpose of all this exploration then?

Is there a way of measuring which would produce more fulfilled societies as opposed to which will produce more deprived ones? How could one "objectively" measure that? Only by reducing the human interface to the status of an object and removing essential elements from the equation. Perhaps moving from a static view of these objects, to their relations instead&mdash;which are dynamic? Acknowledging the inexplicable and unexpected in the unfurling of the creativity inherent in life.
