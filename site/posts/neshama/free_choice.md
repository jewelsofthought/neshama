Philosophy as a Tower of Bavel. Using reductionist ideology, separate into its part and then reassemble a "better" version of the whole. What is the ultimate goal? Once it was to create a better "world", now perhaps to create a better "person"?

To know thyself? For what purpose? Control! Either control of yourself, or if that is not possible, your surroundings - which might or might not, include others.

What is the end? To have human controlling the environment, and all the living things, including humans? It is an extinction ideology then - we cannot control living things - only enslave them for a while. In the end, the only way to be safe is to eradicate all living things that are able to make independent, sovereign choices, some of which might oppose other's idea of safety and control. What is called Free Choice.

G!d has granted us free choice. It does not bode well for those who wish to remove free choice from humanity. Constraining it, limiting it for the good of humanity, and the proper functioning of a society is acceptable. Removing it is not. Those who think they are in control are also imprisoned in their own need to pursue some seemingly finite goal.

To remove Free Choice is to remove Creativity - the very life that courses through us. With no creativity, there is no evolution. If you believe in Darwinism, and that shit just happens, you are seriously deluded. For there are so many "miracles", unexplained evolutionary events, that only a blinded person&mdash;someone who has had his or her sight removed: "None so blind as those who do not **want** to see"&mdash;would not be able to see it.

Perhaps this reductionist philosophy suffers from the same malaise that religion suffers from. If all the discussion and practice that has emerged has not produced a more "just" people or and/or more justice in the world, what is the use/purpose of all this religious exploration then?

Is the a way of measuring which has produced more fulfilled societies and which have produced more deprived ones? How could one "objectively" measure that? Only by reducing the human interface to the status of an object.

Perhaps moving from a static view of these objects, to their relations instead&mdash;which are dynamic.

algebra - geometry => sacred (creation) // scared (creature)
place creature before creator => scared
move creator before creature => sacred

-ed - part of language expression
scr - are root letters (consonants)
a - vowel, feminine, breath, divine

c - only hard consonant, comes before 'a' in scared, 'a' comes after 's' in sacred.
