## Dark Side

Everything has its dark side&mdash;not shadow side! For evil is an active force. Tha is why Satan gained such prominence. In fact, in much of modern Western thinking, the god of light, and the prince of darkness have been equivalent. One could think of evil as goal orientated&mdash;and that is not untrue.

The story of G-d in the Old Testament is a G-d of both of justice and mercy. Whether he is good or evil (in our eyes/judgement) reflects the manner in which we (choose to) experience Him. in our lives.

The fundamental elements of our lives are all pretty much the same for most of us. If it bad, or not going well, we might (or might not) pray. But, I ask, for _what_ do you pray?

## Prayer

The highest form of prayer is gratitude&mdash;for it reflects the knowledge and understanding that G-d is good. Another level is that of asking for help&mdash;acknowledging that you cannot overcome the evil urge without help. The best is to ask what it is that you need to do or change to remedy the situation&mdash;realising that G-d is merciful, and it is up to me to the work I am needed to do.

To rail against G-d, and His works; to beg or demand that He change, or change the situation is the gateway to Hell&mdash;to ask perfection to fix imprefection; to demand that the Unchangeable change? Is that just as we expect manking to improve and become better, we expect G-d to do that same? How arrogant and short-sighted!

Let me apologise for my judgements, and ask a question. May I?

# Who/What is G-d?

My question is: Who or What is this G-d you are (not) praying to? Perhaps, simply put, the picture is of God in heaven above, where He sees, and hears and knows everything. He is perfect, so that imperfect is....? If He knows everything, how can He allow evil to exist? That, actually, is an awesome question, and YOU have to answer it... not parrot some one else's version of the answer. Because then you place the care of your soul in antoher's hands.

Perhaps, if I am unsure of the truth, and obey/comply with, {comply is voluntary obedience} Him through His appointed emissaries, His emissaries will allow me membership into their club, which guarantees me membership in His club. Which leaves the problem of those others, that do not have membership...

Obviously, I live in a world of opposites &ndash; dark & light, good and bad, etc. I divide these two realms into that ruled by the God of Light, and the other, by a Prince of Darkness, the fallen angel, Lucifer, Lord of Hell and Demons, presiding over an everlasting place of flames and pain.

At the same time, I have to avoid the devil, both inside and out. He is everywhere (just like God), even in my very thoughts, guiding my actions &ndash; "the devil made me do it!?" Now, I must walk the narrow path between God's punishments and Satan's devious temptations...

## All is One

There are a number of ways to relieve yourself from this hell of two parents (God and Satan) fighting constantly. The one I am most familiar with is to resolve this conundrum by understanding the meaning of the _Shema_, translated loosely as "Hear, O Israel, the Lord, your G-d is One." It is the direction that will produce synthesis. So let us refer to this unity, the One, as One.

> One is One. There is no other.
> One is (in) everything. There is nothing else.
> One cannot be diminished by removing anything from One.
> One cannot be increased by giving anything to One.

One is NOT the ruler over everything. It IS everything&mdash;the good, the bad and the ugly. This One is referred to as the hidden aspect of G-d. The outward aspect is what you and I experience, and we will judge It by our experience of It. {Unless you have adopted another('s) narrative, and have become an extension of that other('s) drama, subjugating your own narrative to the "greater" one.}

## Hidden Face

Just as you (and I) have an outer aspect with which we engage in the outside world. It is that aspect of ourselves that others experience, what they "see", for it is the I that manifests in the world. But each one of us also has a hidden aspect buried inside ourselves, hiding from the world, and its evil ways.

And many of us are driven by a deep desire to find an other with whom you can share that deep connection, deep enough to open that hidden aspect to them, and hope they will respond with love. That is the place of One, the hidden Face of G-d.
