Each of us has their own unique experience. Within the fullness of life, there is every possible human experience, past, present and future that can be experienced.

Just as every normal child is born with the ability to understand and speak every possible human language, everyone has the ability to experience any possible human experience. Thus there is no human experience that a human cannot experience, except for childbirth, being biologically male.

So, actually, the only experience that separates human's is that of childbirth and&mdash;on a more subtle level&mdash;sex itself. Where the very act that is spoken of as the union between male and female is different for the male&mdash;who is the giver&mdash;and the female&mdash;who is the receiver. Which, in turn, produces different feeling in the person. Whereas love, true love, which does not necessarily have to express itself sexually, is the unifying factor in humans. It is an expression of the same hadronic force that holds the nucleus together.

Love is just that&mdash;a meeting between two souls. A relationship based on love is an agreement between two parties. If it is not equal, it is not then based purely on love. For other elements have entered into the love channel and disrupted it.

Love relationships do not start off with a prior agreement. Only marriages do.

To be able to have these experiences, One has to have created a universe that would be full enough to enable all possible human experiences to take place.

Think of the electro-magnetic (E-M) spectrum We are only able to envision a small part of the full E-M spectrum. But all the rest (even that which our sensors cannot pick up) is necessary to enable small visual range. Without this extraneous range of frequencies, this "outer range" of spectrum, there would be no ability to "see" the visual range.

Whatever incredible things we have uncovered in the universe that surrounds us, and that is within us, existed long before we discovered any of them. Most of the foundational pillars of any successful exploration into the true "make-up" of any aspect, verifiable&mdash;by what is currently accepted as "protocols of measurement"&mdash;we will find that its charactertics and behaviour are attributable to the object or event from its inception.

That is because every event is born from the conflagration of those elements, forces and characteristics that we discover them to possess (and more, that we have yet to discover). They existed prior to the emergence of said force, event or object.

In other words, it manifested those characteristics from birth&mdash;that is from the time of its first manifestation, it had those characteristics potentially within it already.

Some examples of this are: the speed of light; gravity; acceleration; the galaxies; the atoms; etc.

We are like "witnesses" to the ongoing miracle of creation. Something which our very existence is a part of.

How can a being become (or awaken to) consciousness if there was no consciousness in the universe prior to this particular beings awakening into consciousness. And further, consciousness of the fact that it is conscious!

How can something produce electricity if there is not already electricity existant in the environment, as well as the ability to receive and transmit it. If no energy is created or destroyed, only transformed, where did this energy come from then?

If I am capable of thinking (coherent) thoughts, and become self-aware, is not self-awareness already available around me? I could not have created (or discovered) it. I could only become manifest in a field of self-awareness.
