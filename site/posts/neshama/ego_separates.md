## Separation

<div class="poem">

Ego separates, spirit seeks union.
Ego is static, seeking itself.
Spirit is dynamic, constantly seeking.
Like form and force,
Something has to be static for anything to move.
My breath is air in motion,
His breath is the motion.

</div>

In order for there to be something, there has to be something still. It must be "still" enough to be separated from that which is around it. It can be recognised by the fact that it is "static", which can only be identified by the difference from that which "moves" around it. What differentiates it is its separation from things that are similar&mdash;which means comparible in measurement&mdash;to it. In order for there to be any stillness, there has to be something that can move.

> _Ego separates_

Ego seeks a static vision of itself. It wants to "know thy self", as one can perhaps "know" mathematics&mdash;not as one might "know" a women.

It seeks to reproduce itself. In its madness, it would like its world to be a reflection of itself&mdash;a god-like vision. Just as the true G-d made man in His Image, so man would like to make himself a G-d, his world an image of Himself.

> _Spirit seek union_

Spirit knows that all is One, and seeks union, seeks harmony, seeks to find that increase through resonance. Just as the ego is full of arrogance and pride, so the Spirit knows that it is just a part of the Great Spirit. It seeks to return home to the peace and harmony of Spirit. When Ego is guided by Spirit, we call it the Upper Ego, then it seeks balance and union with all around it. It finds the harmony by resonating with the energy and vibration that surrounds it.

> _Ego is static_

The only way ego can succeed in creating the world it desires, is to have a world of form, of static elements. Change is an anathema to it, for its view can only be unchanging. Once you "know" something, you wish it to be static, for any change means to learn anew.

In any finite search, once you reach the goal, you will want to hold your position, and all your resources will be used to maintain the place you desired, thus it becomes static&mdash;a loop, repeated ad infinitum, like all finite games.

> _Spirit is dynamic_

Because it is not seeking itself, but seeking to resonate, and harmonise with the ever changing mystery, the search is dynamic, expressive of life itself. It is what keeps the living in motion. For once you stop moving, you die.

And once you stop moving towards G-d, you will not you will die the spiritual death.

## Union

<div class="poem">

The need for sacred union,
Deep desire for the beloved
unfound,
Something moves in spirit.
True Union
occurs in the upper realms,
Union with another
occurs in the physical realms,
the bonded union
is consecrated in the lower realm,
It is the space
from which life emerges.

Oh, simply being,
we are called
to the darkness,
for there you find life,
Not another alone,
but your own.

Only in the depths
of your existence,
can you find the Source.
For G-d remains hidden.
We have to learn to see
the light in the darkness.

The golden path strikes
like a predator,
and descends upon you,
like a bolt of lightning,
and you awaken (or not).

Most times we trudge, step by step,
day by day, moment by moment, searching,
hoping, praying, calling
like lost sheep.

For those who can be quiet,
in the midst of the braying,
finding rest within the constant
noise of action
And in those precious moments of peace,
perhaps the Voice is heard - with ears
normally attuned to the clamour of life.
Aah, to see with eyes
that have been taught to see.

It is a Siren call - full of life
and lust. Follow it -
and it will always lead to sin
where you will be blessed
with the sacred gift
of choice...

Choose the darkness,
it will with remain with you
like a lover
that will never leave,
and eventually you will become
so bonded, that you will have no
choice but to become its slave,

Pray that one day you awaken,
and realise that you are worthy
of redemption,
unless the lightning bolt
of {[mazal](mazal.html)} blesses you
and you are released, like a man
suddenly sprung from a prison of
your own making.

Choose the light, and it will guide you,
and challenge you to your core.
It will remain with you,
as long as you remain humble
and faithful,
grateful to be blessed
with the fruit that falls from
the Tree of Life.

</div>
