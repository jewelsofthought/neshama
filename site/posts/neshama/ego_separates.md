## Ego Separates

<div class="poem">

Ego separates, spirit seeks union.
Ego is static, seeking itself,
everything becoming a reflection of Ego.
Spirit is dynamic, constantly seeking G-d,
Like form and force,
Something has to be static for anything to move.
My breath is air in motion,
His breath is the motion.

</div>

In order to be perceive something, there has to be something still enough to be separated from that which is around it. It can be recognised by the fact that it is "static", which can only be seen because of that which "moves" around it. What differentiates it is its separation from things that are similar&mdash;meaning comparible in measurement&mdash;to it. In order for there to be any measurement, there has to be movement.

Ego seeks a static vision of itself. It wants to "know thy self", as one can perhaps "know" mathematics&mdash;not as one might "know" a women.

It seeks to reproduce itself. In its madness, it would like its world to be a reflection of itself&mdash;a god-like vision. Just as the true G-d made man in His Image, so man would like to make himself a god, his world an image of himself.

G-d made man in his image, He did not make the world in his image. We "create" children who are in G-d's image, but we try to fashion the world in our own image.

## Spirit seeks union

Spirit knows that all is One, and seeks union, seeks harmony, seeks to find that increase through resonance. Just as the ego is full of arrogance and pride, proud to be separate and "individualised", so the Spirit knows that it is just a part of the Great Spirit. It seeks to return home to the peace and harmony of the great Union with Spirit. When Ego is guided by Spirit, we call it the Upper Ego, then it seeks balance and union with all around it. It finds the harmony by resonating with the energy and vibration that surrounds it. When ego dominates, we find the seven sins open their gates, and soon we are in the lower courtyards of ego.

## Ego is static

The only way ego can succeed in creating the world it desires, surrounding itself in a world that refelcts it, is to have a world of form, of static elements. Change is an anathema to it, for its view can only be unchanging. Once you "know" something, you wish it to be static, for any change means to learn anew.

In any finite search, once you reach the goal, you will want to hold your position, and all your resources will be used to maintain the place you desired. Thus it becomes static, fixed&mdash;a loop, repeated _ad infinitum_, like all finite games.

## Spirit is dynamic

Because it is not seeking itself, but seeking to resonate, and harmonise with the ever changing mystery of Creation, the search is dynamic, expressive of life itself. It is what keeps the living in motion. For once you stop moving, you die.

And once you stop moving towards G-d, you will die the spiritual death.
