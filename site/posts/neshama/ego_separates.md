## Separation

```
- Ego separates, spirit seeks union
- Ego is static, seeking itself,
- Spirit is dynamic, constantly seeking,
  Like form and force.
  Something has to be static for anything to move.
- My breath is air in motion,
  His breath is the motion.

```

In order for there to be something,there has to be something still. It must be "still" enough to be separated from that which is around it. It can be recognised by the fact that it is "static", which can only be identified by the difference from that which "moves" around it. As opposed to what differentiates it is its separation from things that are similar (which means compatible in measurement) to it. In order for there to be any stillness, there has to be something that can move.

> _Ego separates_

Ego seeks a static vision of itself. It wants to "know yourselfself", as one can perhaps "know" mathematics&mdash;not as one might "know" a women.

Spirit knows that all is One, and seeks union, seeks harmony, seeks to find that increase through resonance.

Because it is ever changing, this search is dynamic, it is life itself. It is what keeps the living being alive &ndash; and in motion. For once you stop moving, you die.

And once you stop moving towards G-d, you will not stop living, but will die "differently".

## Union

<div class="poem">

```
A need for sacred union,
Desire for the beloved unfound,
Something moves in spirit.
True Union
occurs in the upper realms,
Union with another occurs in the physical realms,
And finally, the bonded union is consecrated in the lower realm.

Yet it is the space from which life emerges.

Oh, simple being,
you are called to the darkness,
for there you find life.
Not another alone,
but your own.

Only in the depths of existence,
Yours, can you find the Source.
For G-d remains hidden
We have to learn to see
the light in the darkness.

The golden path strikes
like a predator,
and descends upon you,
like a bolt of lightning,
and you awaken (or not).

Most times we trudge, step by step,
day by day, moment by moment, searching,
hoping, praying, calling
like lost sheep.

For those who can be quiet,
in the midst of the braying,
finding rest within the constant
noise of action
And in those precious moments of peace,
perhaps the Voice is heard - with ears
normally attuned to the noise of life.
Aah, to see with eyes
that have not been taught to see.

It is a Siren call - full of life
and lust. You have to follow it -
and it will always lead you to sin
where you will be blessed with the sacred gift
of choice...

Choose the darkness, and it will with remain with you
until you are worthy or "[lucky](mazal.html)" to be blessed again.

Choose the light, and it will remain with you,
as long as you remain humble,
grateful for the fruit that falls from
the Tree of Life.
```
