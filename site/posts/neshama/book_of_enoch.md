As part of the evolution of creation, "angels" emerged to seed the human species (and perhaps other species too). Hold on, this is G-d we are talking about &mdash; why not just create 4d beings in 3d? Well, because first you have to create a 3d world in order to that. And that is not so simple, as you can imagine. You need the correct 3d conditions for that to occur &mdash; and that would require both 3d and 4d realms. in fact, in order to have any order $$o$$, say $$n$$, you would need all the levels less than $$n$$ to exist. Thus to have 5d, 4d needs to exist, and to have 4d, 3d must exist, and so on.

There are the empiricists who base their cosmology on the existence of the material. [Just a small seqway. Material could be written mater**e**al, and could be thought of as the "mother" (mate) that "gives birth to" the real]. For them, the explanation of the existence of the "real" would be different.

However, if one traces the spiritual "evolution" from the Infinite Nothingness, the Void, to which we apply the No-Name Name, **HaShem**, the unpronounceable, and unpronounced, it becomes clearer. Think of the "complete" soul, the _nefesh_ journey as a cirlce. It is essentially, in the words of T.S. Elliot, "to know the place for the first time".

But, due to the limitations of our minds, let's imagine this soul journey as a line.

We designate the beginning of our narrative as the First. We could designate it as One, which is the First, but I wanted to emphasise that one is just a name we, in essence, give to the First, or the Beginning. On the "end", we have Infinity - which is endless, and a wondrous concept. One way of imagining this infinite concept, is to imagine the largest number you can, the furthest point you can imagine. That represents the boundary - the boundary of your imagination. Let us call this point, or place $$N$$.

It is known as the last &mdash; the last point of consciousness, beyond which you cannot even imagine or conceive. As is said, "Water cannot rise above its source". Thus our thoughts cannot extend beyond the source of our thoughts. This introduces the "source" of the line, the One who draws the line, seeing its beginning and its end, and thus existing before the first and after the last. After much searching for a rational expression of this &mdash; the mystics came up with the mind-bending concept of $$0$$, zero, nothing, the empty set. In the words of the Monty Python experience: "This parrot is no longer a parrot! It was! The parrot is no more. It is extinguished, dead, gone!..."

But hold on, how can there be nothing, when all I see, all I know, shows me that everywhere I look, everywhere I explore, is filled with things that are full of energy. But, counters the scientifically minded, we know (or is believe) from our latest scientific theories (QP in a nutshell) that all matter is made of 99+% of space &ndash; which is the name we use for nothing.

Before jumping to deeply into this debacle, let me remind you that this "nothing" that I am referring to is not not-something, but is pure, essential nothingness, and nothingness that perhaps everything evolves from. We actually represent the something that exists, and then what we are able to perceive and thus measure completes the picture of "something" exists. For "the eyes will see what the mind is looking for!"

If not, if you have an experience of perceiving something you mind cannot comprehend, a spiritual crises might ensure. In fact, often this technique is used to awaken adepts who follow a spiritual path. In Zen Buddhism, it is known as the koan, meant to shatter the chains of our limited minds with questions like: "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" or "If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there, does it make a sound?"

This zero, this nothingness, is also know as "the point of origin", the centre of the circle, the still point of the turning wheel and place of transformation. This concept also introduces the need for constraint in order for there to a transformation, and it is a pity that the word sacrifice was, and is, still used. I understand it stemming from the sacrifices necessary to atone for our sins, however, this is not actually a sin, but an action necessary to rectify a local system error. It is a spiritual healing technique applicable to living beings. This rectification is like a "sacrifice", a letting go, in order to attain a zero state, a reset perhaps, for one's sins

Let's explain it this way. If you encounter an error in behaviour, then in order to rectify it, you first have to constrain &ndash; ideally, eliminate &ndash; this error. Take for example some food that is not good for you, but not poisonous. A practice needs to be introduced to keep that space healthy, until this has taken root in the ground of your beings, and then it will be uniquely yours. The practice will be one of denying yourself this food, "sacrificing" the need/desire for it. And, because we life in a matrix of spiritual and material events, this is the material manifestation of the error in your system. Once, having dealt with that, one would need to investigate the spiritual reasons for this behaviour, or difficulty in sacrificing this need. These could be historical, emotional, psychological, or just a characteristic of the local system.

So, in conclusion, little can be said regarding this true nothingness &mdash; for there is no way to express nothing. For how does one experience nothing(ness)? For instance, how can a fish experience a waterless world? A word of caution here: If you touch this "nothingness", it might blow your mind, and you will never be the same again! This is the true mystery, the unknowable, infinite primordial Light energy.
