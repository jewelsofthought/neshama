R: Interesting. I think this is something we might only be able to speculate about. Who or what are 'divine beings'?

J: Beings that serve the Divine.

R: What qualifies as serving the divine? How do/can we know this? And What is the divine?

J: Are you really asking that question? You no longer believe in something greater or more encompassing than the human experience? Have you become a non-believer, an atheist?

R: No, I believe in something but I don't know what is. So i am still wondering even if I don't always ask.

J: What are you wondering exactly?

R: About the above questions. And whether there's a way for us to know the answers to them or if they'll always be mysteries to us.

J: Our very existence is a mystery that is by definition greater than us, and will always remain so. How much of what lies behind the mystery that we can comprehend is the exciting part of it. A better question might be whether it is possible to comprehend part of the incomprehensible through what is comprehensible.

However that may be, what is obvious is that there is an existence that contains or encompasses all of existence, and transcends it all. Just like all numbers are contained in infinity, which itself is not a number.

R: Thanks. That makes sense. What do you mean by 'divine beings'? If we are created by 'the divine' would that not make us divine too?

J: In that case all of creation is Divine, and all beings are essentially Divine. How do we then express our Divine nature? What of us is non-Divine then? It is that part of us that doubts or denies the Divine in and around us. That denies the ineffable Oneness of Creation and the Creator.

R: My thoughts exactly. No more duality. Everything has divine essence. But I see your point about awareness and ability to choose.

J: Remember, you do not (perhaps cannot) have to know WHAT it is. You just have to know that It IS.
