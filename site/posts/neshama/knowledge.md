## Knowledge & Intention

Knowledge is like a (some)thing. We can't put our finger on what it is, but we know it exists by its ability to "know" certain things. Simply, like how to do something - that is knowledge. Knowledge, except for the gifted, needs to be gained and trained. It is achieved by combining experience and learning.

Intention is from another realm. It cannot be "attained", though it too is only known by its outward expression - and will, of course, be tempered by what the individual (or object) "knows".

However, (conscious) intention is static! It requires the flow to stop - even if only to "realise" the intention.

If intention remains unconscious, then though it is not in the realm of the truly involuntary, but it is now entering into the dissonant realm, existing in an in-between place, a kind of limbo, in that it has a conscious aspect, though the consciousness that is "conscious" cannot understand the symbols and method by which this half-consciousness is attempting to communicate (and, generally, asking for help [unless evil]).

That is essentially the place where the shaman works. All he or she does is return with these "pieces" of information - a kind of a messenger, a human _Malach_, or angel. If this shaman is working with God, Great Spirit, _Ruach Ha'Kadosh_, then it will be up to the person to receive these "spirit" gifts, and by a wonderful magical process of synthesia or some form of strange empathy, fit it into their soul mapping. The person knows when it fits - and that work is only as true and effective as the authenticity of the person receiving the gift/message(s). "You receive in response to the intention, relative to the depth of the reception.
