## Awakening

Ways of awakening:

- Sex [F?]
- Entheogenic Journey [M?]
- Trauma (emotional, physical, mental)
- Constraints (charity, celebicy, fasting, disciplined prayer, etc)
- Lightning Bolt [!? unknown as to why]

An essential shift needs to occur. In order for that to occur, there needs to be a "death" of the old, so that the new fruits can flourish.

What is the new spiritual experience of sex, when it is no longer to procreate? Can this the need to procreate be fulfilled through love, and our need for love? Procreation was a survival vector, a basic need for survival, as is food. Now it is a vector that if continued will bring us to our knees. What is the new direction?

This will splinter and confuse. What is the goal of sex is not to procreate? This potentially amazing, blissful experience - which we call love? Can it survive and still fuel us, if it just dedicated to pleasure - the fun fair of life? Which, as we know, especially in the sexual arena, is filled with some very dark energies and desires.

Though it could become an entry into a spiritual experience, an "entheogenic" experience as such. Call it the little death. But in order to attain that requires some training, and it is much easier just to pop a pill to potentially have a "G-d" experience. In fact there are certain practices that are dedicated to this, like Tantra, etc. However, for them to be truly spiritual, one has to be steeped in the religious culture that it has emerged from, else it will just cater to ones base, and frivolous, desires.

As fucking is insufficient to attain bliss, so the medicine plant alone will not produce that Divine encounter that is often sought. It is just a trip - literally - to another realm. It itself cannot produce what we call an "entheogenic" experience, just as penetrating a women in not sufficient (though necessary) to have a spiritual experience of sex - which we call "love".

## Dark night of the soul

Little death: Dark night of the soul.

It seems in order to experience the bliss, there is also a need to experience the darkness. Perhaps that is what leads us into the temptation!
