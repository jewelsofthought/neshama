Inner Chamber:

- pocket of sub-conscious
- between effect and reaction
- the gap between action and re-action

The extent to which we do not control our reaction, is the extent to which we can be controlled.

If the spiritual enters this space, we become uncontrollable.

What prevent this healing is the placing of our ego in this space. As opposed to inviting the Divine to enter. Pray for G-d/Jesus to enter and clear that space. Offer it up to the Divine healing Power, because only the Divine can heal us. We do not heal ourselves. We need the Divine Light to heal. All healing is a form of creating light from darkness &ndash; creating something where there was nothing. Through forgiveness and gratitude, we enter this portal.

Aggressive with the vulnerable;
polite with those we are afraid of.

Jewish story from implosion of Europe to explosion of Israel.

Core of destructiveness in everyone;
core of creativity in everyone.

The brighter the light,
the deeper the darkness.

If the Truth is unspoken,
the wounds can never heal.

Best way of getting out of something,
is to get into it consciously.

- Remove the packet of energy (with Yulia's litany). The the Divine Creative energy will replace that has been removed.

More exposure of the inner,
brings more presence to the outer

What we don't own internally,
will manifest itself externally.
