## Dimensions

- Dimensions are actually synonymous with **Realities**. The realities are separated by different relationship with Time.

## Higher Dimensional Being(s)?

> Each step down from a higher dimension, requires the "removal" of an infinity!

Thus

> Any object of a higher dimension can only be partially perceived by a lower dimensional object.

If a finite being is part of an infinite event, it would (by definition) only be a partial representation of that infinity.  One would need to remove an infinite aspect of that higher dimensional object such that it will have NO effect on any other aspect of the event. Which is a polite way of ignoring any effect anything other than the realm(s) under question. Whatever has transpired in any other space will be, in essence, ignored.

Though by reducing a higher-dimensional being to manifest in a lower dimension, it will:

1. Appear as "something else"
2. It will have all the other dimensions still present, though perhaps dormant or constrained. Just as any higher dimensional object will have, in it, all the lower dimensional representations as well. For instance, a sphere can be represented as a circle, or only be perceived as a circle by a 2 dimensional being though the sphere still exists as a sphere.

Conversely, for the lower dimensional object to perceive a higher dimensional object, it would need to embrace an extra aspect of the infinite. That, however, requires two prerequisites:

1. That it has the desire to see this aspect.
2. That it has the capacity to perceive this extra (infinite) "dimension" &mdash; because all dimensions are necessary infinite in an infinite space.

Which brings in the question of whether a lower dimensional being can actually perceive any higher dimensional aspects of its existence. Or that it needs to be a higher dimensional being, perhaps asleep or entranced, that is awoken by its perception of the higher aspects dormant in its being.

> However, if of a lower dimension, or unable to awaken to a higher vibration, an experience of such a higher dimension would be expressed as "mystical" or, at least, "miraculous".

Imagine a group of people witnessing something miraculous. Firstly, there will be the group that will not even see it, or, if the do "see" it, they will deny that it ever happened. They imagined it, it was trick, there must be a logical explanation, etc. Among those that did see it, every eye-witness would have a different version of such a "super-natural" event.

> There are an infinite amount of projections of a 3d object onto a 2d surface.

Another way of saying that is: every 2d projection taken from another point will have a different view. That is why even eye-witness testimony is notoriously inaccurate.

Another difficulty with the higher dimensional experience, is to find words that might express this event. Words which are limited to the dimension on which communication has occurred. In additon, they are limited by the language and the culture in any express of any normal experience, how much more would if it were something inexplicable? It would suffer from just as much inaccuracy as the above 2d represenations &mdash; perhaps even more so. Therefore, any such higher dimensional experience could be experienced by a lower dimensional being as, in essence, miraculous.

## Divine purpose

If I am unsure that there is a God, or if I will even exist after this life, then why not attain whatever I am able in this life, however I obtain it, and deal with what comes after, if anything, when it happens?

There is one thing I am very sure of. The I that I am will not exist after I die. For that I that I am presently does die. The question is whether there is some part of this I that I am that will still live on, in some place of consciousness, in some space of self-awareness. What that "self" might be, could be very different from the experience of self I am having at present.

Already I have experienced something of that. For, the "I" that I thought I was when I was a youth is certainly not the "I" that I am presently. In the same way, the "I" that I might be, after my death, might be very, very different from the I that I am right now. The question arises whether there is an I that I am "always" ... or until that I that I am always is no longer!

Let us take a far more pragmatic and realistic approach than the "spiritual" or even "tribal". If there is God, and He has sent me down here and this is what I am, to do whatever I am capable of doing, to the best of my ability, then for what will he be punishing me? Is not my striving to achieve the best I can with what I have been given what I need to be doing?

It seems, even the best of us have our "dark" corners... And that is what we are afraid of. If we become aware of that darkness, then we have allowed it into our lives, but, if we spend our whole lives fighting it, then how can we achieve the best that we can achieve in the limited time we have?

Unless one turns that around, and says that all one's actual task is, is to fight against the evil that begins in one's own mind!

Which is essentially what almost all mystics and religions actually say. Anything else is socio-political, because this is actually the most revolutionary act that one can take as an individual within a society. It is the one act of true sovereignty. Paradoxically, by swearing your allegiance and trust in the One that is G-d, an unknown, and perhaps unknowable entity, nameless, faceless, but present everywhere, with all you heart and all your soul, you take the step into true sovereignty. As long as you are not bowing down to another human who becomes the sole conduit for the Divine Source of all Existence &mdash; for no one stands above another in the final judgement of who is worthy and who is not.
