## The miraculous

> Simple: God is the miraculous. God exists in and as the miraculous. The miraculous is G-d's way of speaking to us.

If a finite being is part of an infinite event, it could (by definition) only be a partial representation of that infinity. Each step down from a higher dimension, requires the "removal" of an infinity! Or more benignly, the reduction of an infinite aspect of that higher dimensional object to be nothing (0)&mdash;nothing in that it will have NO effect on any other aspect of the event. Which is a polite way of ignoring any effect anything of that realm has has upon the event under observation.

Conversely, for the lower dimensional object to perceive a higher dimensional object, it would need to embrace an extra aspect of the infinite. That, however, requires two prerequisites:

1. That it has the desire to see this aspect.
2. That it has the capacity to perceive this extra "dimension"/infinity.

In the end, Would not such an experience be expressed as "miraculous"?

Imagine a group of people witnessing something miraculous. Every eye-witness would have a different version of the story. It is like a regular map of the world that we see in atlases which is a 2d representation of a 3d object&mdash;the earth, and, as such, is not accurate.

Similarly, when watching a film of a real event on the screen, that is a 2d representation of a 3d event, and as such, is not true, but only a partial representation from a limited perspective.

Thus how to find words which are limited in language and culture to express any experience? It would suffer from just as much inaccuracy as the above 2d represenations&mdash;perhaps even more so. Therefore, any such higher dimensional experience would be, in essence, miraculous.

## Divine purpose

If I am unsure that there is a God, or if I will even exist after this life, then why not attain whatever I am able in this life, however I obtain it, and deal with what comes after, if anything, when it happens?

This is a far more pragmatic and realistic approach than the "spiritual" or even "tribal". If there is God, and He has sent me down here and this is what I am, to the best of my ability, capable of doing, then for what will he be punishing me? Is not my striving to achieve the best I can with what I have been given what I need to be doing?

It seems, even the best of us have our "dark" corners... And that is what we are afraid of. If we become aware of that darkness, then we have allowed it into our lives, but, if we spend our whole lives fighting it, then how can we achieve the best that we can achieve in the limited time we have?

Unless one turns that around, and says that all one's actual task is, is to fight against the evil that begins in your own mind!
Which is essentially what all mystics and religions actually say. Anything else is socio-political, because this is actually the most revolutionary act that one can take in the society. It is an act of true sovereignty.
