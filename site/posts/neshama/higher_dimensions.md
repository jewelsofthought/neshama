## The miraculous

> Simple: God is the miraculous. God exists in and as the miraculous. The miraculous is G-d's way of speaking to us.

If a finite being is part of an infinite event, it would (by definition) only be a partial representation of that infinity. Each step down from a higher dimension, requires the "removal" of an infinity! Or more benignly, the reduction of an infinite aspect of that higher dimensional object to be nothing (0)&mdash;nothing in that it will have NO effect on any other aspect of the event. Which is a polite way of ignoring any effect anything of that realm has has upon the event under observation.

Conversely, for the lower dimensional object to perceive a higher dimensional object, it would need to embrace an extra aspect of the infinite. That, however, requires two prerequisites:

1. That it has the desire to see this aspect.
2. That it has the capacity to perceive this extra "dimension"/infinity.

Would not such an experience be expressed as "miraculous", or at least "mystical?

Imagine a group of people witnessing something miraculous. Firstly, there will be the group that will not even see it, or, if the do "see" it, they will deny that it ever happened. They imagined it, it was trick, there must be a logical explanation, etc. Among those that did see it, every eye-witness would have a different version of the event. It is like a 2d projection of a 3d object, like the regular map of the world that we see in atlases which is a 2d representation of a 3d object&mdash;the earth&mdash;and, as such, is not accurate. Besides which, every 2d projection taken from another point will have different characteristics.

Thus how to find words which are limited by language and culture to express any experience? It would suffer from just as much inaccuracy as the above 2d represenations&mdash;perhaps even more so. Therefore, any such higher dimensional experience could be experienced by a lower dimensional being as, in essence, miraculous.

## Divine purpose

If I am unsure that there is a God, or if I will even exist after this life, then why not attain whatever I am able in this life, however I obtain it, and deal with what comes after, if anything, when it happens?

There is one thing I am very sure of. The "I" that I am will not exist after I die. For that "I" that I am does die. The question is whether there is some part of this "I" that I am that will still live on, in some place of consciousness, in some space of self-awareness. What that "self" might be, could be very different from the experience of self I am having at present.

But then, the "I" that I though I was when I was a youth is certainly not the "I" that I am presently&being no longer a young man.

Let us take a far more pragmatic and realistic approach than the "spiritual" or even "tribal". If there is God, and He has sent me down here and this is what I am, to do whatever I am capable of doing, to the best of my ability, then for what will he be punishing me? Is not my striving to achieve the best I can with what I have been given what I need to be doing?

It seems, even the best of us have our "dark" corners... And that is what we are afraid of. If we become aware of that darkness, then we have allowed it into our lives, but, if we spend our whole lives fighting it, then how can we achieve the best that we can achieve in the limited time we have?

Unless one turns that around, and says that all one's actual task is, is to fight against the evil that begins in your own mind!

Which is essentially what all mystics and religions actually say. Anything else is socio-political, because this is actually the most revolutionary act that one can take in the society, and within an individual. It is the one act of true sovereignty. Paradoxically, by swearing your allegiance and trust in the One that is G-d, an unknown, and perhaps unknowable entity, nameless, faceless, but present everywhere, with all you heart and all your soul, you take the step into true sovereignty. As long as you are not bowing down to another human who becomes the sole conduit for the Divine Source of all Existence&mdash;for no one can stand above another in the final judgement of who is worthy and who is not.
