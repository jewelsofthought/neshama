## Good and evil

> Good and evil are decided relative to the choice allowed.
> The essential difference between good and evil - good gives us a choice, evil never does.

It is one of the reasons we say that God is good - because He allows us a choice of whether to follow the impulse to do Good or that to do Evil.

Now we don't know how much of each there is, nor even how it is distributed in this world. We just know that it is, and it is everywhere!

In fact, the best we can do, is to build bubbles of space & time that contain the good (and thus bubbles that also "contain" the evil).

Let's change perspective, and look at this representation as one that speaks of "how evil, or how good?". And let's look at it this way:

There will be at least one spot where unadulterated evil can exist just as there is at least one spot where the true good can exist. These define the boundaries of the world of good and evil. They define the boundary of the domain of good & evil. What exists beyond? Well, in the realm of the infinite infinities, or the infinitely infinite, or the infinity of infinities.... who knows?

This then represents the space of the purest of good & evil, inside the circle are all the different gradations of good and evil - the _benonim_ (in-betweeners, the mundanes). In essence, the whole narrative is about you and I, the _benonim_, the "average", the "normal" - for we make up the vast majority of human existence.

You could say that if someone is purely good, then there is nothing that needs to be done. They will live a completely sovereign existence according to their inner edicts, and nothing can shake them or divert them. He will draw people to him by his integrity and clarity, but will not seek them out. He will allow them to find him and to leave him if that is not their path.

In the same way, if someone is truly evil, he too will live his life as truly sovereign driven also by an inner (or outer) compulsion. He will influence those around him, and those that he cannot influence - he will bend to his will. This is what makes the force of evil so potent.

The burning question of existence then becomes, if God is the creator of the universe, and therefore omnipotent, was He not the one who Created Evil in the first place? Why..? God? Why? That is a difficult question, perhaps THE question, especially in the midst of this inner battle of the _benoni_ between good and evil.

You can dedicate a portion of your life and consciousness to delving into this question. If you decide to derive your answer for/by yourself, it will become a life-long pursuit, which many fail at, or, most often, tire of. They then settle on either a half-baked or/and personalised version of the truth of what they are seeking, or live on shifting sand as they constantly renewing their commitments, or, most often, just settle on someone else's answer, or version of the answer.

Whatever answer you settle upon, whatever narrative you choose to describe who you are, will affect how you live your life, and many of the consequences thereof.

## Athiest

G-d is removed from the equation by the atheist, who will then replace it with nothing, or with some other belief system. Generally, it will be the latter. At this stage, most of us have replaced it with science, the ultimate expression of the rational mind or so it is described by its believers while not taking into account that the limitations of rationality.

What we find in that case, is that in the midst of the most rational of times (the scientific age), our behaviour becomes more and more irrational. Now we have reached a trans-human stage, where we can improve on the natural course of evolution with our science, and believe that we can replace G-d with AI - despite overwhelming evidence as to the risks and failures of such an approach.

On the other hand, if there is a G-d, and we act abominably, we blame G-d for creating us (humans) that way.

If we deny the existence of G-d, and we act abominably, who then do we blame? No-one, for there is no-one to blame, and we may conclude that that is just the way human beings are. If we replace the religious doctrine with a scientific one (eg. evolution) which supports this violent behaviour, then the jaws of the beast can close upon us.

The essence of a religious doctrine is that at its core exists something that is greater than the human conundrum. At its center, exists a being, a consciousness that is above and beyond ours. One that is perfect and merciful and good, all in a manner that is beyond anyone's comprehension, and thus can only be held in faith and in belief. If we do not believe that there is a better life, a better way for people to live than to kill and brutalise one another, one that is achievable - what hope or future do we have to look forward to?

If we remove G-d, blessed be His name forever, the saviour from our equation, then we are left with a human being the ultimate consciousness (as we would then acknowledge no other), and we have plenty of examples of said consciousness being insufficient and incapable in many circumstances.

For those who follow this atheistic doctrine, [AI](ai.html) would be the ultimate solution. Through the implementation of this AI system, the powerful elites would be able to embed their positions of power. Which is happening as I speak.

> [AI](ai.html): A note on AI: Perhaps we have had such systems throughout history, just not referred to as AI. But any system that is imposed from the outside, and forces people to live in a certain imposed manner, is a form of AI. Legal systems are just that.

## G!d is King

The expression of a king is the belief that there are those amongst us who may be above us and control us like gods. Thus, the desire to be king is the ultimate expression of ego. When one reaches this pinnacle of desire it is manifested by one's entire world being a reflection of the king's ego. Anyone or anything that doesn't agree with his ego is immediately ejected.

The problem that occurs here is that a king cannot fully control those who believe in G!d. They cannot be broken from the outside. They stand against the absolute power that the king desires. If G!d is the King, then there is one who stands above the earthly king&mdash;and that is revolutionary.

However, having removed the dependency on G-d, replaced with pseudo-science and AI, which the king controls, enables the earthly king to gain absolute control over his people, body and soul.

There are those who need great monuments and lofty statues to remind us all of their greatness. But if they were truly so great, would their memories not be engraved in the human soul? Because, if the truth be told, many would like to forgot the atrocities that have been perpetrated by those monumental personages, directly or indirectly, on innocents. The truly wise do not need statues, for they burn their wisdom and (in)sight into our very being, bless them all. For the truth of the wise cuts deeply. They are often villified and persecuted for the unwavering bravery and adherence to the greater, more authentic, truth than that of our overlords.

Manufactured human artifacts representing divine are images of fabricated gods. They will, each and every one of them, be representations of the cultural power structure, just as those in power will present themselves as representatives of these gods that they have fabricated. These tales and myths of their exploits and greatness are told to the allay the fears of the people. They are also representing themselves (or the positions that they hold) as G-ds or as superior in some form or fashion to justify the control structure.

Many want a leader, or a king, to rule over them. Thus the only king that is no-king is an "imaginary" king, a king so perfect, so kingly, that no human king could ever hope to attain such dignity, This perfect king, or king of perfection, we call G-d, in English. Now if this god is just a king, then he will be like any king, both good and bad. So the only king that cannot be a king, as we know kings, is G-d, the perfect King. How paradoxical! Let us enter the realm of the imaginary. Imagine a King, so perfect.... Imagine this G-d of Perfection ruling over everything - and it is, of course, perfect. This king we refer to as "the Supernal Light" for he existed before there even was light - as if you could imagine such a thing. As such, as He is One and in everything - just as the number 1 is contained in every single other number - any one can become one with the One. Remember, if you combine another 1 with infinity, the Infinite does not change.

## Perfect world

Thus either we blame G-d, or separate evil from G-d, and propose another, equal to G-d, who we call Lucifer or Satan. This denies the essential Oneness of the Divine. It is an misunderstanding of the concept of the Perfection of The Divine Creator. How could the perfect G-d create an "imperfect" world? Why would the perfect G-d create a world filled with "evil"? Firstly, and most importantly, who are we to judge such a thing? We, who only see a tiny fraction of what IS, are saying that this totality, the immensity of the created world is "evil", or imperfect? How arrogant, and thus opens the door to someone claiming to be able to "fix" this broken world - a king, or leader, or even .... dare I say it ... a Messiah?

Perhaps a better question would be to ask "Why am I here"? "What is the purpose of my existence"? Which, contains some arrogance within it too - for there is the assumption that my existence does have a purpose - for whom? Only if there was perfection, and everything had meaning, would there be the possibility of any purpose in your or my existence. The basis of that assumption is, why then create all of this? Why create a being who is aware of the "imperfection" of his own existence?

How could I possibly know, really know with certainty, what the truth of my or our existence is? Thus I will grasp at what I can, which will be actions like: having children, being a good person, leading a nation, etc. But there are many who have spent their lives asking this question, who say there is an answer, a deeper answer. But that might inconvenience a comfortable existence - so why bother? Because if my existence is comfortable and I am able, why rock the boat?

As the instinctive way we approach this existence conundrum is from the finite space we are conscious of, as it will take a training consisting of years of discipline and practice to connect to the infinite space that exists in us, to realise that from the perspective of the Infinite Eye of G-d, all is as it should be. In fact, how else could it be, extending as it does from Perfection itself?

## Questions

Constantly asking "What is my purpose here?", "Why was I born?", "Why is my life so hard?", "Why is there evil in the world?". Who are we directing these questions to? Who would be best to seek answers from?

Let us explore this from a different perspective for a moment. Assume we are going to embark on a long journey. One that might take a lifetime or more. Assume we have set up a communications network, so that we could communicate with our base of operations, and possibly receive guidance from them if necessary. We would have set up nodes for our long-distance communications that would receive and transmit the messages we were sending to our base. These nodes are not just passive transmitters, nor are they passive receivers as messages would affect the behaviour of these nodes - something we call "intelligent" nodes - which would react according to the message received. There are certain trigger or control messages that should cause a shift in the node itself, and in the recipients of these messages. These would be sent when the recipient is in need of adjustment, just as we would sent one to any of the many satelites we send into space to explore the outer reaches of our universe.

The point here is that unless the receiver is clear, and able to receive the messages without any error, what is the garbled messages that it might receive?
Thus if you are not clear, and have not focussed on keeping your mind and your body clear, how could you expect to receive the messages that you would need to direct and rectify your life?

And to whom are you directing your questions about life and its purpose? It would be necessary to choose to direct them to someone who has dedicated his/her life to the exploration of such a path, through the study and practice required - whether dead or alive.
