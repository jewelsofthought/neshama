## Good and evil

> The essential difference between good and evil - good gives us a choice, evil never does.

It is one of the reasons we say that God is good - because He allows us a choice of whether to follow the impulse to do Good or that to do Evil.

Now we don't know how much of each there is, nor even how it is distributed in this world. We just know that it is, and it is everywhere!

In fact, the best we can do, is to build bubbles of space & time that contain the good (and thus bubbles that also "contain" the evil).

Let's change perspective, and look at this representation as one that speaks of "how evil, or how good?". And let's look at it this way:

There will be at least one spot where unadulterated evil can exist just as there is at least one spot where the true good can exist. These define the boundaries of the world of good and evil. They define the boundary of the domain of good & evil. What exists beyond? Well, in the realm of the infinite infinities, or the infinitely infinite, or the infinity of infinities.... who knows?

This then represents the space of the purest of good & evil, inside the circle are all the different gradations of good and evil - the _benonim_ (in-betweeners, the mundanes). In essence, the whole narrative is about you and I, the _benonim_, the "average", the "normal" - for we make up the vast majority of human existence.

You could say that if someone is purely good, then there is nothing that needs to be done. They will live a completely sovereign existence according to their inner edicts, and nothing can shake them or divert them. He will draw people to him by his integrity and clarity, but will not seek them out. He will allow them to find him and to leave him if that is not their path.

In the same way, if someone is truly evil, he too will live his life as truly sovereign driven also by an inner (or outer) compulsion. He will influence those around him, and those that he cannot influence - he will bend to his will. This is what makes the force of evil so potent.

The burning question of existence then becomes, if God is the creator of the universe, and therefore omnipotent, was He not the one who Created Evil in the first place? Why..? God? Why? That is a difficult question, perhaps THE question, especially in the midst of this inner battle of the _benoni_ between good and evil.

You can dedicate a portion of your life and consciousness to delving into this question. If you decide to derive your answer for/by yourself, it will become a life-long pursuit, which many fail at, or, most often, tire of. They then settle on either a half-baked or/and personalised version of the truth of what they are seeking, or live on shifting sand as they constantly renewing their commitments, or, most often, just settle on someone else's answer, or version of the answer.

Whatever answer you settle upon, whatever narrative you choose to describe who you are, will affect how you live your life, and many of the consequences thereof.

## Power fantasies

It seems that the lower fantasies are far more tangible, and thus perhaps attainable - and that is the essence of their attraction

Power fantasies: -

- lower: rape, enslave, control
- upper: control over oneself, balance in dealings with others,
