Friends do not need to share a goal, byt they do have to share some common values. A couple that merges with no purpose other then hedonistic, if they do not have a common goal, that will from in a vacuum, and end up being filled with all sorts of external impulses.

That is why there is "marriage", or some form of hand-fasting. It is not only to swear fealty to one anther, but also to declare that goal, having shaped their shared vision. If not, then it is just another external bonding.

In times of yore, the goal was of bringing children into the community, as well as generally supporting that to ensure the continuation of the tribe. This context was generally determined by the society. If it was determined solely and autonomously by the individuals themselves, marriage would then mean something else completely. At this stage we are caught betwixt and between, like being stuck in a passageway.

If our culture espouses the goal of individual freedom, then it will essentially become hedonistic and narcissistic. It will tend towards self-gratification&mdash;for what else will most choose?

There is a point here, in that society by its very nature impinges and constraints each member in order to create the form that is know as "society". That is different from culture, which is the expression of the individuals within that society. Which is powered by the innate freedom that we have as individuals, something which the society can only constrain.

Also, these free beings are easier to manipulate, as they don't have a common goal/form as of yet. So, in the dissolution of the society that follows the impetus to individual freedom, the power of form begins to emerge. The vision should be on of dynamic balance between _Halacha_ and Kabbalah, the practice and the spiritual needs of people.

Think of it as the difference between gas, liquid and solid. Solid is fanaticism, or tyranny. It has its attraction, being solid&mdash;simple & clear. Gas is very loose, and the individual atoms/molecules have a large amount of freedom. We need to be liquid, which, in order not to become muddy and bleed away, needs a solid container.

We all the time desire freedom from the constraints of life. Firstly, we have to accept that to be alive requires some level of responsibility, which will necessarily place constraints on your individual freedom. Everyone knows that having children will place that much more restriction on your freedom as well.

But, what is it that we **need** this freedom for? Hopefully to build a society that is different... less oppressive perhaps&mdash;with different values.

Where is our charter, the manual of commandments with which we march?

How difficult it was for the nation&mdash;without a state, without claim to a specific piece of land. But it had a charter, not as we envisage it today, but what one could call a "spiritual charter". One that in many ways made no apparent or simple sense&mdash;in this world perhaps. But nevertheless was a manual, a blueprint, that formed a people. Thus it has become a spiritual nation.
