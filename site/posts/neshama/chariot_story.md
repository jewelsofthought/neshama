### Journey to see the king

Only when he is moving too. Descends from His Palace on high. We know this occurs in the Northen hemisphere, during the period that culminates in the Day of Atonenment.

When He descends from Above, His summer palace in the mountains, to the depths of His winter abode, He lowers Himself &mdash; reveals His form &mdash; and can be approached on the road, which is far easier than gaining entrance to the palace of the Most High.

Still, the journey to find Him is long and perilous. Only when invited or called would you be guaranteed an audience. The only other way is when driven by desperation and He shows you mercy and intervenes.

As it says, when G-d speaks to you saying "Craft the chariot that will enable you to come to meet me", you obey His voice.
