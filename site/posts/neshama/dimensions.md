## The miraculous

> Simple: God is the miraculous. God exists in and as the miraculous. The miraculous is G-d's way of speaking to us.

Imagine a group of people witnessing something miraculous. Is it not that every eye-witness would have a different version of the story? It is like a regular map of the world that we see in atlases (or on the screen), which is a 2d version of a 3d event - the earth, and, as such, is not true.

And how to find words to express such an experience?

## God

If I am unsure that there is a God, or if I will even exist after this life, then why not attain whatever I am able in this life, however I obtain it, and deal with what comes after, if anything, when it happens?
This is a far more pragmatic and realistic approach than the "spiritual" or even "tribal". If there is God, and He has sent me down here and this is what I am, to the best of my ability, capable of doing, then for what will he be punishing me? Is not my striving to achieve the best I can with what I have been given what I need to be doing?

Because, it seems, even the best of us have our "dark" corners... And that is what we are afraid of. If we become aware of that darkness, then we have allowed it into our lives, but, if we spend our whole lives fighting it, then how can we achieve the best that we can achieve in the limited time we have?

Unless one turns that around, and says that all one's actual task is, is to fight against the evil, that begins in your own mind!
Which is essentially what all mystics and religions actually say. Anything else is socio-political, because this is the actually the most revolutionary act that one can take in the society. It is an act of sovereignty.

## Finite event

Even if the finite being was part of an infinite event, it could (by definition) only be a partial representation of that infinity. Each step down from a higher dimension, requires the "removal" of an infinity! Or more benignly, the reduction of an infinite aspect of that higher dimensional object to zero (0).

Conversely, for the lower dimensional object to perceive a higher dimensional object, it would need to embrace an extra aspect of the infinite. That, however, requires two prerequisites:

1. That it has the desire to see this aspect.
2. That it has the capacity to perceive this extra "dimension"/infinity.

Would not such an experience be expressed as "miraculous"?

## Hurdle of Language

This has the major hurdle of Language: how to express the inexpressible? In addition, it would be impossible for the finite to in any way encapsulate and experience of the infinite. For if there is a whole infinity that has not been explored, how can one express those things that have not even been perceived, let alone explored? How would one be able to express such a meeting?

Thus the depth of the journey can only be as deep as the symbols that one has to "guide" one on the journey, and, upon return, the icons that one finds/creates/adopts to express the ineffable experience. This is a selfless task, best expressed by the principle of there those are who have had this experience (esoteric) and those who have not (exoteric).
