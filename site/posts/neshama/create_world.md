It is about being taught that we can create our own world, our own environment. That is the freedom we all seek. The tribal directive tells us that we should all live the world within a certain framework, and that it is impossible to live without that framework, and be happy, or fulfilled or go to heaven, otherwise.

So, starting off as kids, where we are taught to accept the edicts handed down to us from above, whether it is by our parents, our teachers, or by any other adults. So we are born with others who have authority over us, and then we grow up to have the ultimate authority, in the name of God and his minions, describing the framework within which we are allowed to work.

Thus the ultimate cage. That of the one that is defined by God, and then handed down to us by Man. We often forget that this is just a Human interpretation of the Will of the God, the Unknowable. It is fortified by the mythos that surrounds the enlightened one’s, Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, to name a few. For they, being human like us, are also supposed to be Divine.

Now, there are two attitudes that emerge from this.

The first is that they are better, or different, than us. They are “special”. That is an attitude that fortifies the division between us. That there are those who are “special” and different, and thus deserve their differing status is life –the aristocracy, the wealthy, or even the prophets.

Then there is the more enlightened view, which states that if they are indeed human, then they are much the same as any of us. Thus, any and all of us, have the potential to become enlightened like any of them, and thus by the same token we carry the divine seed in each of us too.

Now, going back to the framework, it is an incredible testament to the creativity that we can achieve and accomplish so much within this limited structure. For, as we know, this structure, handed down to us in another human – and thus limited - interpretation. As we know, if the underlying framework is Divine, that is, part of the infinite One that is all we know and more, then the framework is essentially infinite in all directions, therefore anything’s possible.

{Note: Human, being the Divine and the human. Look at human as the limited side of our being (sometimes referred to as the ego). The Divine is the infinite side of our being. We can tell the difference between the two, by being aware of whether we are expressing the infinite side of our beings, or whether we are coming from the limited, part. The words that I associate with limited are fearful, belief in the Bad, restricting potential. The ones that are used with the infinite Divine are perhaps Love. From here we go to the next step, which is that this can only be expressed through our Love of God, the Divine.

That is the difference between Christians and Moslems. They both had prophets/visionaries who brought the message of Jehovah/Allah to their followers. Jesus however was referred to as the Son of God while Mohammed was the Prophet of Allah – not God or Allah, himself. This is the essential difference between these religions and Judaism. Now loving Jesus, Son of God, our Lord and Saviour, we do come to the cult of the divine human – something which the Moslems sidestepped, by never referring to Mohammed, Prophet of Allah, Blessed be His Name, as divine. We could continue here to look at the being that we are lauding, as a special being – the Son of God - for instance. Although Jesus did say we are all like Him too, did he not? So we end up with again with the doctrine of the divine human. Now the distinction here is that some of us are divine.}

However, the age of enlightenment of our society must be realisation that we are all divine. In fact, everything is divine, for everything comes from the Creator, Blessed be his Name, and everything contains an atom of His Energy. In fact, no Atom could Exist without His Hand in it. No Molecule can Form without His Blessing. And the conclusion of the conscious man is if you cannot see the Divine in something, it is only because of your blindness, and fear, and lack of love of the Energy that has Created us all.

Our eternal pain is not that we are bad (as the site of the eternal battle between ערה רצ׳, the will to evil, and בותה רצ׳, the will to Good), but that the will to evil might be residing within us. If we consider ourselves co-creators, in constant interaction with the Divine, we have to accept the fact that we have the Evil Urge imbibed in our very cores. This is where the doctrine of forgiveness becomes so necessary, so healing. It states that we start our healing from the place of forgiving ourselves for being aware of Evil. For if we are part of the creation, then we are creating evil in the world just by thinking about it, even if only for a moment.

Does this feed our evil sides in any way? By the acknowledgement of evil, we are in some way, creating it, giving it energy. On the other hand if we cannot admit that we have the urge to evil in our beings, then how can we ever forgive ourselves, and heal? For what is there to forgive? If we do not even admit to the urge existing within ourselves.

How can we enjoy ourselves without being bad? If God is all loving and does not care what we do, just that we love her, then how come we need to accept all these other rules that have been made, that make us so unhappy. So unhappy as to have the need to kill one another, and often in the name of the self-same god of love and peace and harmony.
