> One angel cannot have two missions. "Two angels cannot have the same mission." (_Targum Rashi_ on Genesis 18:2; _Bereshit Rabbah_ 50:2)

This is echoed in physics, where it states "No two objects can occupy the same space at the same time. It is not a repetitive universe, and no situation can re-occur in exactly the same configuration.

We might spend a lot of our time and energy trying to recreate an event that affected us from the past, but even if we repeat it, it will never be the same as the previous one. The classic example of this is sex. If one's first sexual experience is blissful and fulfilling, one will begin to see this bliss in further sexual experiences, but it will never be the same as that first one.

The negative version of this is that the experience is horrible, and so one will spend the rest of one's life avoiding this experience so as not to experience that horror again.

and behold, three men: One to bring the news [of Isaac’s birth] to Sarah, and one to overturn Sodom, and one to heal Abraham, for one angel does not perform two errands (Gen. Rabbah 50:2). You should know that [this is true] because throughout the entire chapter, Scripture mentions them in the plural, e.g., (below verse 8): “and they ate” ; (ibid. verse 9): “and they said to him.” Concerning the announcement, however, it says (ibid. verse 10): “And he said: I will surely return to you.” ... And Raphael, who healed Abraham, went from there to save Lot. This is what is stated: “And it came to pass when they took them outside, that he [the angel] said, ‘Flee for your life.’” You learn that only one acted as a deliverer.

### Metatron, the angel

An angel meets Metatron (or a Metatronic event) and it emerges into our reality &ndash; even if only as a momentary and visceral event. It is like the double helix of the DNA molecule. However the angel is not one of the two strands, but the energetic force of the _axis mundi_ around which the two streams, masculine and feminine, form. It is represented by the central column in Kabbalistic thought. Once again, it is not the column itself, but the energy, the space, that "holds" or maintains the column.

From the principle that states: "In order for anything to exist, there has to be the space in which it can exist. So before existence emerged, there needed to be space into which it could manifest. That "space" is measured by time! Not the time we measure, which requires already space for the object to be measured in, but space-time as in the emergence of the finite within the infinite.

We might think of this space as an expansion, but that is from a finite point of view. From the standpoint of the Infinite, the space is a contraction.

The angelic force enters via the the _Sephirotic_ gates and has to pass through each in order to incarnate (even for a moment). But once ensconced, it forms the link between the upper and the lower worlds of the body and the soul as an expression of the Divine Will to incarnate.

Driven by the desire for the Infinite as Oneness, the Unity, to have the only experience it could not have &mdash; that of separateness, of duality, of death. And in the realm of the One as Infinite, there will be the need to express this anti-thesis of Its own Being in some part of Itself.

## Creating my world

The realisation that we can (re-)create our own world, that we have the ability to influence our own environment is revelatory. That is the freedom we all seek. The unfortunate consequence of that realisation is that I have to take responsibility for my actions. I can no longer ignore the effect of my actions on others, nor my emotions or event thouts.

Although the tribal directive tells us that we should all live the world within a certain framework, and that it is impossible to live without that framework, and be happy, or fulfilled or go to heaven, otherwise, the next step is to realise that you are an individual within the group mind.

Starting off as kids, where we are taught to accept the edicts handed down to us from above, whether it is by our parents, our teachers, or by any other adults. Thus we are born into a world we are surround by those who have authority over us. Then we grow up, to be surrounded by those who now have the authority to demand our compliance, often in the name of God and his minions, adhering to the framework within which we are allowed to function.

It ends up with a desire to escape that web of constraints. The only way to do that is to become an authority oneself.

Surrounded by the ultimate cage, the one that is defined by God, and then handed down to us by Man. We often forget that this is just a Human interpretation of the Will of the God, the Unknowable. It is fortified by the mythos that surrounds the enlightened one’s, Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, to name a few. For though human like us, they are assumed to have a special relationship with the Divine.

There are two attitudes that emerge from this.

The first is that they are better, or different, than us. They are “special”. That is an attitude that fortifies the division between us. That there are those who are “special” and different, and thus deserve their differing status is life –the aristocracy, the wealthy, or even the prophets. This is often referred to as the "golden shadow". Whereas the "(dark) shadows" consist of self-doubt, guilt, and the other shadows that prevent us from realising our full potential, there is alos the golden shadow, which, by believing in the person that throws a "golden shadow" over you, you end up believing that you are less than that person, and can never achieve what he or she achieved. This is another, more subtle, way of saying to yourself that you are less than...

Then there is the more enlightened view, which states that if they are indeed human, then they are much the same as any of us. Thus, any and all of us, have the potential to become enlightened like any of them, for each one of us, too, carry the divine spark.

Now, going back to the framework, it is an incredible testament to the creativity that we can achieve and accomplish so much within this limited structure. For, as we know, this structure, handed down to us in another human – and thus limited - interpretation. As we know, if the underlying framework is Divine, that is, part of the Infinite One that is all we know and more, then the framework is essentially infinite in all directions, therefore there are a whole set of possibilities that we can manifest.

As a human being, we are being the Divine in human form, with human constraints. Look at the "human" as the limited expression of our being (sometimes referred to as the ego). The Divine is the infinite side of our being. We can tell the difference between the two, by becoming aware of whether we are expressing the infinite side of our beings, or whether we are coming from the limited, part. The words that I associate with limited are fearful, belief in the dark, thus restricting potential. The ones that are used with the infinite Divine are perhaps Love. From here we go to the next step, which is that this can only be expressed through our Love of God, the Divine.

<p>
**NOTE**: That is the difference between Christians and Moslems? They both had prophets/visionaries who brought the message of Jehovah/Allah to their followers. Jesus however was referred to as the Son of God while Mohammed was the Prophet of Allah – not God or Allah, himself. This is the essential difference between these religions and Judaism. Now loving Jesus, Son of God, our Lord and Saviour, we do come to the cult of the divine human – something which the Moslems sidestepped, by never referring to Mohammed, Prophet of Allah, Blessed be His Name, as divine. We could continue here to look at the being that we are lauding, as a special being – the Son of God - for instance. Although Jesus did say we are all like Him too, did he not? So we end up with again with the doctrine of the divine human. Now the distinction here is that some of us are divine.
</p>

The age of enlightenment must be realisation that we are all divine. In fact, everything is divine, for everything comes from the Creator, Blessed be his Name, and everything contains an atom of His Energy. In fact, no atom could exist without His Hand in it. No molecule can form without His Blessing. And the conclusion of the conscious man is if you cannot see the Divine in something, it is only because of your blindness, and fear, and lack of love of the Energy that has Created us all.

## Pagan Belief

<details>
<summary class='button is-outlined'>
paganism &nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>
</summary>

1. spiritual beliefs and practices other than one of the main world religions, specifically a non-Christian or pre-Christian religion.
   a: the spiritual beliefs and practices of ancient polytheistic religions.
   b: the beliefs and practices of contemporary religions or spiritual movements based on ancient paganism.
2. a modern religious movement incorporating beliefs or practices from outside the main world religions, especially nature worship.

**

A pagan belief is not to associate the Creator G!d with our world or the objects and manifestations thereof, but to believe and relate to (any of) them as actual god(s). It also does not believe in an omnipotent G!d. It is possible for a person (or persons) to achieve incredible things and have great influence upon us, but that is not sufficient to make them a god, though they could be thought of as G!d's hand having been laid upon them. What the consequences of having multiple gods ruling over the world around them might mean to them will be culturally based (and biased) and dependent on their beliefs.

However, we would be silly to denigrate our ancestors, and believe that they did not have as clear a view of the spiritual universe and its makeup as we do today. An [article in Britannica on Providence](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Providence-theology#ref410222) has something to say on the topic, showing that the belief in the Divine hand that rules us all was not absent in the pagan belief system.

There is only One Creator, G!d, even though, precisely because He is One, It seems to be made up of parts. However, each part, and part of parts, can only be It. That we are part of Creation means that we are it (in it, of it).

So the mystics will say things like: "I am having an experience of separateness". I say, that is what I am - an experience of separateness. Thus i am Creation itself, being that Creation itself is an event of separation - within, of course, an Infinite Oneness.

This separation is by being finite in an Infinity. It is a magical, inexplicable, and rather mysterious process of the finite part of an infinity. I like to say that it takes an infinite amount of effort to produce any finite. It would be a process of the infinite restriction (of Itself) by an infinite amount to become finite. And it manifests this process endlessly as a part of Itself.

Yet infinity is a concept, an idea, that can only be born from a finite part that, although experiencing itself and the world, as finite has realised that it is encased in, or stems from, an infinite environment. Only through realizing finiteness (finity) can you begin to perceive infinity. With that awareness comes the deep realization that we are separate from the Infinite that surrounds us. That is the darkness of our despair.

In mathematics, one extends a function called the Zeta function so that a series, like $1+2+3+4...$$, of numbers which would normally diverge, eventually attaining "infinity", converges instead to a certain number. That is not what is noteworthy though. The noteworthy action is, as the article below puts it, "making this new function produce finite values (when normally it would be divergent, producing infinite values) involves subtracting another divergent sum, so that the infinity from the first divergent sum minus the infinity from the second divergent sum end up as something finite.

This is just something to think about in relation to what I stated above: that it takes an infinite amount of energy to produce a finite being. Or, the only way you can affect infinity is with infinity.

Zeta Function ($$\zeta$$) &nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>
</summary>
<p>

For those who might be willing and able to read an interesting article on the topic, namely [Infinity or -1/12?](https://plus.maths.org/content/infinity-or-just-112) by David Berman and Marianne Freiberger. [Warning: contains mathematics!]{.tag .is-warning .is-small}
</p>
<p>
Using some high-powered mathematics (known as complex analysis) there is a way of extending the definition of the Euler zeta function to numbers $$x$$ less than or equal to 1 in a way that gives you finite values. In other words, there is a way of defining a new function, call it $$\zeta (x),$$ so that for $$x>1$$
<p></p>
$$\zeta (x) = S(x) = 1+1/2^ x+1/3^ x+1/4^ x...,$$
<p></p>
and for $$x\leq 1$$ the function $$\zeta (x)$$ has well-defined, finite values. This method of extension is called analytic continuation and the new function you get is called the Riemann zeta function, after the 19th century mathematician Bernhard Riemann. (Making this new function give you finite values for $$x \leq -1$$ involves cleverly subtracting another divergent sum, so that the infinity from the first divergent sum minus the infinity from the second divergent sum gives you something finite.)

## Place of choice

This is now the place of choice. The place of transformation. The existential fork in the road. Which way will you turn? It is not a place of up or down, in or out, but one of whether you choose to make your God finite or infinite. Your cosmology based on an infinite idea, or a finite one. Your choice.

    G-d is the exclusive source of life; hence life, by definition, is connection with G-d. A “life” of disconnection from G-d is pseudo-life — a life devoid of all but its most superficial illusory shell.
