## AI

> **Either our lives are to be determined by human created AI, or by divinely created AI. It is our choice.**

## Consciousness is fundamental

> We awaken to consciousness, but not to [spirit](spirit.html)

What does that mean "awaken to consciousness?"
_It means that at some point I became aware of myself, my being(ness), my own existence. It is an existential realisation. For the next step is the realisation that I will have to shape it, or it will be shaped by my environment and future history. But, there is no (need for) awareness of spirit in that process of awakening to myself. What Freud might call "the awakening of/to ego". Something awakens in you, in a completely unconscious fashion, and you are suddenly aware of yourself as a separate being._

How do I differentiate between what "consciousness" is, and what "spirit" is? How do I tell the difference?
_To become aware of spirit is a choice. It is to become aware of something outside of yourself, that is not a thing. How can you prove that there are things outside of yourself, that don't exist empirically in this realm? Energy is a good start, as it "exists" in our realm, but yet it has no physical presence, except through its effect upon other material objects. However, there are other more subtle things, like whatever starts our motor when we are born. The "energy" that fashioned me. That is the same energy that fashioned the Universe too!_

> 'virtual' - this is also the place of manipulation through the introduction of specific, controlled information. We can only cognite according to the rules we have been taught, with a certain spark, that if lit, could influence our conclusion. But we cannot remove ourselves beyond a certain point.

All basic 2d analysis only has 2 variables. What is the 3rd element that is necessary for a 3d approach?

It is the included middle. It is the future that either expands or contracts according to the choices you make, the narrative you speak of made up of your words and your actions. They either open up the future to greater possibilities, or close off possible avenues...

## Form

> The only true change is the one which makes no sense!

Form is memory - which is trapped energy, which means it is circular. Consciousness is awareness of what has just occurred, and the ability to retain (and even sometimes use) it. Thus the foundation of consciousness is memory.

## Message Broker

## Time

> Alan Afterman: _Time, Eternity, and Mystical Experience_.

The mystical path is a path that is focused on mystical encounters that lead to a mystical union, with time as energy.

Divide time into mundane & sacred time.

**Mundane Time**:

- Hold time (captive). Keep position. Control change.

**Sacred Time**:

- The Shabbat is the day that we focus on entering sacred time.
- Actually is "out of time", timeless
- Godhead exists in sacred time

## World of Separation

We exists in the world of separation in the realm of oneness (which is, in reality, the only "Other"). Measurement is a language of/to deal with separation (or those that are separate). Thus, out of the One come the many and out of the many, emerges One. In the bible it says that **Ha'Shem** is hidden in plain sight (or could I say, hidden from _plain_ sight.)
