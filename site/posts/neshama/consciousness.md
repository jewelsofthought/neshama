> Either we believe in a divinely ordained existence, or we accept that the cosmos and our existence are just improbable events that occurred by random chance. This cosmology will often lead to the probability of acknowledging a humanly ordained one, as preferable to the darkness and chaos of a randomly occuring one.

## AI

> Either our lives are to be determined by human created AI, or by divinely created AI. It is our choice.

## Consciousness is fundamental

> We awaken to consciousness, but not to [spirit](spirit.html)

What does that mean "awaken to consciousness?"

_It means that at some point I became aware of myself, my being(ness), my own existence. It is an existential realisation. For the next step is the realisation that I will have to shape it, or it will be shaped by my environment and future history. But, there is no (need for) awareness of spirit in that process of awakening to myself. Something awakens in you, in a completely unconscious fashion, and you are suddenly aware of yourself as a separate being._

How do I differentiate between what "consciousness" is, and what "spirit" is? How do I tell the difference?

_To become aware of spirit is a choice. It is to become aware of something outside of yourself, that is not a thing. How can you prove that there are things outside of yourself, that don't exist empirically in this realm? Energy is a good start, as it "exists" in our realm, but yet it has no physical presence, except through its effect upon other material objects. However, there are other more subtle things, like whatever starts our motor when we are born. The "energy" that fashioned me. That is the same energy that fashioned the Universe itself!_

_The revelation that closes the circle is when you realise that that energy is inside you too. That there are events occurring inside yourself that mirror those events that occur outside._

## Included Middle

All basic 2d analysis only has 2 variables. What is the 3rd element that is necessary for a 3d approach?

It is the included middle. It is the future that either expands or contracts according to the choices you make, the narrative you manifest through your words and your actions. They either open up the future to greater possibilities, or close off possible avenues...

## Form

> The only true change is the one which makes no sense!

Form is memory - which is trapped energy, which means it contains angular momentum, and is thus circular. Consciousness is awareness of what has just occurred, and the ability to retain (and even sometimes use) it. Thus the partner of consciousness is memory.

## Time

> Alan Afterman: _Time, Eternity, and Mystical Experience_.

The mystical path is a path that is focused on mystical encounters that lead to a mystical union, with time as energy.

Divide time into mundane & sacred time.

**Mundane Time**:

- Hold time (captive). Keep position. Control change.

**Sacred Time**:

- The Shabbat is the day that we focus on entering sacred time.
- Actually is "out of time", timeless
- Godhead exists in sacred time

## World of Separation

We exist in the world of separation in the realm of oneness (which is, in reality, the only "Other"). Measurement is a language of/to deal with separation (or those that are separate). Thus, out of the One come the many and out of the many, emerges One. In the bible it says that **HaShem** is hidden in plain sight (or could I say, hidden from _plain_ sight.)

## Dynamic

We think of consciousness as an awareness that is in essence static. Whereas the only consciousness that could be "static" is perhaps the Divine One. Ouor consciousness is dynamic. It grows, changes and adapts to whatever it encounters, changing perception and changing reaction according to its progress. Just as we encounter the growth and constantly changing aspect of our bodies, so it is similarly with our consciousness.
