## Apocalypse: unveiling!

This will herald in an end of days. It is clearly a fight between [good and evil](/site/posts/neshama/good_evil/) It is not a physical fight&mdash;though there may be much fighting that happens&mdash;but a spiritual one. The battle, as usual, is narrowing to be between those that fear G-d, the G!d-fearing, and those that hate G-d, the atheist.

> [Good & evil](good_evil.html): Good always gives you a choice; evil never does. Good supports and nourishes life; evil produces death, destruction, violence and misery.

Soon there will be no middle way. Either you are with me, or you are against me. The bifurcation will grow, and you will have to choose one or the other.

## Temple

Just as the future temple will be imaginary, so will the Presence that will rest there. If we could always live with the temple at our center, we all will have a place to congregate and celebrate our One. When we depart from that place, we will need to return to being human&mdash;with all our failings and aspirations. In any human society, one must expect every possible human quality and characteristic to at some point, emerge. There is no human system that can exclude the humanity in humans, else it will grow to become inhuman or non-human or even anti-human. The only system that we can create that is perfect is one that will have no place for humans to be human.

## Anthropos

The ego (_nefesh_), or Id, as Freud called it, can never be reduced or change shape&mdash;just like a living cell. It is only affected by what is in it, what it absorbs, and what is occurring in its local environment.

In the old times, we imagined the Presence resting in a Temple that we build on earth. However, our future requires the creation of the Anthropos. Each one of us will become a cell in the body of this Anthropos. Together we have to form it&mdash;but first we have to imagine it. It will not formed from the dust of the earth, as we have been, but from our light. It will be created from our living spirits joining to produce a Living Spirit that will "flutter over the waters". A Spirit that will imbibe all, and enable us to see one another in such a way that we will be able to know each other's truth. Such an Anthropos will be based on Truth.

## Balanced

1. Clear demarcation between inner and outer
2. Equal energy transfer
3. Balanced power exchange
4. Clear communication - not necessarily verbal
5. Self-sovereign

## Unbalanced

1. Unclear boundaries
2. Confusion between inner and outer space
3. Confusion over identity (non-sovereign)
4. "Agreements" and "contracts" to ensure "safety"
5. Against law of change.

Seek to create order and balance through not "allowing" change to occur is a form of death. A living being is one in which balance is attained through the harmonic resonance of its various components, reacting and responding to the influences that it encounters. In other words, it is in constant relationship with itself, and its environment.

## Bow & Arrow

> Gikatilla: We seek to balance upon the energies in order to "ascend"/open the control channel (pillar) as a boat/chariot (רחב) upon the ocean of existence.
