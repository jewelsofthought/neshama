## Apocalypse: unveiling

This will herald in an end of days. It is clearly a fight between [good and evil](/site/posts/neshama/good_evil/) It is not a physical fight&mdash;though there may be much fighting that happens&mdash;but a spiritual one. The battle, as usual, is narrowing to be between those that fear G-d, the G!d-fearing, and those that hate G-d, the atheist.

> Good & evil: Good always gives you a choice; evil never does. Good supports and nourishes life; evil produces death, destruction, violence and misery.

Soon there will be no middle way. Either you are with me, or you are against me. The bifurcation will grow, and you will have to choose one or the other.

## Anthropos

Seeking to create absolute order and balance through not "allowing" change to occur is a form of death. A living being is one in which balance is attained through the harmonic resonance of its various components, reacting and responding to the influences that it encounters. In other words, it is in constant relationship with itself, and its environment.

In any human society, one must expect every possible human quality and characteristic to at some point, emerge. There is no human system that can exclude the humanity in humans, else it will grow to become inhuman or non-human or even anti-human. The only system that we can create that is perfect is one that will have no place for humans to be human.

The ego (_nefesh_), or Id, as Freud called it, can never be reduced or change shape&mdash;just like a living cell. It is only affected by what is in it, what it absorbs, and what is occurring in its local environment.

## Temple

Just as the future temple will be imaginary, so will the Presence that will rest there. If we could always live with the temple at our center, we all will have a place to congregate and celebrate the Truth of our Creator. When we depart from that place, we will need to return to being human&mdash;with all our failings and aspirations.

In the old times, we imagined the Presence resting in a Temple that we build on earth. However, our future requires the creation of the Anthropos. Each one of us will become a cell in the body of this Anthropos. Together we have to form it&mdash;but first we have to imagine it. It will not formed from the dust of the earth, as we have been, but from our light. It will be created from our living spirits joining to produce a Living Spirit that will "flutter over the waters". A Spirit that will imbibe all, and open us to see one another in such a way that we will be able to know each other's truth. Such an Anthropos will be based on Truth.

## Balanced

1. Harmony between inner and outer
2. Clear boundaries
3. Equal energy transfer
4. Balanced power exchange
5. Self-sovereign
6. Clear communication - not necessarily verbal
7. Able to flow and adapt
8. Based on set of fundamentals, able to discern between permanent and temporary, immanent and transcendent.

The sin you sinned once and only once versus the sin that you repeat.</span>

## Bow & Arrow

<div>

<figure style='float: right'>
  <img src='/posts/img/qkab/math/gikatilla.png' alt='Like an arrow' width='200'/>
  <figcaption>Like an arrow, <br />we rise up the centre, <br />to experience a moment of grace.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

Gikatilla: We seek to balance the energies in order to "ascend" the channel of the middle like a chariot (_Merkava_) upon the ocean of existence.
