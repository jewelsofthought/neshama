## Cross

Jesus on the Cross is the wrong image, it is, in essence, homo-erotic,
though that is not the primary reason for its incorrectness

## Home-erotic

This it would be claimed, would be too erotic, and unsuitable for young minds, especially if she was half-naked, as would be expected. But not for the homosexually inclined. This could be a easily eroticised, just as erotic as a half-naked, young, lovely for women to a normal man.

However, if the female is to take her place beside the male in any discourse regarding the future of our society, and its norms of behaviour, she will have to be at least equal in any narrative on which this is built. Thus we have to change the narrative, and could call this decade 2020's, the New Narrative

It is filled with signs and portends: 2020 itself is indicative of a square (4), and 20x20. Square: 4 legs, 20x20, stable.

This new narrative has to begin with the question of why is the Messiah a man? Is it because God is a man? Is it because God is man's creation?

## Female

However, the female ravaged, the female crucified, is a much better representation of what has been happening in the world, and what is still occurring. It is not that it is only happening to the women. We know it is happening to the elderly, the poor, the children, the sick, the mentally/emotionally ill, and the economically distressed. But the point is, the essence of it is, is that it is essentially male dominated - in that it is men who are mainly perpetuating it. [With a strange narcissistic edge to it, as evidenced by the continuous homoerotic elements throughout the ages.]

The Jesus narrative, with the symbol of a man hanging bleeding and tormented on the cross, is just a narcissistic image of deep male anguish - a reflection/perception/expression of this dark depth of a male's soul expression. Essentially it is male gazing on male and his male narrative, with the women kneeling weeping at his feet - props in his, the male's, grand narrative.

But to show the weak, the earth, the soft, the very womb and bosoms upon which we are all nurtured being torn and ravaged by these male sycophants would create a new narrative.
