## Ego separates

- Ego separates, spirit seeks union
- Ego is static, spirit is dynamic, always in motion.
  Like form and force.
- Breath is air in motion,
  breath of the Divine is the motion.

```
Something moves in spirit, a need to enter the sacred path of union:
Union with the Beloved, is in the upper realms.
Union with one another occurs in the middle realms.
Finally, sexual union, is fed from the lower realm.
```

We enmesh the spiritual in the material in a very human way. We hide our lies and deceptions in that hidden, imaginary space, as well as our beauty and love. But what if the consequences of what we do materially have, essentially, material consequences, and not the spiritual ones that we normally are concerned about. Let us first focus on the purely material consequences of our actions, before we delve in the hidden aspects - and that is what I think jurisprudence is expressing. However the judicial system that emerges is crafted by those in power, and thus becomes a tool for maintaining that power - if not in the beginning, but definitely in the end. It starts with revolution to gain freedom, and then the leaders of the revolution become the same oppressors - just different faces.

[NOTE: Revolution - from the world revolve. So a revolution does not mean inherent change, they are generally just face-lifts. Evolution speaks of inherent change in the way it was done. And to add, the Sages say: "That the only form of evolution is to one in which you become better than your previous self".]

Notice here, I do not say that they do not affect the spiritual realm, but perhaps not in the manner and due to the events as we believe. As the system is continuous, or recursive - in that the every event is based on a sequence of events that occurred so that the seminal event could manifest. One cannot have vision without an eye, and a "brain" or perceptor of some nature that can "see" the vision. In other words, it has both the mechanism/technology available to see, and the perceptive capability to perceive and cognite (in some meaningful fashion) what is being seen. The one is purely technical, or emperical, the other is uncertain. To the materialist, it is the chemicals, or microtubules, or some other physical measurable event that occurs... whereas to the imaginative, there seems to be another element involved that we cannot measure with our emperical measurements, and is uncertain as to where exactly it is situation (in the brain - or elsewhere) - this we realm of spirit, or soul.

## Masculine & Feminine

> For the masculine it is about achieving something - and then he will be satisfied/happy. For the feminine is it about being in love & happy.

The "success" that the masculine achieves has to be constantly maintained and monitored. The more he achieves, the more attention these will demand from him. And one of the main tools of the _Sitra Achra_, the evil impulse, is to keep us occupied in the realm of the mundane so that we have no time to spend in the realm of the divine. That is to say that most of our day is taken up with mundane activities, most of our goals are emperical, and very little, if any, of our day is devoted to our relationship with the Divine. How many of your daily thoughts are taken up in contemplating what we don't know, what is not there? Being still and listening silent speech, rather than thinking and about the things and experiences and events of your own life?

A man must learn to respond, then he must practise responding in a constrained and balanced fashion. The woman must learn to contain her responses, and choose the appropriate responses, and, interestingly, the appropriate time to respond.

The role of the woman is well-defined, as the role of the man needs to be. The better defined that each role of the masculine is, the easier it is for the woman to be secure in her place.

> - **Love** without vulnerability is not love at all

Love, too, needs constant nourishment, though we know that material things are not what love needs - though gifts are always lovely. Admittedly, both men and women desire a materially comfortable life, that is not under question. And achieving that is a worthwhile goal. However, it is not sufficient to nourish love, though it might be sufficient to assuage the masculine, it certainly will leave the feminine in exile.

## G-d is infinite

- **G-d is infinite** in all directions. Thus He/She is infinitely vulnerable too, just as He/She can be incredibly cruel too.
- People don't look for a religion. We have a destination, and they will take the path that will- best lead them best to their destination, not taking into account the disruptive effects of their destinies

## Mathematics

- Take a mathematical approach to the spiritual realm, we seek spiritual equations with which we can express the dynamics of the system we are in more truthfully. There may be a spiritual calculus which can be used to describe the interactions that is more desciptive.

- Just as mathematics challenged and made more coherent, a large portions of our interactions with the world around us, so this spiritual mathematics would do to challenge much of the flotsam that floats around the central lake.

- Mathematics does not posit a self as fundamental to being, just a sense of self. We, however, have a false sense of self by believing that any meaningful understanding of this self can be seperate from the environment in which it was and is experiencing, as if we could be seperate from the brain processing. I mean, we think in our native tongue... and how many different languages have humans already spoken that we know of - and how many more are there to come?

## Consciousness

> Consciousness is a fundamental process/property of the universe.

One could think of consciousness as self-aware energy, and self-aware energy is energy that is aware of the information it is receiving and transmitting - to a lessor or greater degree.

I like to express it in terms of [dimensions](dimensions.html).

The above idea might open one to the theories of _panpsychism_, which says that even a rock has consciousness. It exists as a rock, with all the characteristics of rock, but is it self-aware?

However, there is a theory, a cosmology, wrapped in a practice and the living expression of an ancient tradition, in which consciousness IS the fundamental property of the universe, called [kabbalah](kabbalah_intro.html).

## Tearing openings

G1

Everflow to spill outside

- channel can overflow:
- channel can be rent:
  Like the glyco..phate tearing openings in the channels of the body - thus allowing toxins to enter the body. Or, could one say, adulterous chemicals. In that they are beneficial in the appropriate place, and toxic when in the in appropriate. For instance, it is reported the glco... causes lacerations in the intestines, thus allowing blood to enter the intestines from the circulation, and this blood contains the elements necessary to maintain one's blood, but the elements that do that, are toxic to the biohome of the intestines, thus turning the environment toxic. Per example, plastic is incredibly useful in your car, in your home, etc - but not loose in the environment. Though plastic, being indifferent, at the least, and toxic, at the worst, to almost all life.

## Energy

High (energy output) -> low
Low:

- Period of cleansing
- Dealing with unfinished business
- Shadows emerge
- "pay the bill", "take the hit", "lick your wounds"
- the only sin in falling is not getting back up

## Soul

1. Soul is immortal.
   It hears and sees and keeps everything that happens, or at least a portion of it. This portion we call a pointer and, as hypnosis has shown, again and again, through this mechanism, everything can be recalled. Freud called it the unconscious, then the sub-conscious, now it is repressed, etc... It is the deep reservoir of our experiences. We collect them and return with them, like a wandering explorer who returns with a knapsack full of experiences. Like arriving back at school after the summer vacation, filled with stories of the adventures you had.

**NOTE:** The USA, in its typical emperical, and capitalistic fashion, had to manufacture this summer vacation, and introduced the spring break event - which has now grown into a global sex, drugs and perversion fest for our young.

2. The purpose of soul is to serve -
   Because it does not need anything.

3. Soul needs to be resurrected in the body to good (_Mitzvah_).
4. Each incarnation expresses one purpose of the soul.
   _You are a soul, here to play a role_.
5. The marriage union of two souls becoming one is the re-union of a soul that had split apart.
