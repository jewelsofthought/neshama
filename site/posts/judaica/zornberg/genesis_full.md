## Acknowledgments

The genesis of this book was in the loving teaching of my parents, Rabbi Dr. and Mrs. Wolf Gottlieb, whose Torah of life animates me to this day. Many teachers have opened up for me the depths of Torah, among them, Rabbi Shmuel Sperber z7, Rabbi Chaim Brovender, and Rabbi Daniel
Epstein, whose scholarship and imagination inspired me to explore my own resources in learning Torah. Friends and students have been a source of insight and of warm support. I especially thank David Shulman, who responded to the manuscript with extraordinary understanding, grace, and enthusiasm. Susan Handelman, Baruch Hochman, Micha Odenheimer, Susan Shapiro, Debbie Weissman, and Linda Zisquit read some chapters and made illuminating comments. Other people helped in other ways, among them Julie Greenblatt, Diane Levenberg, Paul Mandel, Tessa Manoim, and Eva Weiss. I am grateful to Tamar Ross for many stimulating conversations, not directly on Genesis, and for encouraging me to begin a career in Torah teaching; to my late uncle, Rabbi Moshe Rosen z"l, for his constant interest and wisdom; to Freema Gottlieb, my sister and friend; to Judy Goldstein, for her cheerful readiness to help in computer crises; to Fern Seckbach for indexing; to the staff of JPS, especially Diane W. Zuckerman. Ellen Frankel has been an ideal editor, scholarly and sympathetic and unfailingly enthusiastic.

"I have learned from all my teachers, and from my students most of all" (Ethics of the Fathers). I am deeply grateful to the many students who have responded with passion and insight, in class and after class, to my teaching. I wish to thank the Littauer Foundation for its financial support. My book is dedicated to my husband, Eric, whose love and encouragement created space for thinking and writing. It is also dedicated to our children, Bracha, Moshe, and Avraham; their life and growth have brought us much joy.

## Introduction

These essays on the weekly Parsha emerged from ten years of teaching the biblical readings to classes here in Jerusalem. I was fortunate to have eager and intelligent audiences, whose spoken&mdash;and even unspoken&mdash;responses made it possible for me to discover, year after year, what further might be said on the matter-of-the-week.

These audiences were composed of a wide range of people, of all ages, professional and intellectual backgrounds, and levels of Jewish learning. The gamut ran from young American women and men studying in Israeli _yeshivot_ (colleges of advanced learning) for a year or more before proceeding to college study in the United States, to professionals, housewives,
artists, poets, and professors; from those who had had little previous contact with biblical and midrashic literature to those who had spent many years delving into the layers of meaning within these texts. The meeting places were some of the many colleges for adult Jewish education that have burgeoned in Jerusalem over the last twenty years.

What I did over the years was to share my own personal struggles for meaning, to discover the ways in which life and text inform each other. My audiences were in the position of "eavesdropping" on my meditations, on the literary and philosophical resonances emerging from these texts. These personal meditations were a weaving of biblical, midrashic, and literary sources; my students would receive a list of the sources and use them as a basis for further study. My mode of inquiry was closer to the "rhetorical" than to the "methodical," in terms of Gerald Bruns's distinction—the "rhetorical" having "no greater ambition than to discover what can be said, in any given case." The rhetorical mode, which Bruns sees as characteristic of most literary criticism, is "more concerned with finding than with proving, is more speculative than analytical, more heuristic than polemical." It explores problems, relationships, patterns, without arriving at single-minded or schematic theories. The rhetorician is a "public meditator."[^1]

My teaching mode, exploratory, ironic, open to turbulence, suspicious of fixities, had to be translated into an equivalent written text. There is no one specific audience I have in mind for these essays. I expect that readers from different backgrounds, "eavesdropping" on these meditations, in their written form, will find different parts of the book either strange or
familiar. In introducing it, I am, however, reluctant to engage in post facto methodological framings of my approach to biblical and midrashic sources. For essentially my way of reading these sources is highly untheoretical: the work of interpretation is done "in the field," in close attention to themes and motifs I sense within the words on the page. It is a kind of listening for the meta-messages of the text. My assumption is that the narrative block that constitutes a Parsha has thematic integrity, that the midrash is concerned to draw out the implicit dynamics of the biblical narrative, and to limn the internal tensions that continue, to our own day, to trouble and animate human beings. The field of energy that is thus set
up I have tried to register in these essays. I make use of an extensive range of sources to release the expressive internal logic of each Parsha. Some of these sources are exegetical, others are drawn from my reading in such areas as literature, literary criticism, psychology, philosophy, and anthropology. The exegetical sources range from the Talmud and Midrash to medieval and modern commentaries on the Bible, to hasidic meditations and homilies. The other sources constitute my mental "in-scape," the landscape of my mind, and, as such, must
inform my responses to the implicit dynamics of the biblical text. Here, I would like to spell out certain assumptions that may help the reader in engaging with a perhaps unfamiliar approach to the biblical narrative. One of my assumptions is that the sources I refer to set up a field of tension and mutual illumination with the biblical text. I am not looking simply to elucidate either what the Bible "really means" or what moral or homiletical uses can be made of the biblical narrative. I am looking to loosen the fixities, the ossifications of preconceived readings. To do this, a dialectical hermeneutics is essential: an opening of the ear, eye, and heart to a text that reflects back the dilemmas and paradoxes of
the world of the reader.

Two examples may clarify my point. When Rashi comments on the birth of Joseph's sons in Egypt, "before the years of famine came" (Genesis 41:50), he observes that we learn from that nuance of timing that it is forbidden to have sexual relations in time of famine. This comment, drawn from the Babylonian Talmud (_Ta'anit 11a_), is a legal principle gleaned from a close reading of the narrative. Normally, readers will assume that we are learning about life, about how to behave in time of famine, from the biblical text. Life is strange territory; it requires the
compass, the orientation of biblical guidance. The Bible is familiar, life is strange. We bring the two together, to shed light on life. What is produced in the end becomes a commonplace of proper behaviour, derived from, or&mdash;in a more sophisticated approach&mdash;drawing authority from the Bible.

My assumption is that a much more complex, dialectical dynamic is possible. If Rashi introduces into his commentary an observation about sexuality and famine, this can be read back into the original text. We are now encouraged to reflect on Joseph's larger situation, in terms of the dynamics of fertility, sexuality, famine, and corruption: Joseph's sense of
normalcy in a strange land is reflected in his oblivious fertility. We use Rashi's legal observation as a way to probe beneath the surface of Joseph's inner conflicts. An apparently homiletical or legal comment is also an exegetical one.

Another example would be Rashi's comment on the beautiful ending to Isaac's "courtship" of Rebecca. Isaac meets his bride, after an extremely long account of the matchmaking adventures of his father's servant. "Isaac then brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he
took Rebecca as his wife. Isaac loved her, and thus found comfort after his mother's death" (Genesis 24:67). Rashi comments: "It is the way of the world (_derekh eretz_) that as long as a man's mother is alive, he is attached to her [lit., bound up, involved]; when she dies, he comforts himself in his wife."

Here, again, a realistic observation about life is gleaned from the text; one might even describe Rashi's comment as Freudian, opening his readers' eyes to the dynamics of intimate family relationships. But, again, I would suggest that Rashi's apparent generalization provides us with a key to the narrative itself. Rashi seems to be describing a tension between two loves&mdash;for mother and for wife&mdash;experienced at the same time; only after the mother dies does the man turn "for comfort" to his wife&mdash;implicitly, the marriage
relation then assumes fuller proportions. In Isaac's story, of course, there is a gap, probably of several years, between his mother's death and his marriage to Rebecca. Indeed, the discrepancy between the situation in the Bible narrative and that described by Rashi should deter the reader from making too-facile extrapolations from the text to life. Precisely because the two cases are not symmetrical, Rashi's observation leads us to reflect again upon Isaac's relation with his mother, his involvement (_karukh etzla_) with her life and her death, and the nature of the comfort he later finds in Rebecca. This more complex vision of Isaac's situation would then reinform the reader's sense of what Rashi calls &mdash;the way of the world&mdash;which means, basically, the uncommon commonness of things, the ways human beings struggle with the nature of the world.

It seems to me that Rashi usually writes in such a multivalent way, transforming the reader's comprehension of the biblical text, even in his most&ndash;apparently&ndash;fantastic citations from the midrash. His commentary works as a dreamtext, suggesting many alternative &ndash;but not exclusive&ndash;facets of reality. In both the cases I have discussed, the feedback loop radiates a field of energy that includes both the reader, with his/her life situation, and the text. For to understand Isaac, Sarah, and Rebecca through a Freudian reading of Rashi is, of course, to reunderstand ourselves.

This field, or circle of understanding, yields endless illumination. If at first the text seems familiar, while life is strange, needy of privileged guidance, at a later stage of reading the situation may be reversed: life acquires a new familiarity, a new intelligibility, in the light of Rashi's deployment of midrashic sources, while the original text suddenly seems
alien, uncanny, needy of reinterpretation.

This dialectic of strangeness and familiarity is the gift of art; in this sense, I would regard Rashi and his midrashic precursors as poets. George Steiner alerts us to this paradoxical effect of art: on the one hand, "all representations, even the most abstract, infer a rendezvous with intelligibility or, at the least, with a strangeness attenuated"; on the other, "much of poetry, music and the arts aims to . . . make strangeness in certain respects stranger."[^2] It is the tension between these two statements that underlies my readings of Genesis.

This cycle of desire is present in all dimensions of life, intellectual, interpretive, as well as overtly emotional. The reader needs most of all

the animation of desire, which is generated, paradoxically, by the  
experience of "not to have:,,
the priest desires. The philosopher desires
And not to have is the beginning of desire.
To have what is not is its ancient cycle.
It is desire at the end of winter, when
It observes the effortless weather turning blue
It knows that what it has is what is not
And throws it away like a thing of another time
As morning throws off stale moonlight and shabby sleep.
— Wallace Stevens,
"Notes toward a Supreme Fiction"
"What it has is what is not": the economics of desire apply to priests
and philosophers and readers of ancient and modern texts. The aim of
interpretation is, I suggest, not merely to domesticate, to familiarize an
ancient book: it is also, and perhaps more importantly, to "make  
strangeness in certain respects stranger," to make the reader aware, in the
current that runs between his/her lived situation and the text, of the ways
in which we are "at key instants, strangers to ourselves, errant at the gates
of our own psyche."3
My approach, therefore, has been concerned to detect the intimations
of disorder within order, instability within stability, the tensions evoked
by questions about human life and the search for God that the midrash
expresses to such ambiguous effect. On the one hand, we are reassured to
find ourselves, with our most radical dilemmas, reflected in these ancient
texts. On the other hand, the midrashic strategy will not allow us to rest
in a formalized, serenely fixed image of human life, with merely homileti-
cal messages to brace us in desirable postures. In its variety and  
restlessness of versions of the narrative, the midrash invites us to read the text
with the truest — that is, with the least conventional, platitudinous, or
even pious—understandings available to us.
This is so because the Torah text that seems so plainly "there" can be
approached only by the strenuous and imaginative "making" of the
reader. This "making" has much to do with the intimate experience of
the human being in the world; more than that, according to Jewish

Introduction
mystical and exegetical sources, it is God's will of the readers of His book.
Whenever, for instance, the Torah speaks of the imperative la'asot,
usually translated "to fulfill, to obey," the words of the Torah, the Netziv
of Volozhin, author of Ha'amek Davar, consistently translates "to  
construct the meaning of the words of the Torah." La'asot indicates the
"making," the creation of Torah in the mind of the reader. This is not
passive receptivity, but expresses a post-Kantian understanding of the
active processes of perception.
If this reading of personal history in the Torah is not to degenerate
into a "reading into the Torah," there should, of course, be rules,  
decorums, a sense of traditional understandings. But ultimately, what I have
attempted in these essays is to articulate a personal meditation on themes
evoked by the biblical text. This may perhaps be termed an eisegetical,
rather than an exegetical, approach. It takes its cue from the kind of
reading of Torah that one poignant midrash sets in sharp focus. Rarely,
indeed, is the act of reading the subject of midrashic narration. Here,
however, the midrash powerfully reflects on its own enterprise.
In this passage (Yalkut Shimoni 1, 764), God asks Moses to help Him
with the difficult task of telling Aaron that he is to die:
God said to Moses, "Do Me a favor and tell Aaron about his death, for
I am ashamed to tell him." Said R. Huna in the name of R. Tanhum
bar Hiyya: What did Moses do? He rose early in the morning and
went over to Aaron's place. He began calling out [korei], "Aaron, my
brother!" Aaron came down to him and asked, "How is that you have
come here so early today?" Moses answered, "There is a davar, a thing/
word, a problem from the Torah that I was mulling over [mebarher]
during the night, and it gave me great difficulty. That is why I have
come over to visit you so early in the morning." Aaron asked, "What is
the problem?" Moses answered, "I don't know what it was—but I do
know that it is in the book of Genesis. Bring it, and let us read [nikra] in
it." They took the book of Genesis and read in it, story by story, and at
each one, Aaron said, "God did well, He created well." But when they
came to the creation of Adam, Moses said, "What shall I say about
Adam who brought death to the world?" Aaron replied, "My brother
Moses, you surely would not say that in this we do not accept the decree
of God? We have read how Adam and Eve were created and how they
merited thirteen wedding canopies, as it said, 'You were in Eden, the
garden of God' (Ezekiel 28:13), and how Adam ate of the Tree, and was
told, Tor dust you are, and to dust you shall return\* (Genesis 3:19) —

Introduction
xvn
and after all this glory, that they should come to this ..." Then Moses
said, "What about me —who had control over the ministering angels?
and what about you —who halted the spread of death? Is our end not
the same? We have another few years to live —perhaps twenty years?"
Aaron said, "That is only a few years." Then Moses brought the
number down more and more, until he spoke of the very day of death.
Immediately, Aaron's bones felt as if they were quaking. He said,
"Perhaps the davar, the word, the thing, was for me?" Moses answered,
"Yes." Immediately, the Israelites saw that his stature had shrunk, as it
is said, "The whole community saw that Aaron was about to die" [lit.,
had died] (Numbers 20:29). Then Aaron said, "My heart is dead within
me, and the terror of death has fallen upon me." Moses asked him, "Do
you accept death?" And he answered, "Yes . . ."
Moses is faced with the task that God Himself finds shameful. How to
tell Aaron of his imminent death? He approaches the subject by  
indirection, through a reading experience in the book of Genesis. In doing so, he
models for us a way of reading. He introduces his project by "calling out"
(korei) to his brother: the word is identical with the word for reading—
"Let us read in the book of Genesis." This gives us a sense that to read —
especially to read the mikra, the Bible — is to call out for response to a text
that itself calls out, summons, and addresses the reader. Essentially, to
read is to invite the text to yield up its meanings.
In this case, Moses and Aaron will read in order to find the lost devar
torah — tht word, the idea that troubled Moses during the night.
Meharher, the word I translate here as "mulling over," has connotations
of agitation; Moses recalls being uneasy over a thought, an image, a
problem from the Torah, which he now can no longer remember. He
proposes to search for it in the book of Genesis, the book of beginnings,
where the origins of all things are to be found. We have a sense that the
davar is of utter —and threatening—importance. Perhaps we should
understand that Moses has, in fact, repressed his memory of God's
mission. It is no fiction that he is presenting to Aaron, not a strategy to
communicate his brother's impending death but a real experience in
which God's word has disappeared from his memory, leaving only an
intuition that the book of Genesis will yield it back again.
There follows a poignant scene, in which Aaron enthusiastically  
endorses the narratives of creation. Clearly, he reads with his whole being,
almost comically applauding God for the beauty (yafeh assd) of His
making of the world. It is Moses who asks the dark question of death.

Introduction
Aaron at first gives the theologically correct, Job-like answer  
(reminiscent of Job's retort to his wife, "Should we accept only good from God
and not accept evil?" [Job 2:10]). In the context of the whole narrative of
creation, human sin and punishment, death has its organic place. Moses
then reads himself and Aaron into the text, making death a matter of
personal, looming, and tragic import, until Aaron reluctantly {sbema
evokes an unwilling thought) realizes, "Perhaps the word, the mystery,
the terror is for z»e?"
Moses has interrogated the text of the book of Genesis by bringing it
into the closest confrontation with the lives of Aaron and himself. He
challenges Aaron to a sense of pain and outrage at the very idea of
death — and then mobilizes his brother's acquiescence to the tragic  
narrative in a personal acceptance of death. The result of this reading of
biblical narrative is much more than the conveying of information: Aaron
not only learns of his death, but experiences its imminence, in a  
dialectical mode of fear ("his bones quaked") and acquiescence. He can contain
this tension, only because it is generated by a way of reading the Bible.
Strangely, with all the terror of such an intimate reading comes a sense of
destiny, of existing in the mind of God, of being oneself the subject of
God's word.
Such a reading—initiated and guided by Moses (our Teacher, as he is
commonly named) — is not a matter of reading personal concerns into the
text. Rather, it is a responsive summons to the meanings inherent within
the text, that await the "hearing" reader. Moses, more questioning, more
restless, is also a better reader than his brother. He is not entranced by the
words of the text, but senses what is hidden in the spaces between the
letters, in the silences between the words.
What is hidden is, essentially, the reader's most intimate life, the
things and words of the night, fears and longings and questionings. It is
these that I have tried to "hear" from within the text of the Torah.
In terms of these underlying—and often subversive—concerns, the
essay on Parshat Bereshit can be read as a kind of "preamble" to this book
and to Genesis as a whole. The belfry daydream, which represents the
vertical, distant, theoretical perspective, is opposed to the swarming,
earthbound dimension of mass human and animal life. The tension
between the two, the paradox of the human situation, cross-chained, in
Kafka's image, to both axes, throttled by one or the other chain, yields no
resolution. Kafka points up the beauty and absurdity of the human response:

Introduction
xix
"And yet all the possibilities are his, and he feels it; more, he actually refuses
to account for the deadlock by an error in the original fettering."4
The experience of highest tension, between immanence and  
transcendence, between the limits of human experience and the "signals of
transcendence" that are secreted within these limits, is what draws me in
the biblical texts and in the midrashic and later versions of those texts.
There is a sense of the turning point, the fulcrum of transformation that
affects the characters in their relations to God, to each other, and to
themselves.
Ultimately, the interpretive act becomes similar to the creative act.
One reads, and one begins to hear a certain hum in one's ears. I think of
Nadezhda MandelstanVs account of how her husband would begin to
write a new poem: "a poem begins with a musical phrase ringing  
insistently in the ears; at first inchoate, it later takes on a precise form ... I
have a feeling that verse exists before it is composed . . . The whole
process of composition is one of straining to catch and record something
compounded of harmony and sense as it is relayed from an unknown
source and gradually forms itself into words. The last stage of the work
consists in ridding the poem of all the words foreign to the harmonious
whole which existed before the poem arose."5
The hum in the ears of the reader generates a personal response to the
text. There are, of course, decorums and limits to be observed; but the
intimate encounter between self and text must create something new,
something neither "stale" nor "shabby," in Wallace Stevens's words, but
with that essential "this-ness," which is the classic midrashic description
of what it is to "receive" the Torah:
"Ow this very day, they entered the wilderness of Sinai": the words of
Torah should be new to you as though they were given this very day.
(Rashi, Exodus 19:1)
xV note to the reader
There is no doctrinaire intent in my usage in this book of the traditional
forms of reference to God as "He" nor to the use of "man" for humanity.
I am aware that these are sensitive issues, but in order to avoid stylistic
awkwardness, I have followed the JPS translation, particularly in the
"Creation" and "Flood" narratives.

GENESIS 1& The Beginning of Desire

BERESHIT W
The Pivoting Point
The mystery of creation
"We live," writes Lev Shestov, "surrounded by an endless multitude of
mysteries. But no matter how enigmatic may be the mysteries which
surround being, what is most enigmatic and disturbing is that mystery in
general exists and that we are somehow definitely and forever cut off from
the sources and beginnings of life."1
Beresbit bara Elokim: "In the beginning, God created heaven and
earth" (King James translation). Boldly and lucidly, the originating words
and acts of God are described. The narrative tells of an ordering and a
goodness that shapes all the categories of creation. Smoothly, powerfully,
and seamlessly, the text (Genesis 1:1-2, 4), through formal devices of
sequence, repetitions of key words, and the leitmotif of "Let there
be . . . and there was . . . ," produces "several theological meanings:
that Elohim, alone, 'at the beginning/ created a good ordered world; that
He 'separated\* and hierarchically ordered the primordial mass into a
'good' pattern; that the created world of nature is, as a result, a harmony;
and that Elohim is Omnipotent and without rival."2
The clarity of this account of "the sources and beginnings of life"
seems to leave no room for the existential sense of "mystery in general"
that Shestov describes. And yet Rashi, the foremost of the traditional
commentators on the Torah text, begins his great work with these words:
"This text is nothing if not mysterious" (lit., this text says nothing but
"Explain me!"). What Rashi claims, in effect, is that the opening  
sentence tells us nothing about beginnings, nothing about sequence, that it
means little more than "When God created heaven and earth. . . ."
The mystery of the beginning is based, for Rashi, on syntax: How does
the opening sentence hold together? What is the grammatical form of
the very first word? "Bereshit" is the construct form, meaning "In the
3

BERESHIT
beginning of God's creation of heaven and earth." Heaven and earth, he
argues, were not created first. "You should be ashamed of yourself" if
you try to argue that this is a chronological description of the order of
creation, for, strangely, the water appears in the second verse with no
account of its creation. So the water, it seems, is already there when the
account of beginnings begins.
What emerges from Rashi's provocative statement ("The text does
not reveal anything regarding the sequential order of creation") is a sense
of the gaps, the unexplained, the need to examine and reexamine the
apparently lucid text, with its account of a harmonious, coherent  
cosmology. There is a tension between the benevolent clarity and power of the
narrative and the acknowledgment of mystery that inheres in the very
first word and that develops as the implications of the beginning are
realized.
jfrimal disintegrations
For six days, the process of creation continues, seen from the viewpoint of
God, who speaks, sees, and names His work in its increasing complexity.
Essentially, the original binary reality of "heaven and earth" is split into
smaller binary, contrasting units: darkness and light, the lower waters and
the upper waters, seas and dry land, sun and moon. The act of havdalah,
"separation," is central. Unlike the other days of creation, which are
summed up by reference to their place in sequence —"a second day," "a
third day" —the first day is simply "one day": "And there was evening
and there was morning, one day." Rashi takes this as a reference to
primordial unity. God was alone, yahid ba'olamo. The concept of "first-
ness" would have no relevance to that day; the main business of that day
was the radical transformation of reality from the encompassing oneness
of God to the possibility of more-than-one.
Even the angels, in Rashi's narrative, are not created until the second
day. The angels play a complex and often adversarial role in the midrashic
versions of the creation narrative; this culminates in Rashi's classic  
understanding of God's decision, "Let us make man" (1:26). "We learn of the
humility of God from here. Since Man was to be in the likeness of the
angels and they would be jealous of him, He consulted them (nim-
lakh). ... He asked permission of His court."

The Pivoting Point
5
The role of the angels is to suggest a "many-ness" of viewpoints, a
spectrum of opinions, that God has to convince, placate, ultimately to
"receive permission.'' And what is God's main argument in favor of
creating humankind, in Rashi's version? "He said to the angels, 'You exist
in the upper worlds after My likeness. If there is to be no one in the lower
worlds after My likeness, then there will be jealousy among the works of
the beginning.'" In other words, God desires a proliferation of His image
in lower as well as upper worlds, a mitigation of His oneness, even, in a
sense, of His greatness. God, as it were, submits (nimlakh is the passive
form of the verb "to be king," "to rule") His greatness and seeks
permission from those smaller than He.
This imagery of consultation and proliferation is employed, as Rashi
notes, even though its associations are obviously disconcerting to a
monotheistic theology. Despite the unwelcome resonances from the
discussions and disputations that accompany creation in pagan  
mythologies, the Torah uses a plural verb to communicate a moral teaching:
"In spite of the license given to heretics by this formulation, the text does
not restrain itself from teaching the virtue of humility: the great one
should consult with, request permission from the small one. For if the text
had said, 'Let Me make man,' we should not have learned that He spoke
with His angelic court, but merely with Himself."
The text, then, according to Rashi, risks heretical interpretation, in
order to make a point of vital importance for human life. The point has to
do with the One, the Great One, who begins on Day One alone in the
Upper Worlds and then engages in an activity that apparently  
compromises His Oneness and His Greatness.
From a midrashic perspective it seems that havdalah — separation,
specialization, the formation of difference and opposition—is generally
achieved at some sacrifice. When, for instance, the lower waters are
separated from the higher waters on the second day of creation, the lower
waters are described in midrashic sources3 as weeping: "We want to be in
the presence of the King." The essential act of this second day is this act
of division: "He divided His works into different groups and reigned over
them."4 From now on, the notion of the sovereignty of God will depend
on the differences and many-ness of His subjects. But the idea of  
separation and difference has a tragic resonance: gone is the primal unity of
"God alone in His world." New possibilities, new hazards, open up. The
primary image of such separation, the division of the waters and their

6
BERESHIT
weeping expresses the yearning of the split-off parts of the cosmos for a
primordial condition of unitary being.
With division begins alienation, conflict, and yet, paradoxically, a new
notion of divine sovereignty. In this new perspective, God is recognized
as King only by that being who is most radically separated from Him.
Man, created on the sixth day, is foreshadowed by the splittings and
differentiations of matter that begin on the second day; his freedom to
perceive and to act is founded on those primal disintegrations.
ture comes into being
God's will to divide the waters is expressed in the fiat of yehi: "God said,
Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, that it may separate water
from water. . . . And it was so" (1:6-7). The word of God effectively
achieves His will: "Let there be" division, definition. Rashi quotes the
Jerusalem Talmud5 on the force of this willing word of God —yehi — "Let
there be. . . ."
"Let there be": Let the separation be strengthened. Even though the
heavens had already been created on the first day, they were still liquid.
They crystallized on the second day, in response to God's rebuke: "Let
there be 2 separation." This is what is written, "The pillars of heaven
tremble, are astounded at His rebuke" [Job, 26:11 — my translation].
All that first day, the pillars of heaven [amudei shamayim — lit., "that
which the heavens stand on"] were trembling, but on the second day,
they were astounded at His rebuke, like a man who is stunned and
frozen in place [omed— "stands still"] under the rebuke of one who
intimidates him. (Rashi, 1:6)
The Jerusalem Talmud, Rashi's source, extends the kinetic, tactile
basis of the imagery. "Rav said, 'Let there be a separation'— let the
separation strengthen, let it crystallize, let it freeze, let it consolidate."
"To be" is represented as a sort of jelling process, as the formless liquid
primary substance finds its limits in space, sohdifies, assumes its proper
form. Previously, the waters are described in Rashi's prooftext from Job
as "trembling" (yrofefu). Ibn Ezra traces the root to two sources, one
denoting weakness, the other movement. In the primary state of  
unachieved being, there is a slackness, an uncontrolled motion. (See
Ralbag's comment, too: "They move and they shudder" [Job 26:11]. In
midrashic language, the root, rqfef, is used to describe the failure of milk

to curdle—it quivers;6 the form, rifref, indicates a fluttering, vacillating
mode.7 To come into real being is to be strengthened, hardened into
specific form: "They stood in dryness and strength — like a man who is
astounded and stands [omed] in one place" (Rashi, Job 26:11).
Finding one place to stand: this is Rashi's definition of being. As we
have seen, the midrash insists that this is not achieved without tears.
Being is achieved in the cosmos by the power and terror of God's word;
"Let there be. ..." A kind of fascination takes hold of the waters:
necessity constrains them. They must be.
What I have called the jelling process in the creation of the heavens
continues in the rest of Rashi's account. The waters are "suspended in the
air" above the expanse —they "depend on the word of the King" (Rashi,
Genesis 1:7). This is the consummation of God's making (asiyah); Rashi
defines asiyah here as tikno al omdo—He fixed, completed it in its position
{al omdo—\ix..y on its stand). This stage of creation is definitively  
completed only on the third day, with the movement and containment of the
lower waters and the exposure of dry land. Only then, Rashi remarks, can
God see "goodness": the unfinished, that which has not achieved full
being, cannot be called "good."
The model of coming-to-be that is suggested by Rashi's commentary
here pictures a primary fluid stage, followed by the transformative thrill
of God's word. There is a firming, a finding of proper place, a new density
and rigor. The effect of God's word is constraint. We are close to the
notion of Necessity, as Aristotle understood it. "Cry halt before  
Necessity"— Ananke stenai. Nature cannot argue with the word of God.  
"Necessity does not allow itself to be persuaded."8 Natural phenomena can
only freeze into place, assume their necessary posture in space.
The belfry daydream
Kenneth Burke suggests that the six days of creation may be considered as
six major classifications of reality.9 The narrative translates these  
classifications into terms of temporal sequence. Man comes last, not merely in
temporal terms: he culminates, he dominates. These are the terms in
which he is conceived by God: "Let us make man, in our image, after our
likeness. They shall rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the cattle,
the whole earth, and all the creeping things that creep on the earth"
(1:26). God's first words, when He blesses man, are: "Be fertile and

8
BERESHIT
increase, fill the earth and master it; and rule the fish of the sea, the birds
of the sky, and all the living things that creep on the earth" (1:28). Man is
to rule, to dominate all categories of created reality, even those that he
cannot physically control — that is, creatures of the sea and the air, who do
not share his habitat. He is to evolve strategies to overcome physical
barriers and make himself master of nature.10
What does share his natural habitat—all animal life on earth—is
described as crawling (romesset). This is rather an unexpected use of the
term, which had answered previously to one specific form of animal life —
small, swarming creatures of water, air, and land (1:21, 24, 25). The
related term sheretz is defined by Rashi as "any living being that is not
higher than the ground— like flies, ants, beetles, worms, rats, mice and all
fish" (1:20). Rashi's definition seems to consist of the height criterion
only. Yet a few lines later, he adds another factor, to define remess: "insects
that are low, crawling on the ground, and look as though they are being
dragged, because their movement is not clearly perceived,, (1:24). There
is a quality of movement that characterizes the remess—sheretz, as well as a
quality of height— "not higher than the earth." This is an unwilled,
unindividuated movement—these creatures move in crowds, driven by
instinct. They wheel and swerve in a way that is perceived by man as
irrational. The word remess is strangely used, then, to describe all animal
life on earth. It is as though Man is conceived of as towering physically
over all animal life.
This conception, which is inherent in the blessing of domination, is
figured by an image of verticality. In The Poetics of Space, Gaston Bache-
lard, the French philosopher of art, writes of what he calls "belfry
daydreams," in which one watches others "running about . . .
irrationally, like ants . . . the size of flies." This is a "dream of high
solitude"; the dreamer enjoys "an impression of domination at little
cost. . . . From the top of his tower, a philosopher of domination sees the
universe in miniature. Everything is small because he is so high. And
since he is high, he is great, the height of his station is proof of his own
greatness."11
The insistence of the Creation narrative on man as vertical (high,
therefore great) comes always in a context of horizontal spread: "Be
fertile and increase, fill the earth and master it; and rule" (1:28).12 The
blessing of fertility, the instinct of what Elias Canetti calls the "increase
pack" ("to be more"), is first given to fish, fowl, and animal life (1:22;

The Pivoting Point
9
8:17). To proliferate is, in a sense, the sheretz modality, as Ramban,
following on the Targum, translates the term (1:20).
Here is Canetti's account of the phenomenology of the increase pack:
Characteristic of the pack is the fact that it cannot grow. It is  
surrounded by emptiness and there are literally no additional people who
could join it. It consists of a group of men in a state of excitement whose
fiercest wish is to be more. . . . Density within the pack is always  
something of an illusion. Men may press closely together and enact a
multitude in traditional rhythmic movements, but they are not a  
multitude; they are a few, and have to make up in intensity what they lack in
actual numbers.13
Canetti's reading of the pack phenomenon is informed by the despair
and vulnerability of the few fevered by the desire to be more. When God
blesses Adam and Eve, or commands Noah and his few survivors after the
Flood, the imperative of density—"to be more,, — is poignantly  
recognized: "Fill the earth. . . . abound on the earth [lit., swarm] and increase
on it" (9:7). Surrounded by emptiness, man seeks the animal faculty of
increase. What man is blessed-commanded to do is not simply to  
propagate; the process is one, in Canetti's terms, of transformation:
Early man, roaming about in small bands through large and often
empty spaces, was confronted by a preponderance of animals . . .
Many of them existed in enormous numbers. Whether it was herds of
buffaloes or springboks, shoals of fish, or swarms of locusts, bees
or ants, their numbers rendered those of man insignificant.
For the progeny of man is sparse, coming singly and taking a long
time to arrive. The desire to be more, for the number of people to
whom one belongs to be larger, must always have been profound and
urgent, and must, moreover, have been growing stronger all the
time. . . . Man's weakness lay in the smallness of his numbers. ... In
the enormously long period of the time during which he lived in small
groups, he, as it were, incorporated into himself, by transformations, all
the animals he knew. It was through the development of  
transformation that he really became man; it was his specific gift and pleasure.14
Canetti goes on to discuss the rites of the Australian aborigines, whose
ancestors are treated as having a dual nature, both animal and human at
once. Each ancestor embodies a particular animal as part of his being.
These Canetti sees as products of transformation. A successful and
established transformation became a kind of endowment: it signified a

10
BERESHIT
connection with the numbers of the animals incorporated into the human
identity. Man desired the increase of the animals, since they were  
connected with man: "When they increased, he also increased; the increase
of the totem animal was identical with his own." Plants, as well as animals,
even insects, scorpions, lice, flies or mosquitoes can be designated as a
totem: "it can only be their immense number which attracts them; in
establishing a relationship with them he means to ensure their numbers
for himself."15
Canetti's model of the increase pack and the process of  
"transformation" that achieves the desired animal numerousness provides us with a
way of reading the connection in the Creation narrative between increase
and domination. For man is told in the same breath that he is to  
proliferate and to rule. His motion is to be swarmlike, horizontal, attached to
the earth, and to necessity, blindly following the instinct to be more, to
fill the emptiness; and, equally, it is to be Godlike, concentrated, vertical,
affirming an all encompassing vision of the world. As in the belfry
daydream described by Bachelard, part of the human experience is the
"dream of high solitude. . . . From the top of his tower, a philosopher of
domination sees the universe in miniature."16

### The vertical and the horizontal

Here is an essential paradox of the human, as God conceives, blesses, and commands His culminating creation: he is to live on the horizontal and vertical plane at once. He is to transform himself into a creature preoccupied with swarming, proliferation, incorporating the strength of the animal world. He is at the same time to rule, to conquer. Rashi's comment
here is evocative: the word for "rule," ve-yirdu, can be read as a play on the alternative meanings of "rule" and "descent." "If he merits, he will dominate [_rodeh_] the animal world, if he does not merit, he will become law _yarood_ before them and they will dominate him" (1:26). The necessity for a kind of philosophical detachment, the solitude of higher and larger
perspectives, creates an implicit tension with the imperative blessing of increase. To spread over the earth, to fill the earth, to know the urgent rhythmic passion of increase is to be invested in the immediate, the experienced, the contingent.

It is in these terms that we can read God's final statement of disappointment at the outcome of the human creature:

> When men began to increase on earth and daughters were born to them, the divine beings saw how beautiful the daughters of men were and took wives among those that pleased them. The Lord said, "My breath shall not abide in man forever, since he too is flesh; let the days allowed him be one hundred and twenty years." It was then, and later, too, that the Nephilim appeared on earth—when the divine beings cohabited with the daughters of men, who bore them offspring. They were the heroes of old, the men of renown. (6:1-4) Here are the themes of giant size and increase over the face of the earth. But some essential misarticulation affects these two modalities. In the midrashic accounts, the Nephilim are giants who wear the sun around their necks,17 their heads disappear into the heavens, they command the rainfall—and, in accordance with their name, they "fall and bring the world down with them,, (Rashi, 6:4). The monstrous excess of the vertical leads to a shattering destruction.

Many centuries later, as the Israelites roam the wilderness, they send spies to the Holy Land. The spies return with eyewitness reports of giants: "All the people that we saw in it are men of great size; we saw the Nephilim there — the Anakites are part of the Nephilim—and we looked like grasshoppers to ourselves, and so we must have looked to them" (Numbers 13:32-33). There, too, the two modalities are disastrously polarized. The spies are filled with awe before the invulnerable, the vertical; they sense themselves as humiliated at their own grasshopper dimensions, their _sheretz_ reality.[^18] This splitting-off, the incapacity to bear the tension of their own equivocal existence, leads to a real despair, an acceptance of the lowest human profile —"And so we were in their eyes" (Numbers 13:33). The spies see themselves reflected in the eyes of the fantasy giants: an intimate vision of self is corroborated at every turn. The catastrophe of the narrative of the spies is conveyed through the imagery of "falling." They complain of a destiny, in which any claim to vertical stature will be doomed ("Why is the Lord taking us to that land to fall by the sword?" [Numbers:3]). Moses "falls on his face" (Numbers 14:5) in despair. And God decrees, "In this very wilderness shall your carcasses drop. . . . But your carcasses shall drop in the wilderness... until the last of your carcasses is down in the wilderness" (14:29, 32, 33). In the words of Midrash Ylamdenu: "The spies fell to the ground [in hysterical fits]&mdash;they would stand on their feet and make themselves collapse in front of their families" (14:3).

The narrative of the spies is one of failure to contain a radical tension. The vertical being is assailed by the vertigo of his dual nature. His origin and ultimate destiny are in the earth, the issues of fertility, increase, and survival dominate his experience. And yet he knows himself invested with a singular Godlike power. From his vantage point, he can see immense perspectives, come to conclusions far beyond the contingencies of the moment; yet he is a participant in the driven, spawning multitudes he can observe so splendidly from his metaphysical solitude. This is the essential dilemma of man, as God conceives of him, blesses
him, and charges him with imperative of his duality. How to deal with the unthinking conformity of the increase pack, the vision of men as "bugs, spawn, as a mob"? These are Emerson's terms, in "Self-Reliance," which Stanley Cavell calls a "study of shame": "How do we, as Emerson puts it, 'come out' of that? How do we become self-reliant? The worst thing we
could do is rely on ourselves as we stand — this is simply to be slaves of our slavishness: it is what makes us spawn. We must . . . transform our conformity."[^19]

The problem is implicit in the blessing: we are to spawn, and we are to rise upwards. Hamlet has his tortured view of the dilemma: "Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were
better my mother had not borne me. . . . What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven?"[^20]

To breed, to crawl, these are the acts of the _sheretz_. At one pole of failure, the midrash imagines men as grasshoppers, who compulsively "climb up and fall back down" into their jar, are incapable of learning from experience.[^21] To be trapped in the reality of "crawling between earth and heaven" is to be doomed to repeat irrational patterns of the pack, the rhythmic movements generated by the blind urge simply "to be more." And, on the other hand, there is the "terror of standing upright," which Kafka describes in one of his letters to Felice, responding to a dream of hers: "Had you not been lying on the ground among the animals, you would have been unable to see the sky and the stars and wouldn't have been set free. Perhaps you wouldn't have survived the terror of standing upright. I feel much the same; it is a mutual dream you have dreamed for us both."[^22] There is a violence, even a guilt, inherent in the posture of greatness, of power. Kafka expresses the dream conviction that to lower one's profile is to preserve innocence and, perhaps, even to see more of the sky.

### Greatness and procreativeness

The paradox of the vertical and the horizontal is fleshed out in the midrashic narratives of Creation. Two things are called "great" in the Biblical text: the lights ("God made the two great lights, the greater light to dominate the day and the lesser light to dominate the night, and the stars" [1:16]) and the great sea monsters (1:21). The lights are great, and
they dominate: the two concepts clearly cohere. But in both cases, the lights and the sea monsters, the midrash opens up tantalizing perspectives on the problematics of greatness.
Responding to the apparent textual contradiction&mdash;both lights are great? Only one is great?&mdash;and the defective spelling of _me'orot_ (lights), the midrash deciphers a hidden narrative: "They were created equal, but the moon was diminished, because she complained, 'It is impossible for two kings to wear one crown'" (Rashi, 1:16). The moon knows that inherent in the idea of greatness is singularity. Two cannot be called great, since to be great is by definition to dominate, to loom over, to see a world from a unique perspective. In Rashi's source, therefore, God tells the moon, "Diminish yourself."[^23] Here is a voluntary act of  
self-diminishing, an acceptance of the small rather than the great role, which is compensated for by the many hosts of stars that will now accompany the moon.

Maharal, in fact, offers an arresting reading of "diminishment": the moon becomes, not smaller, but a being capable of waning&mdash;to the point where the sun remains truly alone&mdash;that is, truly great&mdash;in the sky.[^24] The moon yields up her eternal and transcendent being and accepts a role of contingency, mutability, and proliferation. There is a powerful suggestion of a relation between greatness and solitude, on the one hand, and
smallness and increase, on the other. The moon experiences both loss and gain.

The sea monsters, too, are great; they, too, are spelled defectively (the plural indication lacks a _yod_). This is Rashi's version of the midrashic tradition: "This is the Leviathan and its mate. God created them male and female, and killed the female and salted it away for the righteous in the world to come. For if they had been fertile and increased, the world could not have survived in their presence" (1:21). (In the midrashic source, the male Leviathan is castrated to ensure that its destructive powers of procreation&mdash;or even of sexual relations&mdash;are totally neutralized).[^25]

In this extraordinary midrash, what commands our attention once again is the theme of greatness and solitude. To have a partner, while remaining in the mode of greatness, is an existential impossibility. The world as we know it would cease to exist. Only in the world-to-come, in a different (and presumably richer) version of reality can the righteous
flourish on the free play of greatness and procreativeness.

### The problem of man

All this is a preamble to the problem of man. Although he is to dominate creation, Man is not called "great," because he is, from the very outset, to be many. ("Be fertile and increase . . ." [1:28].) Yet there is ambiguity in the account of his origins. He was formed from the clay of dust and water, of earth and heaven, in one whole "image of God"; yet immediately, he is
described as a plural being: "And God created man in His image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them" (1:27).26 The narrative later describes the removal of one of his ribs to make woman. And the midrash, in Rashi's version, resolves the question
of unity and duality in one striking image: "God created him first with two faces, and separated them" (1:27).

One of Rashi's sources narrates a previous stage of the process, which Rashi does not quote: "At first, God intended to create two separate beings, but in the end man was created as one being."[^27] God's first thought represents an ideal reality. The decision to create man as one
androgynous being ("in the image of God He created him") then seems inscrutable, especially since there is an almost immediate return to the original plan: man is split into the two entities of God's first intention ("male and female He created them"). The splitting-off is prefaced by a thought of God: a soliloquy&mdash;perhaps the first "God said" that has no
direct effect on reality. God thinks: "It is not good for man to be alone; I will make a fitting helper for him" (2:18). Rashi comments: "So that people should not say, 'There are two powers; God is alone in the upper worlds, and has no partner, and this one is in the lower worlds, without a partner.'"

The association of aloneness with power, greatness, is clear here. To have a _ben zug_, an equivalent Other, with whom one must reckon, who limits the grandeur of one's solitude, with whom one speaks and struggles and brings offspring into the world&mdash;all this is the very definition of the not Godly, the not great. One who has a _ben zug_ is yoked to contingency,
lives on the horizontal plane, whose blessing and imperative is increase. God is without a _ben zug_; angels are not fertile and do not increase&mdash;unlike men, animals, and demons (who share also the facts that they eat, drink, defecate, and die!);[^28] the Leviathan is deprived, for the duration of present time, of his partner; the Sabbath has no _ben zug_ and complains as the other days of the week pair themselves offmdash;in the end, God matches
her, matchless as she is, with Israel; the tribe of Dan is described as a lonely, independent warrior&mdash;"as one of the tribes of Israel" (49:16): "like the solitary One of Israel who needs no help in war," and his emblem is the snake, who goes alone: "All the beasts walk in pairs, while the snake travels alone."[^29] "God said to Israel, All that I have created, I created in pairs: heaven and earth, the sun and the moon, Adam and Eve, this world and the next. But My glory is One and unmatched in the world."[^30] In view of all this, man's aloneness is "not good": it lends itself to a misconception about the nature of man. What he requires is a "fitting helper." This arresting description (lit., a help against him) draws an
equally arresting comment from Ramban: it was important to realize man as two matched creatures, rather than as one androgynous being (even if he were capable of procreation), because "God saw that it was good that his helpmate should stand in front of him [kenegdo, translated here as "fitting," has confrontational implications], so that he may see her, and separate from her, and unite with her, according to his will" (Ramban, 2:18). For Ramban, man as alone and autonomous is "not good," because he would live a static, unchanging, and unwilled life. Man needs to live face-to-face with the Other, dancing to the choreography of
his own freedom.

The splitting-off of man is, however, achieved not by the pure word of God. This remains "private," a reminder to the reader that God's original idea of the human good has not yet been implemented. It is achieved only when man himself comes to recognize the pains of solitude. Only after he has named the animals does the text insert into Adam's consciousness the search for the Other: "And the man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to all the wild beasts; but for Adam no fitting helper was found" (2:20). Who was it who sought and could not find? The midrash fills the gap. Rashi says, "When God brought the animals to Adam, He brought each species in pairs, male and female. Adam said, They all have a ben zug, a partner. Only I have no partner. Immediately, he fell asleep."

The powerful implication here is that God's original intention can be consummated only by Adam's free perception and desire. Only when Adam comes to feel the solitude of the angelic, unitary existence is he split into two separate beings. He must, in a sense, diminish himself,
come to know the Tightness of a more complex form of unity. That is, God sets aside His original vision, creates man alone and great, complete in himself&mdash;a plausible version of the human reality, but one that will be undermined by the restless experience of "be could not find a fitting help" (literal translation of _lo matza_). "Not to find" is the purpose of man's lone creation. He knows in his pain and searching both that "For my sake the whole world was created"[^31]&mdash;he dreams of belfries, and of "monuments of unaging intellect"&mdash;and that his humanity requires the "sensual music"[^32] of horizontal relationship, the fusing and parting, the changing reflections of face meeting face.

Man's greatness, therefore, his creation in the image of God, his dominating the sensual swarming landscape, locks in an inescapable tension with his participation in that world of proliferation and change, of waxing and waning. He is attached to two mutually exclusive ways of being, called in the shorthand of the midrash "the upper worlds" and "the lower worlds."
In his creation, for the first time, the word _vayyitzer_ is used — "He formed mzn from the dust of the earth" (2:7). The doubling of _yod_ in _vayyitzer_ suggests the surplus of possible meanings and identifications that man is endowed with. Unlike the cattle, which "do not stand to be judged" (Rashi, 2:7)&mdash;that is, which are not accountable for the choices
and conflicts inherent in a paradoxical existence&mdash;man is formed both of the dust of the whole earth (the four corners of the earth), so that he will be accepted for burial in whatever part of the globe he dies, and of the dust of the sacred center, Jerusalem: "God took his dust from the place of which it is said, 'You shall make an altar of earth for Me&mdash;I wish that he may gain atonement, and that he may be able to stand''" (Rashi, 2:7).

There is a striking pathos in God's wish for man: "Halevai!—Would that it might be so!" The difficulty of man's situation is focused here: the material of his body (only at the next stage, God animates him with His spirit-breath) comes both from the four corners of the earth, from all the instincts and processes of the horizontal, from the dust into which he will
disappear, and from the place of unity, the sacred spot of original creation, the axis mundi, where this world intersects with the higher worlds.

There is an "opposition between space that is sacred&mdash;the only real and real-ly existing space&mdash;and all other space, the formless expanse surrounding it."[^33] And man, in the midrashic view, is the meeting point of the two kinds of dust, of the one and the many. The Talmud puns on the agony of the dilemma: "Woe to me, because of the One who formed me [_yotzri_]. Woe to me, because of my unruly desires [_yitzri_]. In the very fibers of his being, he belongs to both dimensions at once.

Kafka expresses a similar torment of irresolubility:

> He is a free and secure citizen of the world, for he is fettered to a chain which is long enough to give him the freedom of all earthly space, and only so long that nothing can drag him past the frontiers of the world. But simultaneously he is a free and secure citizen of Heaven as well, for he is also fettered by a similarly designed heavenly chain. So that if he heads, say, for the earth, his heavenly collar throttles him, and if he heads for Heaven, his earthly one does the same. And yet all the possibilities are his, and he feels it; more, he actually refuses to account for the deadlock by an error in the original fettering.[^35]

Man is chained to incompatible universes of being; and yet within his chains he feels unaccountably that all the possibilities are his. There is no error; yet he cannot live comfortably in either heaven or earth, while he is a "free and secure citizen" of both.

### The hands of God

The two sources for human dust are given, in Rashi's version, as  
alternatives. But, in a source midrash, the two are aligned into one narrative: in
the first hour of the sixth day of creation, God gathered dust for man; in
the second hour, He molded him in a pure place, at the very umbilicus of
the world, the Holy Temple in Jerusalem.36 That is, man has his origins in
both kinds of space, in the dust of the Many and the One.
But here it is the image of molding man that is arresting. Man alone in
creation is described as formed out of a clammy combination of earth and

18
BERESHIT
water. "A flow would well up from the ground and water the whole
surface of the earth" (2:6). Rashi comments: "For the purpose of creating
man, the depths released a vapor that seeded the clouds and moistened
the dust, so that man was created—like this baker, who adds water to his
dough and then kneads it! So here, first there was a moistening and then,
'God formed man.'"
The audacity of the image is reinforced by another comment of Rashi:
" 'And God created man in His image': Everything else was created by an
act of speech; only man was created with the hands of God, as it is said, 'You
placed Your hands upon me'" (Psalms 139:5) (1:27).
There is an imagining here that cannot be glibly dismissed under the
rubric of anthropomorphism. What does it mean, to be created by the
hands of God, rather than by His word— (" 'Let there be an expanse in
the midst of the water'")? Man comes to be differently, it seems. Even
before God breathes the breath of life into him, the circumstances of his
physical making are radically different. It is no longer a matter of the
water's swarming spontaneously with new life (1:20), or of the earth's
"bringing forth" animal life (1:24), in response to God's word, " 'Let it
be. . . .' "3? As we noticed before, the creative fiat induces a spasm of
realization of new forms in the rest of nature. There, God's word is all-
powerful: it constrains chaotic possibilities into the desired shape and
posture. In such a hegemony of the word, it would be absurd to conceive
of rebellion, or even of dialogue: "Necessity does not allow itself to be
persuaded."38
Quite different is the imagery of the potter and his clay (or the baker
and his dough). For here, the midrash dares to make a statement about
the Frankensteinian nature of all creation. True, the potter has total
control of his material. As in the famous image in Jeremiah 18, "if the
vessel he was making with clay in the potter's hands was spoiled, he would
make it into another vessel, such as the potter saw fit to make" (18:4).
Like God, the potter "sees" and "makes." But there is another truth in
the relationship of potter and clay:
Then the word of the Lord came to me: O House of Israel, can I not
deal with you like this potter? says the Lord. Just like clay in the hands
of the potter, so are you in My hands, O House of Israel! At one
moment I may decree that a nation or a kingdom shall be uprooted and
pulled down and destroyed; but if that nation against which I made the
decree turns back from its wickedness, I change My mind [venihamti]

concerning the punishment I planned to bring on it. At another
moment I may decree that a nation or a kingdom shall be built and
planted; but if it does what is displeasing to Me and does not obey Me,
then I change My mind [venihamti] concerning the good I planned to
bestow upon it. (Jeremiah 18:5-10)
Here is surprise, rather than the inevitability of God's power. In all
creative work (the word la'asot, "to make," is central in this passage),
there is play between the artist and his material. The characters of the
novel begin to talk back, to declare their own reality and destiny. Thomas
Mann intended his Joseph cycle to be a short story: it grew into a long
novel that took ten years to complete. Edward Hopper says that for him
painting is about a vision, yet when he makes a painting he reluctantly
surrenders the vision to what he has made.39 Erich Neumann writes of
the "autonomy of the unconscious": the artist lives within the tension
created by his consciousness and the unconscious that "often breaks
through with a 'will of its own,' which by no means coincides with the will
of the artist."40 This tension in the experience of the creative person is
precisely evoked by the passage in Jeremiah, and by the midrashic image
of the baker kneading his dough. For God indeed "diminishes" His
solitude and His power in order to create man. He responds to man's
autonomous motions, to his "turning back," with a "change of mind":
the spirit of re-creation which masters this earthly form
loves most the pivoting point where you are no longer yourself.41
Ambiguities of independence
In the Creation narrative, God "changes His mind" about the work of
His hands —and destroys the world. Just before the Flood, "the Lord
regretted [va-yenahem] that He had made man on earth, and His heart
was saddened" (6:6). The anthropomorphism here is most poignant: but
it is an organic outgrowth of the imagery of the artist, who projects but
cannot control this one part of his work that is made ba-yadayim — "wixh
His hands." Rashi's comment makes the connection clear. What is the
meaning of va-yitatzev (translated here as "He was saddened")? "He
mourned the loss of the work of His hands." There is a relation of the
hands to the work, which is the contrary of everything abstract and
detached. It is the relation of loving involvement, the mutual  
vulnerability to surprise and failure, the power and the risk of making.

20
BERESHIT
When Adam sins, God's response, according to the midrash, is not
verbal; rather "He laid His hand upon him and diminished him."42 God
"mourns for the loss of the work of His hands." Rashi's translation of va-
yitatzev (6:6) is precisely related to the meanings that Rashi attributes to
the word etzev (translated here as "sadness") where it first appears, in
God's response to Eve's sin: "I will make most severe your pangs in
childbearing [itzvonekh]" (3:16). Rashi veers away from this obvious
meaning of itzavon ("pain of childbearing") and quotes the Talmud:
"This refers to the pain of bringing up children."43
One might say that the difficulty in rearing children has to do with the
ambiguities of independence. The child must separate from the parent;
the parent must allow the child to discover his or her own reality. Where
there was one, there must be two. But this separation, though necessary,
is a complex and often tormented experience. The relationship between
separation and loving attachment has to be negotiated each time afresh.
There is no theory that can totally guide the parent or the artist. No
belfry can house this kind of experience. In the act of creation, there is
perhaps inevitable sadness, as the work works itself loose from the
vision.44
The original verb, vayyitzer— "And He formed [man]" (2:7)  
—expresses this mystery of formation, of transformation. Wherever hands are
involved, wherever there are "les traces des mains," even in the kneading
of dough, there is the surprise of becoming: the viscous mixture of flour
and water becomes the fragrant loaf of bread, the clay of dust and water
becomes man. And it is this mystery, of how man becomes real, that is
central to the midrashic vision of the narrative.
Standing upright
At this point, I would like to quote a passage from Nine Talmudic Readings,
by Emmanuel Levinas. He describes his approach to those rabbinical
sources in which the psychology and intentionality of God are central.
My effort always consists in extricating from this theological language
meanings addressing themselves to reason. . . . [This] consists, first of
all, in a mistrust of everything in the texts studied that could pass for a
piece of information about God's life, for a theosophy; it consists in
being preoccupied, in the face of each of these apparent news items
about the beyond, with what this information can mean in and for
man's life.45

The Pivoting Point
21
If we are to speak of God's sadness, of His restraint in listening to and
observing the freedom of man, of His frustration and sense of mourning,
and, above all, if we are to unpack the imagery of God's hands, making
and unmaking, molding and reducing man, then our effort will be toward
an understanding of what this "can mean in and for man's life." Man
knows himself created and freed from constraint. He feels himself as full
of possibilities, and yet mysteriously cross-chained. He has had God's
hands upon him; they created him whole, and he struggles to free himself
from their total hold.
Like the child, like the vessel, he must find a space of separateness, in
order to be; but to separate from God is to cut the ground of being from
under his feet. For however one understands the nature of the sin that
turns Adam and Eve out of Eden, its effect is to undermine their standing
in the world. The tension between the vertical and the horizontal was
once successfully accommodated by Adam and Eve. They could hold
their ground in the presence of God. This, essentially, is the meaning of
being— kiyyum: to rise up (la-koom), to be tall (koma zekufa) in the
presence of God. To be banished from the Garden is to lose a particular
standing ground.
To be banished, as Cain is later much more totally banished, is to have
the earth cursed under one's feet: "You have banished me this day from
the soil, and I must avoid Your presence and become a restless wanderer
on earth" (4:14). Cain's connection with the earth is disrupted. Ramban
emphasizes that restlessness is an inner quality of Cain's being, an
essential character of his "curse": "His heart will not rest nor be quiet
enough to stand in one place." Cain's protest focuses on this subjective
torment: "Since I am to be a restless wanderer, I can not stand in one
place —xhzt is what banishment from the soil means —I have no place of
rest. 'And I must avoid Your presence' — for I cannot stand before You to
pray." In Ramban's reading, prayer, or sacrifice, is a profound expression
of the existential stance of man-in-the-presence-of-God, able to hold
ground and rise vertically, between earth and heaven.
In this context, the motif of Adam's "standing" acquires great  
resonance in midrashic sources. One of the essential stages of his creation,
which is charted over the course of the hours of the sixth day, is when God
"stood him on his legs."46 This is Adam's first experience, after God has
filled him with the breath of life—an experience of "standing on his legs":

22
BERESHIT
He looked upwards and downwards, and his stature [komato] extended
from one end of the world to the other . . . and he saw all God's
creatures. He began to glorify his Creator's name, saying, "How many
are Your works, O God!" He stood on his legs and looked like one made
in the image of God. The creatures saw him and were afraid, thinking
that he had created them. So they all came to worship him. He said to
them: "You have come to worship me. Come, you and I, let us go and
put on clothing of majesty and strength and make Him King over us,
who created us all." So then Adam went by himself and was the first to
make God King. And all the creatures followed him, while he said,
"God reigns: He is clothed in majesty." (Psalms 93:1)
The imagery in this passage is potent with paradox. Adam stands on
his legs; and his stature {komato —as in English, the words "stature" and
"stand," are related) extends from one end of the world to the other.
Because of his height, he can see both vertically and horizontally, to the
full extent of empirical reality. There is, in fact, an ambiguity about the
"end-to-end" image: whether it indicates a horizontal grasp of the world
or an earth-heaven range.47 But clearly, Adam is depicted as possessing
both powers, and the meaning of his stature is that he can see to the full
extent of both planes, the vertical and the horizontal. That is, unlike
Kafka's dreamer, lying on the ground in a refusal of the erect position (the
"terror of standing upright"), Adam occupies a vantage point from which
he sees not only the stars, but all created beings on earth. He can see
downwards as well as upwards, he is rooted in a reality which he can
perceive and map.
Nothing is said to indicate that he sees the animals as minuscule, but
clearly they see him as awesome in his verticality. They assume, indeed,
that he is their creator. That is, man knows himself as conspicuous, self-
conscious, not an indigenous part of the world of nature. There is danger
and fear in the loneliness of this position, the hazard of hubris. For what
the animals perceive is something truly Godlike. In standing, he is the
equivalent, in the lower world, of the angels. Sardonically, Canetti writes:
"We always overrate the man who stands upright. . . . Because standing
is . . . the antecedent of all motion, a standing man creates an impression
of energy which is as yet unused."48 The reserves of possibility signified
by the standing position may be something of an illusion, Canetti  
suggests. We see Adam's godlikeness, here, from the viewpoint of the
adoring animals.

The Pivoting Point
23
But the authentic greatness of Adam emerges in his response. He
abandons his belfry grandeur and proclaims a common identity with the
animals as created beings who owe adoration to an invisible Creator. And
he does this in no obsequious humility but in a paradoxical perception
that "to stand in the presence of God" is precisely to achieve full "majesty
and strength." In voluntary acknowledgment, firstly of the vast gamut of
created life ("How many are Your works, O God!") and then of the
ultimate coherence under God of this "pied beauty," Adam becomes
most Godlike. He makes common cause with the animals (lit., I and you,
let us go put on majesty), but he, in fact, goes first and alone.
The paradox consists of Adam's diminishing himself— surrendering a
speciously Godlike role and assuming an authentic one. The paradigm
for this is the enigmatic rabbinic statement: "Wherever you find the
greatness of God, there you find His humility." 49 Power and humility are
both implicit in this vision of Adam standing in the presence of God:
"man in his wholeness wholly attending."
This is a posture that he does not hold for long, however. It is striking
that midrashic accounts of the sin that deforms his posture are so often
cast in the imagery of the "incapacity to stand." We have already noticed
the wistful tone of God's wish: Halevai— "Would that he might be
created from the place of the altar and have standing."50 Before the sin,
Adam could "hear God speaking and stand on his legs ... he could
withstand it."51 After the sin, he hides; the midrash imagines Adam and
Eve as shrinking, essentially pretending not to be.52 In another midrash,
God says, "Woe Adam! Could you not stand in your commandment for
even one hour? Look at your children who can wait three years for the
fruit tree to pass its forbidden stage [orlah]"5\* This is a strange analogy:
the capacity to wait seems to be the issue here, to hold ground, in spite of
tensions of various kinds.
Another version of the same image is found in Shemot Rabbah. God
reproaches the Israelites after the sin of the Golden Calf: like Adam, the
people were destined to live for ever, but "when they said, 'These are your
gods, O Israel!,' death came upon them. God said, 'You have followed the
system of Adam, who did not stand the pressure of his testing for three
hours. . . .' 'I said, "You are gods. . . ." But you went in the ways of
Adam,' so 'indeed like Adam you shall die. And like one of the princes you
shall fall' (Psalms 82:6-7)—you have brought yourselves low."54

24
BERESHIT
The midrash uses the imagery of the Fall, with a perfect consistency.
The sin, as such, is not mentioned. Instead, what Adam, and again the
Israelites, represents is a kind of spinelessness, a vapidity. A splendid
being decomposes before our eyes. The word that is used in Sanhedrin
38b to describe the sin is sarab> which implies exactly this aesthetic
offensiveness: it holds nuances of evaporation, loss of substance, and the
offensive odor of mortification. "O my offense is rank, it smells to
heaven."55 It signifies a failure to stand in the presence of God, to
maintain the posture of eternal life. "You have brought yourselves low":
man, the midrash boldly implies, does not really want full and eternal
being. He chooses death, lessened being. What looks like defiance is an
abandonment of a difficult posture.
In connection with this notion of flight from the demands of reality,
there is an evocative sentence in the Vilna Gaon's reading of the story of
Jonah. The central enigma of that story is the act that initiates the plot:
Jonah flees from the presence of God. Much ink has been spilled on the
theological absurdity of such a flight. The Gaon says simply: "Everyone
flees from the presence of God; no one wants to stand in His presence."56
In this allegorical reading, Jonah is Everyman, protesting at the  
paradoxical demands of his condition. "To stand in the presence of God" is to
resist the temptations of flight, to bear the tensions of freedom and
obedience, of a position where vertical and horizontal axes meet. No one,
says the Gaon, chooses to be; it is normal to decompose, to evade the
demands of a whole consciousness. Unlike the phenomena of nature,
man cannot be shocked into being, by fear, by Necessity, by the fiat of
God. His is a more complicated story. It is the story of the quest for
amidaby for a solid reality on which to base his life. Adam could not hold
his position long: "things fall apart; the center cannot hold."57 And in his
failure to be, the whole world loses solid specification.
suspension of being
Here we approach the heart of the matter, an important, much-quoted
midrash in which the narrative of Creation is undone, as it were, by the
failure of Adam to stand. At the very end of the saga of Creation, just
before the Sabbath (and therefore after Adam has begun to "evaporate"),
the Torah says, "And God saw all that He had made and found it very
good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day"

The Pivoting Point
25
(1:31). God reviews a work of art that now includes failure and death, and
calls it— as never before — very good.58 But the midrash that Rashi quotes,
in his commentary on the verse, gives us a sense of a world not really
created at all:
"The sixth day": the definite article [heh] is added here [compare the
conclusion of each of the previous days of creation—a second day, a
third day] to teach that God had made a condition with all the works of
the beginning, depending on Israel's acceptance of the Five [the
numerical value of heh] Books of the Torah. Another reading: All the
works of the beginning are suspended [lit., hanging and standing] until
the sixth day of Sivan, which is destined for the Giving of the Torah.
Before we confront this midrash, however, the Torah text itself should
provoke us to uneasiness. Why is the totality of things very good, since it
now implicitly includes exile and shame, the flattening and dulling of the
human body and face. " 'And God banished him from the Garden of
Eden': his stature was diminished, his light was dimmed, his food changed,
he became a restless wanderer on the earth, and death was inflicted on
him and on all generations to the end of time."59 Some essential light has
faded from man's face; his range of vision is stunted. Job cries to God
about the hopelessness of man's fate: "You overpower him for ever and he
perishes; You alter his visage and dispatch him" (Job 14:20). "You
dispatch him" — va-tishalhehu—the same word used for Adam's  
banishment from Eden—holds a terror of summary execution. The banishment
of man is interwoven with his mortality; it is to be read in his face, in his
body. He knows himself unable to stand where he stood before. Is this
change irreversible, as Job asserts? And in what sense is this "very good"?
One suggestion is that banishment is a merciful alternative to the
finality of immediate death, which was, indeed, the apparent punishment
that God had decreed originally: "on the day that you eat of it, you shall
die" (2:17). Instead of dying on the very day of his fall, he is punished with
exile; he lives on for nine hundred and thirty years. "If it were not for
Your mercy, Adam would have had no standing (amidab)."60 The simplest
reading of "standing" would be "survival." But, implicitly, both Adam
and the world are in need of some Archimedean point of stability, in a
situation in which disintegration threatens. Here, the Archimedean point
is defined as the "mercy of exile"; in another midrashic text, it is called
the "strength of the Sabbath, without which the world could not have

26
BERESHIT
stood."61 The main question facing man from now on will be precisely
this quest for a foundation of being, for "one thing only which is certain
and indubitable."62
Man sets off on a journey in which no form of solid assurance of reality
and sanity accompanies him. In Descartes's vision of this radical anxiety,
the ultimate dread is of madness, the fear of waking from a self-deceptive
dream world, of having "all of a sudden fallen into very deep waters,"
where "I can neither make certain of setting my feet on the bottom, nor
can I swim and so support myself on the surface."
The instability, the tendency of the world to change, to wear out, to
fall apart, will lead the descendants of Adam to beliefs and rituals whose
common aim is to make the world strong and solid again. Mircea Eliade
narrates many such rituals of renewal, which reenact the creation, the
original encounter of God and the world, and thus "repair" or "fix" the
world:
In Kimberley, the rock paintings, which are believed to have been
painted by the Ancestors, are repainted in order to reactivate their
creative force, as it was first manifested in mythical times, that is, at the
beginning of the World. . . . Among some Yurok tribes the  
strengthening of the World is accomplished by ritually rebuilding the steam
cabin. . . . [The priest] climbs a mountain. There he finds a branch,
which he makes into a walking stick, saying: "This world is cracked, but
when I pick up and drag the stick, all the cracks will fill up and the earth
will become solid again." Going down to the river, he finds a stone,
which he sets solidly in place, saying: "The earth, which has been
tipped, will be straight again. People will live to be stronger." He sits
down on the stone. "When I sit on the stone . . . the earth will never get
up and tip again." The stone has been there since the time of the
Immortals, that is since the beginning of the World.63
Eliade's notion of the continual or recurrent need to participate in the
original "right" creation of the world is one response to a common
existential anguish. The response described in classic talmudic literature
is radically different. For the beginnings, the sources of man's being are
clear and solid (the heavens become strong, congealed, come to be) only
until the point where he begins to be conscious, to name the world,
himself and God.64 From this point, it is a matter of hours till he has
named his reality65 in such a way that what remains is a world that is not
really there, in which the whole creation story is subdy undermined.66

The Pivoting Point
27
Tie world decomposed and recomposed
In such a situation, no return to the firm splendors of origins is possible.
Another, more difficult act of regeneration is required. Here, again, is
Rashi's comment on God's final assessment of the already disintegrated
world:
"The sixth day": the definite article [beb] is added here to teach that
God had made a condition with all the works of the beginning,  
depending on Israel's acceptance of the Five [the numerical value of beb] Books
of the Torah. Another reading: All the works of the beginning are
suspended (lit., hanging and standing) until the sixth day of Sivan,
which is destined for the Giving of the Torah. (1:31)67
Rashi's source68 reads like this: "The definite article is not necessary.
Resh Lakish taught: God made a condition with the works of the  
Beginning—If Israel accepts the Torah, you will continue to exist; if not, I will
bring you back to chaos."
The radical effect of this talmudic passage is to undermine all the
clarities, the achieved articulations, the crystalline firmness of Creation.
For the question of meaning remains unresolved: "to be or not to be" is a
question that is "suspended and standing" till Mount Sinai, There is a
provisional quality to the reality of the world, a rofef ambivalence about
meaning, which no fearful utterance of God can shock man into  
crystallizing. The world, till Sinai, awaits its true creation; man feels the
question hanging over him, nothing is solid in his consciousness until
some essential point of equilibrium is discovered.
This is not simply a matter of a shotgun commitment being demanded
of the people at Mount Sinai. Their standing at the mountain is an
experience in extremis of the instability, the terror, and madness of the
world. Here is the version of the narrative found in Pesikta Rabbati:
"Earth and all its inhabitants dissolve: it is I who keeps its pillars
[amudeha, standing supports] firm" (Psalms 75:4). The world was in
the process of dissolving. Had Israel not stood before Mount Sinai and
said, "All that God has spoken, we will faithfully do [lit., we will do and
we will listen (Exodus 20:7)] the world would already have returned to
chaos. And who made a foundation for the world? "It is I—anokbi—
who keeps its pillars firm" —in the merit of "I—anokbi— am the Lord
your God who brought you out of the Land of Egypt."69

28
BERESHIT
On a first reading, it seems that what saves the world from  
decomposing is God and His Law, which the people obediendy accept. ("It is I who
gives solidity to the world, through My commandments, encoded in the
opening word of the Ten Commandments, anokhi—I. . . .") But there is
another possible —and compelling—reading. Here, the anokhi, which
gives substance and coherence to reality, is the "I" of human beings.
Rashi reads the prooftext, the verse from Psalms (75:4), in just this
unexpected way: " 'It is I who keeps its pillars firm'—when I said, 'We
shall do and we shall listen.'" The people are responsible for the "I" that
"fixes," that congeals a dissolving reality. The world is saved by a human
affirmation, a human "standing at Sinai," which halts the process of
disintegration.
In an even more paradoxical version of this idea, the midrash quotes
provocatively: "'But now thus said the Lord—Who created you, O
Jacob, Who formed you, O Israel': (Isaiah 43:1) God said to His world,
'My world, My world, I shall tell you who created you, who formed you.
Jacob created you, Jacob formed you —as it is said, "Who created you:
Jacob. Who formed you: Israel.'""70
God speaks lovingly to His world — and assigns it another creator. It is
apparently human consciousness, in all its contingency, that "creates the
world." In this sense, God "becomes" the Creator of the world, only
when the question of meaning has been decided by man.
The notion of "world making," which, according to Rashi, is the chief
enticement of the serpent in the Garden ('"You shall be like God' —
Creators of worlds" [3:5]) is one that has become very familiar since the
advent of cognitive psychology. Nelson Goodman's central thesis, for
example, is that "what we call the world is a product of some mind whose
symbolic procedures construct the world."71
Jerome Bruner offers a succinct account of Goodman's notion of the
creation of realities, and the complex—and changing—symbol systems
that allow for constant "transformation of worlds":
These constructions have in common that they take certain premises
for granted, as stipulations. What is "given" or assumed at the outset of
our construction is neither bedrock reality out there, nor an a priori: it
is always another constructed version of a world that we have taken as
given for certain purposes. . . . So, in effect, world making involves the
transformation of worlds and world versions already made.72

The Pivoting Point
29
This transformation is achieved when we
compose and decompose worlds, impelled by different aims in doing
so. . . . We weight and emphasize features of previous worlds in  
creating new ones. . . . We impose order, and since all is in motion, the
order or reordering we impose is a way too of imposing alternate
stabilities. . . . We deform the given that we took and create  
caricature, the caricature itself being principled rather than entirely fanci-
fill. . . . 73
Transformation as distortion of the given, as principled caricature: this
is the core of Goodman's concept of world making. We recall the famous
midrash that describes God Himself as "creating worlds and destroying
them,,, before He achieved an opus that gave Him satisfaction.74 The
model for creativity sketched here is not remote from Goodman's model;
constructions follow each other, each a "world," with its own givens, its
"stipulations," decomposing world versions already made.
If we try to make use of this model, we can ask: what, in all seriousness,
is the transformative moment of Sinai? In what sense is it true to say that
Jacob creates the world, as he stands before the mountain, as he says, "We
shall do and we shall listen" ? Clearly, in making this resonant declaration
(which is rather tidied away in the JPS translation: "We will faithfully
do"), they are distorting the normal processes of cognition and action. It
is common sense that first one hears, understands, and then one acts.
The Talmud, continuing from the passage we read previously about
the conditional nature of God's creation, has a heavenly voice cry out,
"Who has revealed to My children this secret the angels make use of, for
it is written (Psalms 103:20): 'Bless the Lord, O His angels, mighty
creatures who do His bidding, hearkening to the sound of His word' —
They do before hearing."75
To distort the order of doing and hearing is a secret of the angels. As
Emmanuel Levinas points out, we are not dealing with "the  
consciousness of children," with an infantile concept of blind faith.76 A rational
world is decomposed here; what is composed, set in its place, is a possible
world that only angels (who "stand upright") have represented until now.
Levinas calls this the world of "any inspired act, even artistic, for the act
only brings out the form in which it only now recognizes its model, never
glimpsed before. ... [It indicates] a going beyond knowledge . . . [that]

30
BERESHIT
could not be the deed of an underdeveloped human nature. It is a
perfectly adult effort."77
We might, in fact, call the mode of action before knowledge a kind of
spiritual virtuosity. Angels do what is complex and difficult with organic
ease. In order to achieve the same effect of simultaneity, in which  
commands are transmitted from the brain to the nervous system to the
muscles so fluidly that performance seems to precede input, human
beings normally have to work very hard. But there is a triumphant
moment when the normal laborious procedures of will and execution are
short-circuited. In that virtuoso moment, a new world is created.
This is the experience of Jacob-Israel, as he discovers in himself the
anokhi, the "I" of the world maker. He meets the anokhi of the World
Maker and responds with the spontaneous energy of the unitary self. In
that moment, a new map of reality is drawn—strange, imposing new
stabilities. The "deep structure of subjectivity,,, as Levinas calls it, is
acknowledged by human beings, when they encounter that same  
subjectivity expressed by God.
It is the anokhi, the "I," that creates a foundation for the world. In the
original Creation, there is no anokhi: there is Necessity, there is the fiat
that freezes the world into its forms. When God says anokhi at Sinai,
however, something very different happens; a process that had begun in
the enigmatic "very good," of failure, exile, and death, reaches its
culmination.
This culmination is described in Shemot Rabbah, 29:9:
When God gave the Torah, no bird sang, no fowl flew, no ox bellowed,
the Ophanim spread no wings, the Seraphim did not declare, "Holy,
Holy, Holy. . . ." The sea did not rage, people did not speak, but the
world was in utter silence. And there came forth the Voice, "I am the
Lord your God. . . ." It is written, "The Lord spoke these words—
these and no more —to your whole congregation with a mighty
voice. . . ." What is the meaning of "these and no more"? When one
calls out to one's friend, one's voice echoes; but the Voice that came out
of the mouth of God had no echo. And if this surprises you, think of
Elijah, who came to Mount Carmel, gathered all the priests of Baal,
and told them, "Shout louder! After all, he is a god!" [1 Kings 18:27].
What did God do? He silenced the whole world, muted upper and
lower worlds, till the world was again unformed and void, as though
there were no created being in the world, as it is said, "There was no
sound, and none who responded or listened" [18:26]. For if anyone had

The Pivoting Point
31
spoken, they would have said, "Baal answered us." How much greater
was the silence of the world when God spoke at Sinai! Only so could
God's creatures know that there is nothing aside from Him. And then
He said, uanokhi—\ am the Lord your God,"
The extraordinary claim of this midrash is that the Torah is given
when the process of decreation, the decomposition of the world, has
reached its completion. In the silence of a time before Creation, before
individuation and separation, none of the "stipulations," the found  
constructions of previous worlds exists. The question of meaning erodes all
the facades of reality.
Mircea Eliade writes of an "archaic ontology," a "belief in an absolute
reality opposed to the profane world of 'unrealities,; in the last analysis,
the latter does not constitute a 'world/ properly speaking; it is the
'unreal' par excellence, the uncreated, the nonexistent: the void."78 In
"primitive societies," there is a profound sense that "everything that
lacks an exemplary model is'meaningless,' i.e., it lacks reality. . . . [Man]
sees himself as real, i.e., as 'truly himself,' only, and precisely, insofar as he
ceases to be so."79
"In the last analysis, [the world] does not constitute a 'world'": the
midrash, too, is concerned with "the last analysis"; but it offers a different
response to the despair of a world returned to ultimate unreality. The
question inherent in Creation emerges with full force. This is the  
question that the angels are recorded as asking in so many midrashic  
narratives: "Why? . . . Why create man? And with him, for him, the whole
complex environment that is the universe?" What the Israelites  
experience at Sinai is the devastation, the return to "unreality," of the world.
Out of this emerges, not the primal Yehi, the first fiat, "Let there be," but
instead, this time, simply the voice of God saying, "Anokhi—I am."
The terror of such an experience is palpable. "It has been clearly
demonstrated to you that the Lord alone is God; there is none beside
Him" (Deuteronomy 4:35). Rashi's comment emphasizes the visual-
mystical experience of de-realization: "When God gave the Torah, he
opened the seven firmaments, upper and lower worlds were torn apart,
and they saw that He is alone; that is why it says, '[lit.] you were shown'"
In other words, what the people overwhelmingly see is that there is
nothing, nothing to stand on. "If you do not accept the Torah, I shall
return the world to chaos and emptiness."

32
BERESHIT
What saves the world, indeed what in a real sense creates the world, is
the capacity of the people to encounter the terror of the anokhi. "It is
anokhi, it is I who keeps the pillars—amudeha [lit., standing supports] —
firm" (Psalms 75:4). What is the infrastructure that gives substance to
reality? One perspective emphasizes the anokhi of God —the  
transcendent and only reality. But another—audacious and difficult—emphasizes
the anokhi of human beings. It is man's ability to meet the voice of God
out of the void, and to respond with his own anokhi: "We will do, we will
make the world/'
In this perspective, Israel creates the world, simply by finding a place
to stand at Sinai. The giving of the Torah is, of course, idiomatically and
commonly referred to as ma^amadharsinai—xht standing at Sinai. To be
able to stand "face to face" (Deuteronomy 5:4) with the God who alone
exists and whose anokhi emerges from a vast silence is to take that
immensity of the anokhi immediately within oneself. Analogously,  
perhaps, with the effect of great poetry, "an intimate call of immensity may
be heard, even more than the echo of the outside world."80
To "make" the world is the charge that God left man with at the end of
the original creation process, when "God ceased from all the work of
Creation that He had done." La'asot, translated here as "that He had
done," is actually the infinitive form, "to do"; the world is created open-
ended, open to the doing, the making of man. And the word that recurs in
God's reproaches to Eve and the Serpent is precisely this verb, la'asot:
"What is this you have done?. . . . Because you have done this . . ."
(3:13, 14). What a disappointing act this is! Immediately, the possibility
of standing in the world is reduced.
At Sinai, a covenant is made both with a people "who are standing here
with us this day before the Lord our God and with those who are not with
us here this day" (Deuteronomy 29:19). This last group, says the mid-
rash,81 refers to future prophets, yet unborn. Of them, the word omed,
"standing," cannot be used, as it is used to describe those physically
present at Sinai. For ein ba-hem mamash — xht unborn "have no reality."
Only those who are substantial, live within time and space and the
contingencies of the earth, can be depicted as omed, as standing.82
The people of Sinai affirm their ability to stand face to face with God.
But what seems a static position is exposed, in a midrash quoted by Rashi,
as a fulcrum of desire and fear, a point of equilibrium in the eye of the
storm: "'And all the people saw the voices . . . and they moved back-

The Pivoting Point
33
wards and they stood at a distance' (Exodus 20:15): they were repelled to
the rear a distance of twelve miles — that is, the whole length of the camp.
Then the angels came and helped them forward again." If this happened
at each of the Ten Commandments, the people are imagined as travelling
240 miles in order to stand in place! The ebb and flow, the awe and the
passion, are contained within a human "stance," that allows them to hold
ground as anokhi encountering anokhi.
There may be something angelic about the capacity to say, "We shall
do and then hear." But the people stand as human beings do, aware of
tensions and countertensions. And, of course, they "fall" very soon after;
"like princes you fall" (Psalms 82:6-7).
The Talmud makes an extraordinary observation about the paradoxes
of "standing": "No man stands on [i.e., can rightly under-stand] the
words of Torah, unless he has stumbled over them."83 To discover firm
standing ground, it is necessary to explore, to stumble, even to fall,
certainly to survive the chaotic vibrations of a world that refuses to be.
The gelid certainties of the fully created world are immediately  
undermined; only because of death and failure is man impelled to create the
world anew. "Tremble in His presence, all the earth! The world stands
firm; it cannot be shaken" (1 Chronicles 16:30). One might read this by
tuning the strings of paradox tighter: "Tremble in His presence—so that
the world may stand firm and not collapse." For how can one stand at all,
if one does not know the tremor?84
The experiment in form
To stand in the presence of God is not, then, to be static: it is a kind of
dance, invisible to the naked eye. Neither rigidity nor chaos is God's
desire of man. What He desires is the human response of transformation.
Erich Neumann writes: "For Satan as antithesis to the primordial living
world of transformation is rigidity . . . but at the same time he appears as
its opposite, as chaos. . . . The smooth, undifferentiated fixity of the one
is inseparable from the molluscous, undifferentiated chaos of the other. . . .
In the creative sphere, they give rise to a third term, which embraces and
transcends them both, and this is form. . . . [that] is menaced from both
sides, by sclerosis and by chaotic disintegration."85
When the first experiment in human form seems to have failed, and
God contemplates the "loss of the work of His hands," He mourns as a

34
BERESHIT
human artist or father would mourn. "And His heart was saddened"
(Genesis 6:6). Rashi here quotes a provocative midrash, which purports
to deal with the theological absurdity of the anthropomorphism:
A certain skeptic asked R. Yehoshua ben Korha, "Do you not believe
that God foresees the future?" He answered, "Yes." "But it says, 'His
heart was saddened'?" "Did you ever have a son born to you?" "Yes."
"And what did you do?" "I rejoiced and made everyone else happy."
"But didn't you know that your son would eventually die?" "In time
of joy, there is joy; and in time of mourning, there is mourning."
R. Yehoshua said, "That is the way of God. Even though it was revealed
to Him that His children would eventually sin and be destroyed, He
was not prevented from creating them — for the sake of the righteous who
were destined to descend [lit., to stand up] from them."
The skeptic asks about God's "disappointment," in view of the  
doctrine of God's omniscience. He uses the idiomatic expression for  
"foreknowledge": "Does God see the nolad, that which is already, barely
born?" Within the frame of God overseeing the vistas of space and
time—a transcendent God, who, in His "high solitude," knows what
must be, as though it already were—within the frame of Necessity, what
room is there for tears or for laughter, for hope or disappointment?86
"Yes, of course," answers R. Yehoshua: that is an obvious frame within
which to view God. But the question R. Yehoshua asks, instead of
answering explicitly, has to do with human experience, with the irrational
freedom to rejoice, to mourn, not as one at the top of a belfry, not
metaphysically, or theoretically. Theoria, in Greek, suggests taking a view
of a large stretch of territory from a great distance, and favors the idea of a
vertical view downward. It rises above "the plurality of appearances in the
hope that, seen from the heights, an unexpected unity will become
evident— a unity which is a sign that something real has been glimpsed."87
In place of the nolad metaphor, the foreknowledge of a necessary future,
that is not yet, but that can be seen from the top of the belfry as "already
born," there is the contingency of the live child, who will die.88 It is this
frame, of contingency and passion, that God chooses to inhabit. Just as a
human father does, God assumes the risks of the live process of creation.
However, the analogy with human fatherhood breaks down on one
essential point. Unlike the father, God did not have to create the  
problematic, volatile being who will sadden Him. It is not by free choice that

The Pivoting Point
35
the father brings his son into the world. Why does God, in His freedom
and power, choose to create this admittedly doomed creature? To  
respond to this implicit question, Rashi adds his last sentence, which does
not occur in his source midrash:89 "He was not prevented from creating
them — for the sake of the righteous who were destined to 'stand up' from
them."
Here, Rashi answers the question implicit in the father-son analogy.
The question, again, is "Why?. . . . Why create man at all, why create a
problem?" He was not prevented by His foreknowledge from engaging
in the whole frustrating project—"because of the righteous"—bishvil ha-
tzaddikim. The price to be paid for a tzaddik — a righteous man—is
creation. The hazards and contingencies of the creative act are the loam
out of which true form emerges. There is no way of achieving true form
without opening possibilities of all manner of travesties. For to create is
precisely not entirely to control. "If I create man," says God, in Rashi's
second source midrash,90 "wicked people will emerge from him. But if I
don't create him, how will righteous people 'stand up' from him?"
To consummate creation with a free-standing tzaddik—that always
was the point of the enterprise. We return here to the beginning, to that
so-clear and structured and "real" description of unities breaking down
into smaller and increasingly specific parts. "In the beginning, God
created heaven and earth." Rashi says: "This verse is nothing if not
mysterious [lit., This verse says nothing but "Explain me!"] —as the
Sages said, 'God created the world for the sake of the Torah, which is
called "reshit—the beginning of His way" (Proverbs 8:22) and for the sake
of the righteous, who are called "reshit—'Ait beginning of His produce"'"
(Jeremiah 2:3).
On no account, Rashi declares, can the opening verse be a description
of the origins of the universe.
The text does not intend to teach the order of creation. . . . And if
you say that this verse teaches that heaven and earth were created
first... be ashamed of yourself! [lit., be surprised at yourself]. For the
waters were already in existence, as it is written, "And the spirit of God
hovered over the face of the waters." Since there has not yet been any
reference to the creation of the waters, they must already have been in
existence before the earth and heaven were created. Clearly, then, the
text does not propose to give a chronological account of creation.

36 BERESHIT
Significantly, Rashi opens his great commentary on the Torah with a
response to the mystery of the words. He does offer apeshat reading—a
straightforward contextual reading91 —but only in second place. He
draws his primary energy from the enigmatic midrashic decoding of the
mystery. Bereshit, "In the beginning," describes not the clarities of origin
and cause, but the potentialities of purpose. "For the sake of the  
righteous" means that all is open. There is no foundation; the beginning of a
pathway glimmers. (Bishvil— "for the sake of" —but lit., on the path
towards). In the future, at some time, in some place, a human being may
create the world. God now authors the work that will go in search of
authors. What is given at the beginning challenges man to the self-
transformations that will allow him, in spite of everything, to stand in the
presence of God.
Will transformation. Oh be inspired for the flame
in which a Thing disappears and bursts into something else;
the spirit of re-creation which masters this earthly form
loves most the pivoting point where you are no longer
yourself.
He who pours himself out like a stream is acknowledged at
last by Knowledge;
and she leads him enchanted through the harmonious country
that finishes often with starting, and with ending begins.92

NOAH W
Kindness and Ecstasy
The collapse of God's project
When men began to increase on earth and daughters were born to
them, the divine beings saw how beautiful the daughters of men were
and took wives from among those that pleased them. The Lord said,
"My breath shall not abide in man forever, since he too is flesh; let the
days allowed him be one hundred and twenty years."—It was then, and
later too, that the Nephilim appeared on earth —when the divine
beings cohabited with the daughters of men, who bore them offspring.
They were the heroes of old, the men of renown. The Lord saw how
great was man's wickedness on earth, and how every plan devised by his
mind was nothing but evil all the time. And the Lord regretted that He
had made man on earth, and His heart was saddened. The Lord said, "I
will blot out from the earth the men whom I created —men together
with beasts, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I regret that I
made them." But Noah found favor with the Lord. (6:1-8)
God's decision to "blot out" the whole of creation follows on an
account of births and deaths over ten generations, culminating in the
birth and naming of Noah. The central event of each generation is the
birth of the significant heir; the father's years are numbered before and
after this pivotal act of propagation. Intense expectation builds up,  
therefore, in this objective account of numbers and names, an expectation that
becomes explicit when the reason for Noah's name is given by Lamekh,
his father: "This one will provide us relief [y'nahamenu] from our work
and from the toil of our hands, out of the very soil which the Lord placed
under a curse" (5:29). That Noah's name is derived from the word neh-
ama, "comfort," is in itself strange: etymologically, the word noah,
meaning "rest," would seem more appropriate; and, in fact, Rashi insists
on treating y'nahamenu as a pun on yaniah mimenu—"God will give us
37

38
NOAH
relief— from the labor of our hands." (Otherwise, as he points out, Noah
should have been named Menahem!)
There begins to be woven, therefore, a tissue of verbal plays on the
words noah, nabem: the comfort Noah will bring to mankind is the relief
from a relation with nature that is misarticulated and, in some real sense,
perverse. (Rashi: "Noah invented the plough—before his time, people
would plant wheat and the earth would produce thorns and thistles.")
Noah is therefore seen, at least by his father, as representing a  
readjustment of man's relation with the world; in effect, he will neutralize the
primal curse on Adam.1 This is the human expectation; it is followed by
Lamekh's and Noah's significant age-data, until the birth of Noah's
three sons.
Chapter 6 begins with the cryptic description of the sexual relations of
the "divine beings" with the "daughters of men" — including reference
to the Nephilim, giants, heroes, men of renown. Only at this point does
God, it seems, reenter a drama of sexuality, procreation, and death in
which human beings have been evolving their own destiny without
comment from or dialogue with their creator. Even the function of
creating man in His image has been taken over, apparently, by man
himself: "When God created man, He made him in the likeness of
God. . . . When Adam had lived 130 years, he begot a son in his likeness
after his image." (5: 1, 3)
Man replicates himself; in so doing, indirectly, he will replicate the
divine image. That is the model suggested by Adam's first act of  
procreation after the sin. But the image of man is distorted. God "sees" that evil
has swollen to enormous proportions (6: 5, 12). An act of divine  
perception occurs: no human being is capable of such an act, it seems. Man had
desired the "knowledge of good and evil"; by now, he seems unaware of
the evil that, ambiguously, he has both generated and suffers. Evil
overshadows his life; he no longer knows, or can discriminate between,
those radical opposites that Buber describes: "the fortune and the  
misfortune or the order and the disorder that are experienced by a person, as
well as that which he causes."2
A kind of sensitivity is lost to man. At this point, God, with a terrible
humor, quotes the word-play on Noah's name, subtly transforming the
meanings and indulging in a positive flurry of puns. The root nahem,
"comfort," which held out hope of comfort or relief, now denotes
"regret," a radical revision of the entire Adam project (6:6). The curse, in

Kindness and Ecstasy
39
which the relation of Adam to adama, "ground," had been skewed ten
generations previously, was, in the human perspective, to have been lifted
by Noah. When God acts on His vision of things, however, it seems that
the curse is, instead, to be intensified to the point of utter destruction.
There is a clear sense that something problematic, even bizarre, is at
work in the very use of language itself: the explosion of puns raises
questions about limits and liberties, about structure and play. As we shall
eventually see, this is a powerful issue: what does it mean to use language
truly or wrongly? The shadow of catastrophe looms, even as language
begins to display its resources.
The word God uses for destruction is emheb — "! will blot out" (6:7).
Rashi translates to different effect: "He is dust, so I shall bring water
upon him and dissolve him." This is to be a watery destruction, not a dry
one. The original dust-earth of man—his relation to the adama—\s to be
radically annulled by an overapplication, as it were, of water. It then
transpires that man's destruction is also to be the destruction of all life —
animal, reptile, and bird — again under the rubric oinehama — the cosmic
"regret" of the creative God. The root words, nahem, noah, are joined in
an associative cluster with the root mahah, "dissolution."
The last verse of Parshat Bereshit returns explicitly to Noah and
evokes a fundamental unease about the relation of this one individual,
who was to have given relief to a strained world, and the total destruction
that God has just declared, in His own voice. The narrative voice takes
over for a short, final half-verse: "And Noah found favor with the Lord"
(6:8). Noah matza hen — the words noah and hen form a palindrome,
suggesting a subversive relation between the man and the "favor" he
finds, the grace with which God sees him. So many expectations are
being undermined; there is a kind of mirror-reflection of Noah that God
sees and saves from the debacle. It is as though only by an imaginative act
of vision can God decide to exempt Noah from the clearly stated general
fate of the whole Adam project.
'The choice of Noah
There is a profound tension in this passage: in a sense, God declares an
intention, based on a vision, and immediately revokes it, because of
another vision of things. The tension is subtly reinforced by the fact that

40
NOAH
it is the narrative voice that seemingly undercuts the decisiveness of
God's declaration —as though shrewdly making a comment on the  
emotional reservation of which God Himself is, as yet, unaware. A few verses
later, this tension has surfaced in God's speech. He communicates it to
Noah, in His first words to him: "I have decided to put an end to all
flesh. . . . Make yourself an ark of gopher wood" (6:13-14).
"An end to all flesh" could not be more unequivocal: it is qualified
only by an augmentation— "I am about to destroy them with the earth."
And yet there is the exception. Noah is at first not told the reason for his
survival. Rather, God speaks of the technical details of the Ark, of a
covenant that will cover his family and two of every living species, of food
arrangements. It is only when God again speaks to Noah, telling him to
board the ark he has already constructed, that an explanatory clause is
added: "for you alone have I found [lit., seen] righteous before Me in this
generation" (7:1).
The rationale is apparently simple and ethically reassuring. Noah is
different from his generation. They are full of evil, of violence; he is
righteous. Buber, indeed, comments that he is the first human being to be
described by any epithet. He is certainly the only human being in the
entire biblical narrative to be described as "righteous"3 both in direct
encounter with God and in the authoritative narrative voice that begins
the Parsha: "Noah was a righteous man; he was blameless in his age"
(6:9). The great emphasis on Noah's difference from his contemporaries
serves an obvious moral purpose. It justifies his exemption from the
universal disaster, and the choice of him to found a new race of Adam.4 In
a creative project that has proved a total failure (the text harps constantly
on totality, through the repetition of the word koly "all"5), there is yet one
detail that can be salvaged and can provide a basis for a reworking of the
idea. God's act in destroying and saving is seen to be ethically coherent:
there is an unarguable logic to the ruthlessness of the artist who shreds
all unsuccessful drafts and retains only the one that approximates his
original intent.
But, close beneath the surface of the text, and glaringly exposed in
many midrashic versions of the narrative, there is another reading. On
this reading, Noah is chosen not because he is absolutely different, but
because he "finds favor in the eyes of God." In what merit, asks the
midrash, was he saved? The very question, with its multiple answers, is
damning. In a famous comment, Rashi questions the qualifying phrase,

Kindness and Ecstasy
41
"righteous in his generations" Does this damn him with faint praise (only
in his corrupt time did he look like a hero)? Or does it praise him for
transcending the sociomoral pressures of his period? In either case, the
full-blown epithet, "perfectly righteous," is subjected to a refracting
process that troubles its immaculate surface.
Ultimately, the suggestion that Noah is saved more because of the
grace of God than because of any intrinsic grace of his own being is
unavoidable. Midrash Tanhuma elaborates on this possibility:
This is like one [ehad\ who was traveling along and saw another traveler
[ebad] and sought his company. To what extent? Till he formed bonds
of love with him. That is why it says here, "Noah found favor.\*'
Compare this with "Joseph found favor in [Potiphar's] eyes" [39:4]. It
is like one who was traveling along and saw another traveler and sought
his company. To what extent? Till he gave him power. ... To what
extent? Till he gave him his daughter. . . . To what extent? Till he
could tell which animal is to be fed at the second hour of the day, and
which at the third hour of the night.6
The traveler's choice of companion as narrated here is almost  
arbitrary. It is because He is One-alone-matchless that He seeks another
one —any one —so that He may love, empower, and educate him. The
anonymous hero, undeserving, finds himself married to the King's
daughter. In many midrashic parables, the King's daughter is identified as
wisdom. So, here, God chooses Noah, not because he has achieved
significant wisdom or virtue, but because He seeks to convey to some one
the knowledge of Himself. The commoner marries the King's daughter.
But what is the intention of the end of the midrash? The acme of wisdom
that Noah attains is a knowledge of the feeding schedules of the animals
in the ark! Is this bathos, a satiric comment on Noah's limitations, or a
serious insight into the nature of the wisdom that God has to teach Noah?
At any rate, Noah's heroic status, his difference from his generation, is
undermined. The ethical underpinning to God's choice becomes less
clear. The most explicit shattering of ethical clarities, however, is to be
found in Sanhedrin 108a: "Noah had a death sentence sealed against
him. But he found favor in the eyes of God."7 In this reading, Noah is of a
piece with his generation. He is essentially included in God's "regret,"
nehama. Only love can invert Noah into few — an object of beauty: "you I
have seen as righteous before Me" (7:1).

42
NOAH
Disturbing questions about God's dealings with human beings arise
inevitably from such a reading. If Noah is not such an unequivocal
tzaddik, if his election is not entirely on merit, then what is the ethical
statement of the Flood narrative? Perhaps there were others like Noah
who were destroyed in the cataclysm? The midrash does not evade such a
possibility. Indeed, Midrash Tanhuma goes so far as to construct an
evolving model of individual justice; the rules of the game change when
the Torah is given: "From the time that Israel stood before Mount Sinai
and God gave them the Torah, any individual who sinned would be
punished by God. Previously, one man might sin and the whole  
generation be punished. Of the generation of the Flood, our sages said that there
were many decent people like Noah who were obliterated with the
generation."8
On this view, the giving of the Torah marks a turning point in God's
relation with human beings. Now, every man is treated after his deserts;
previously, God's dealings with mankind were summary and rough-
hewn. On such a view, however, there would be no motivation for a post-
Sinai generation to read the Flood narrative at all. Beyond the purely
historical interest, what is to be gained from such a reading? We read,
says Paul Valery, to "acquire some power." If radical questions of evil and
punishment are confronted in the narrative in ways that are no longer
relevant, then our knowledge and power as readers are not significantly
increased.
The theological question
Moreover, in Rashi's reading, based on a plethora of midrashic sources,
the Torah itself instructs the reader to read with a different assumption.
In several passages, the Flood narrative becomes the epicenter of  
questioning about God's ways with mankind. The Flood remains a live issue;
no statute of limitations has withered its relevance. Moses tells the people
at the end of his life, in his final song: "Remember the days of old,
consider the years of generations past" (Deuteronomy 32:7). Rashi  
comments: " 'Remember': What He did to those first people who angered
Him. 'Consider': This refers to the generation of Enosh, when the ocean
flooded them, and to the generation of the Flood, which washed them
away [sbotfam]"

Kindness and Ecstasy
43
A people that does not read history and that therefore has no sense of
the vast spectrum of possibilities within God's range is called a "dull and
witless people" (Deuteronomy 32:6). Rashi unpacks the description:
"They have forgotten what happened in the past, and therefore cannot
understand the future: that He has the power to do good and to do evil."
The idea that history is to be read for the sake of the present and the
future focuses on the Flood and its earlier warning version in the time of
Enosh.9 And the main affirmation Rashi has to make about the Flood
relates precisely to our question of individual justice (Deuteronomy
32:4):
"The Rock! His deeds are perfect": Even though He is strong, when He
brings retribution on those who transgress His will, He brings it, not in
a flood [sbetef\y but with justice, for "His deeds are perfect."
"A faithful God": to recompense the righteous for their righteousness
in the world to come. And although He may delay their reward, in the
end
He will fulfill His words.
"And without iniquity": Even to the wicked, He pays the reward of their
righteousness in this world.
One of the basic theological questions is addressed here, the enigma of
God's relations with mankind. Essentially, Rashi reads the verse as saying
that despite appearances, ultimately (that is, from the perspective of the
world to come), God is just to each individual. What may look like the
neglect of the righteous, or the pampering of the wicked in this world, is
"in the end" deciphered as coherent and morally just.
For our purposes, however, what is interesting here is the imagery
implicit in the word sheteff "flood." God brings retribution not in one
indiscriminate cataclysm, but with justice —that is, commensurate with
the individual and his merits. The word shetif implicitly evokes the Flood.
It is the word that Rashi himself uses a few verses later, as we have seen, to
describe the fate of the Flood generation: "He washed them away." On
one occasion, at least, God did, quite literally, "wash away" an entire
generation, a mass of people and animals and insects, and the very earth
itself, to a depth of three handbreadths below the surface —as far as the
plough of human (agri)culture could fathom.10 And Rashi, it seems, is
inviting us to consider the questions raised by the apparently undis-
criminating destruction exemplified by the Flood. Indeed, he insists that

44
NOAH
without such a searching reading, there is no way for the people to face
essential problems of the present and future.
Rashi essentially affirms his faith in an ultimate justice, in spite of a
world where His power is more apparent than His discrimination. What
may look like shetef—xhe overpowering surge of mighty waters11 that
washes away guilty and innocent alike — is to be seen in the total context
of the world-to-come. But the problem of sbetef is not so easily dismissed
by Rashi himself, nor indeed by his sources in the midrash. When God
consigns the whole world to destruction, with the words "I have decided
to put an end to all flesh" (6:13), Rashi comments: "Wherever you find
sexual sin and idolatry, andralamousia comes to the world and kills good
and bad (indiscriminately)."
Andralamousia is the term, borrowed from the Greek, for summary
mass execution, the same notion as was indicated by the word shetef,
"flood." Rashi here draws on the acknowledgment in many sources12 that
there may indeed be a disaster in which individual merits are entirely
ignored. In one midrash, Noah is the king's friend and therefore is sealed
away in a prison, to exempt him from the general fate (andralamousia).1\*
On the other hand, there are many midrashic sources that stoutly deny
any such possibility. Their message is clear: unlike a human king, who
cannot discriminate between friend and foe, God saves the sterling
individual, even as He punishes the corrupt masses. And the case of Noah
is brought in evidence for this affirmation.14
The anxiety generated by the question of God's discrimination and
providence is expressed in Rashi's reading of the two most poignant
complaints on this subject in the Torah. First, there is Abraham's
passionate defence of Sodom: "Far be it from You, to do such a thing, to
bring death upon the innocent as well as the guilty, so that innocent and
guilty fare alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth
deal justly?" (18:25). Rashi comments: "Tar be it from You!' It is a
travesty of You! People will say, That is His usual work—He washes away
everyone, righteous and wicked alike! That is what You did to the
generation of the Flood and to the generation of the Tower of Babel."15
Abraham here imagines what people will say. He projects a possible
reading of the Flood narrative, in which God's character, what He
habitually does, His "speciality" (lit., craftsmanship) is subject to fits of
irrational and petulant anger. "Far be it from You!" Clearly, Abraham
is as concerned for God's reputation as he is for the threatened city of

Kindness and Ecstasy
45
Sodom. In one of Rashes sources, Abraham says: "This is a profanation of
God —people will be held back by this from returning to You."16
The interesting assumption here is that the Flood narrative has  
become a paradigm of interpretation in Abraham's time. People obviously
are saying the kinds of things that Abraham projects here. In another
midrashic version, Abraham does not, in fact, project the nihilistic view
onto "people," but simply—though rhetorically—asks, "Is this not a
travesty of You? Is this what You did to the generation of the Flood and to
the generation of the Tower of Babel? This is not Your way."17 Here,
Abraham is confronting an obvious reading of the Flood paradigm. On
this reading, there is a grotesque consistency to God's arbitrariness: He
acts true to character. "Master of the universe, far be it from You! . . . Let
people not say, 'That is his usual work: He destroys the generations in the
mode of cruelty. He destroyed the generation of Enosh and the generation
of the Flood and of the Tower of Babel. He does not change from His
usual work!' "18
Twice, Abraham protests, "Far be it from You!" The second time,
Rashi comments, "in the world to come." Such a view of God's  
relationship with human beings cries to high heaven: it affects not only what his
contemporaries may say in their particular historical situation, but all
future generations. Gur Arye translates "the world to come" here, as "in
future generations." The Flood will never lose its potency to generate
questions about shetef— about mass destruction and the relation of God
to the individual. Wherever a similar situation recurs, the Flood  
paradigm will be cited, and people's darkest fears about their existential
situation will be confirmed.
For the shetef model, with its image of a cruel, undiscriminating God,
will always have enough apparent evidence to support it. Gur Arye
emphasizes that no proof of God's response to the individual can ever be
convincing. Noah's survival, for instance, will be attributed to the need
for the species to survive, and not to his personal affirmation of values
different from those of his time. The Flood model of shetef will be
confirmed particularly by its triple occurrence as the basic mechanism of
God's dealings with mankind. But perhaps, Gur Arye suggests, there are
specific reasons, in each of these generations, for the general destruction
that is called shetef? In the case of the Flood, he refers to Rashi's cryptic
assertion, quoted previously, that sexual sin results in indiscriminate
disaster. We shall return to this notion later.

46
NOAH
The second example of the Flood as a paradigm for mass, irrational
destruction in the thinking of later generations is the midrashic reading
of the episode involving Avimelekh and Sarah. Avimelekh has kidnapped
Sarah, and God has spoken to him in a dream, threatening death for
adultery. Avimelech pleads ignorance: he was told Sarah is Abraham's
sister, not wife; and, in any case, he has not touched her. According to the
midrash, he cries to God: "Will You kill a righteous nation as well?" The
unexpected word, "nation," in Avimelekh's protest of innocence suggests
that his own case leads him to ask universal philosophical questions:
"Even if he is innocent, will You kill him? Is that Your way—to destroy
nations for no good reason? That is what You did to the generation of the
Flood, and to the generation of the Tower of Babel. / too say that You
killed them for no good reason, as You intend to kill me" (Rashi, 20:4).
Rashi's source19 depicts Avimelekh as motivated by a deep sense of his
own innocence. If he is to be condemned nevertheless, then he is forced
to assume that, in the paradigm Flood situation, the victims must also
have been innocent. He affirms absurdity in God's relations with  
mankind; his speech is a combined text, woven of his personal situation and
his understanding of large historical and philosophical questions. In his
thinking, there is little dialectical tension: "I too say" commits him
squarely to an imagery of absurdity and cruelty.
The Flood, then, in its most radical imagery, becomes for all time a
paradigm of the problem of God's dealings with man. Before we look
more closely at Rashi's cryptic acknowledgment that where there is
sexual sin or idolatry, mass indiscriminate destruction really does occur, it
will be fruitful to consider again the jtoefimage. Stoef expresses the rash
haste with which tyrants punish their populations. "When a king  
condemns his people, no one praises him, because they know that there is
shetef— an angry surge of passion—in his judgment. But God is not xo."20
Human beings, in a condition of shetef, become blind to individual
differences and circumstances. There is a lack of curiosity about this
condition that is the very definition of cruelty. God is not like this, asserts
the midrash: He can always maintain high moral ground in any  
questioning of His judgments.
It is undeniable, however, that the savage imagery of the shetef is to be
found in descriptions of God's dealings with the world. In Isaiah 28:18,
for instance: "When the sweeping flood passes through, you shall be its

Kindness and Ecstasy
47
victims." And in Nahum 1:8: "With a sweeping flood, He makes an end
of His place." And it is one of the most common ways in which the effects
of the Flood are described in talmudic metaphor: all life is swept away,
washed away (nishtafin). It is the violent surge that uproots trees and
mountains, in Ramban's translation of "The waters swelled" (va-yigberu,
Genesis 7:18).
Shetef denotes a quantity of water—mayim rabbim — zndi a force that
leaves nothing intact. The word used in the Torah narrative to describe
the effect of the waters — mahah, "dissolve" — indicates a return to the
"watery" condition of the universe before Creation. Man, as we noticed
in our previous chapter, was originally formed out of the judicious
mixture of dust and water; he was kneaded like dough, by the divine Baker
(Rashi, 2:6). All that is necessary to ruin the structure of his being is to
infiltrate him with an excess of water: in this destruction, the apparent
solidity of the flesh is melted, thawed, and dissolved. All identities
disintegrate; "they were obliterated from the earth" indicates, according
to Ramban, that there is even no memory of their ever having existed
(7:23).
The drama of language
In a powerful midrash,21 the primordial water acquires a symbolic force
that will inform our understanding of the shetef modality:
"Let the waters be gathered into one area" [1:9] — Let there be a limit (kav)
to the waters, as it is said, "The measuring line is being applied to
Jerusalem" [Zekhariah 1:16]. "Let the waters hope [y'kavvu] for Me,
for what I am about to do with them." This like a king who built a
palace and settled dumb people in it. They would rise up early in the
morning and greet the king in sign language. The king said, "If these
dumb people rise early to greet me in sign language, how much better
it would be if they could speak!" So the king settled speaking people in
his palace. They rose up and took over the palace. They said, "This
palace does not belong to the king, it belongs to us." So the king said,
"Let the palace return to its previous state." So, in the beginning,
God's praise rose up only from the water, as it is written, "From the
voices of many waters." And what did they say? "God is majestic on
high" [Psalms 93:4]. God said, "If these waters, which have no speech,
praise Me, when man is created, how much more will he praise Me!"
The generation of Enosh arose and rebelled against Him; the genera-

48
NOAH
tion of the Flood rebelled; the generation of the Tower of Babel
rebelled. God said, "Let these be removed, and let those who were here
before come in their place."
The return to "wateriness" is a return to speechlessness. The drama of
the generations leading up to the Flood and following it becomes a drama
about language, about the paradoxes inherent in the human capacity to
create symbol-systems; it is a drama about civilization and its discontents.
Apparently, the two modalities described here are those of language and
silence: the waters are the dumb servants, while human beings are the
articulate servants. And yet, a kind of inversion of values happens in the
midrash. "From the voices of many waters" — dumb waters speak  
magnificently, giving ecstatic, unequivocal expression to the glory of God. Their
very bodies speak. And the articulate — called pikhim, the intelligent (lit.,
with open mouths) —so misuse their power of speech that they can be
considered as not having said anything. It is a natural consequence of
what they do with language that the dumb waters replace them.
The paradoxes are acute: the waters express a total oceanic  
acquiescence to God's power, while the poignancy of man's power of language is
that it represents a narrowed, filtered inspiration. (There is a "line"
drawn to limit the power of the waters and to make human speech
possible. But that very limit holds out "hope" to the waters that their
retrenchment is only temporary.) To speak as human beings speak is to
make choices at every level of articulation. Which particular version of
reality is to be created through this selection of words? What is not to be
said? Many things, many more than are to be said. How can any model of
reality, expressed in any form of language, vie with the devastating power
of the "voices of many waters"? And yet, it seems, God has expectations
of human beings, in their verbal expressiveness and their intelligence.
Theirs is the power that He wants, apparently. Their structures, their
freedoms, whatever is separate, distinct, and limited in them, can express
a consciousness of God more valuable to Him than the involuntary
ecstasy of the waters.
The "rebellion" of the generation around the Flood can be  
understood as a failure to speak, to communicate with God —or, indeed, with
each other. There is a pathology in the very "openness" {pikhim) of the
Flood generation, which converts openness to a dumbness, a dumbness
of babble rather than of silence.

Kindness and Ecstasy
49
Tbe exile of speech
One of the central midrashic motifs on the Flood is a quotation from
Psalms 142:8: "Free me from prison [lit., from closedness] that I may
praise Your name." Here is one version:
[God said to Noah:] "Come out of the ark." David said, "Free my soul
from prison." When Noah was in the ark, he prayed constandy, "Free
my soul from prison," as it is said, "Therefore let every faithful man
pray to You, in a time when You may be found, that the rushing mighty
waters [shetefmayim rabbim] not overtake him" [Psalms 32:6]. God said
to Noah, "It is decreed before Me that you shall not leave this prison
[closed condition] till twelve months are up." So we find in Isaiah 49:8,
"In an hour of favor I answer you . . . saying to the prisoners, 'Go
free.," For they [the people in the ark] were forbidden [lit., imprisoned]
to have sexual relations. Why? Because when the world is in trouble
and destruction, human beings are forbidden to procreate; so that
there should not be a situation in which man is building while God is
destroying.22
In this complex and poignant midrash, Noah prays constantly in the
ark. He prays to be saved from the prison of his ark. That, at least, is our
opening understanding of Noah's prayer. But the quotation from Psalms
32:6 forces us to realign our perspective on Noah's dilemma. Noah, like
"every faithful man," prays to be saved from the "rushing mighty  
waters"—the expression combines shetefwixh mayim rabbim to  
communicate the undifferentiated dumb violence of the world just outside the
prison of the ark. The prison is both the closed space of the ark and the
too-great openness of the wild raging silence beyond. In his enclosure
within the ark, he is, of course, saved from the waters, but the midrash
emphasizes that, thus imprisoned, he shares the general "decree" against
mankind. He is not exempted from the general malaise; he too must
endure twelve months, immobilized by fear of both openness and  
closedness. In a final move, the prison is associated with sexual death, which
expresses most intimately the breakdown of speech in the rushing mighty
waters surrounding him.
That is, Noah shares with his generation a pathology that is called in
kabbalistic sources "the exile of speech."23 And since "In every  
generation, there is something of the people of the Flood generation,"24 this
pathology is not unknown in the world since the Flood. A fundamental

50
NOAH
disaster has befallen the language powers of human beings. They have
become so open that they are closed to one another. Communication
between subjects has degenerated into a babble of indiscriminate voices.
The silent compression of the ark (the teiva, meaning both "box" and
"word") is the mirror image, the alter ego of the cacophony outside.
Noah, man of his generation, endures the Flood, the misarticulation of
openness and closedness, in an inversion of a deluge all his own.
For what, after all, according to classic midrashic sources, was the
pathology of the Flood generation? The almost formulaic expression for
their sin is that they were shetufim be-zima—"awash with sexual sin." The
sense of shetef, of undiscriminating passion that sweeps away all  
boundaries, is central to the life of the time. The "corruption of all flesh," of
which God speaks to Noah (6:12), is a profound disintegration of identity
that is simply mirrored in God's declared intent to "disintegrate ... all
flesh" (6:13). The structures are already lost. According to Sanhedrin
108a, "cattle had perverse relations with wild beasts, wild beasts with
cattle, everything with man, and man with everything." If sexuality is a
mode of communication, then a sexual pandemonium has taken over.
Something in the delicate balance of likeness and unlikeness that makes
communication possible has been violently dislocated. In sending the
Flood, the shetefthat deconstructs all differences, God is, in a sense,
merely registering what human beings have made of themselves. Or, to
put the point differently, the Flood is an objective correlative, in T. S.
Eliot's sense, for processes that psychologically and spiritually have long
been under way.
Relevant here is the tradition, which Rashi refers to, that the Flood was
not a single cataclysmic event, but a process. When Enosh was born, "it
was then that men began to invoke the Lord by name" (4:26). This is
interpreted by Rashi to mean that people began to call human beings and
natural phenomena by God's name. At that time, in other words, people
lost the capacity to discriminate between God, man, and nature. A
linguistic rigor was lost. And at that time, by no coincidence, "a third of
the world was flooded by the overflowing ocean" (Rashi, 6:4). This can,
of course, be read as sin and punishment; it can also be read as an
objective correlative for the blunted distinctions and misarticulations, by
which people then defined themselves and their place in the world.
There are several indications in midrashic sources that the Flood was a
process that men and women knew to be under way. In a fascinating

Kindness and Ecstasy
51
midrash, quoted by Rashi, for example, Lamekh's wives refuse to have
sexual relations with him (to "speak" to him), under the plea that
"Tomorrow the Flood will come and wash away everything" (Rashi,
4:24). The Flood is intimated in the lives of men and women and animals,
before Noah's time. Lamekh's wives speak out of a sense of impending
doom— quite literally, apres moiy le delugel They react to the catastrophic
openness of their time by refusing speech, sexuality, entirely. What they
affirm in doing this is that the apparent openness smothers life as fatally
as any prison.
i\.apacions sexuality
At this point, it will be important to look more closely at the sin that
precipitates the Flood, that is the Flood. There is a strange ambiguity in
the midrashic account: on the one hand, Rashi defines the sin as sexual sin
and idolatry ("And the earth was corrupted before God"); on the other,
he defines it as robbery ("And the earth was filled with violence" [6:11]).
The same ambiguity recurs when God speaks to Noah, but this time
Rashi schematizes the situation that precipitates the Flood:
"An end of all flesh": Wherever you find immorality and idolatry,  
indiscriminate punishment—andralamousia—comes to the world and
kills innocent and guilty alike.
"For the earth is filled with violence": The divine decree was sealed
against them only because of robbery (6:13).
The total indiscriminate destruction comes as a response to sexual sin
and idolatry. But it is only because of robbery, disrespect for private
property, that the edict is finally signed and sealed. What does Rashi
intend here, when he aligns sexual immorality with idolatry as the
essential factor, and robbery separately, as the final determinant? We
might suggest that a comment is being made on the nature of the open
sexuality and idolatry of the time, and on the mass destruction that is
commensurate with it. For both sexual sins and idolatry often seem to be
"generous" sins. In them, human beings often experience and express a
yearning to transcend self, to relate to the other. It is no etymological
coincidence that incest and other sexual taboos are called hesedP This is
the modality of expansiveness, impatient of limits and laws, eager to
speak many languages, and know many other selves.

52
NOAH
But the midrashic comment on the sexuality of the Flood generations
reveals a grim counterreality. This is a sexuality of rapacious egotism:
"The divine beings saw how beautiful the daughters of men were and
took wives from among those that pleased them" (6:2). Rashi draws on
the midrash:26
"The divine beings": These are princes who go about the business of
God [Elohim in the Torah has the root meaning of mastery, leadership].
"How beautiful": The word used is tovot— "goodly," written defectively
[without a vav]. When a girl was being prepared and adorned to enter
the hupa [the marriage canopy], the ruler would enter and have  
intercourse with her first.
"From among those that pleased them": Even married women, even males,
even animals.
The sexual temperament of the time is focused vividly in this image.
The bride adorned on her wedding day, about to "enter" her new
condition, to cross a threshold —"A threshold is a sacred thing," wrote
Porphyrus in the third century27 —is snatched away to the bed of the
"great one." This custom—known in later times as iusprimae noctis, the
right to the first night—exemplifies the institutionalization of barbarity.
If we are to speak of passion here, it is the arrogant passion of the self, for
whom no Other exists, in her own subjectivity, her own readiness to open
doors or leave them closed. The ruler simply enters the intimate domains
of others and expresses his mastery. He ignores the sacredness of  
thresholds, the dangers, the hesitations, the temptations, the respect, due to
doors.28 His act of entry is a way of saying, in the words of the midrash:
"Either me or you. . . ."29 It is not an act of love, but an act of robbery.
Richard Rorty discusses the passion of the torturer in similar terms.
Referring to Elaine Scarry's book, The Body in Pain, he speaks of "the
tearing down of the particular structures of language and belief in which
[the victims] were socialized. . . . The worst thing you can do to  
somebody is not to make her scream in agony but to use that agony in such a
way that even when the agony is over, she cannot reconstitute  
herself. . . . You can thereby, as Scarry puts it, 'unmake her world' by
making it impossible for her to use language to describe what she has
been."30
The essential paradigmatic act of sexual sin is thus an act of rapacious
self-assertion, which sweeps away all other "worlds," all other selves.

Kindness and Ecstasy
53
When Rashi says that the verdict against the Flood generation was sealed
only because of the sin of robbery, we can understand him to be describing
the nature of the prevailing sexual fantasy (and idolatrous fantasy) of the
period. This is a fantasy in which self swells to fill all worlds, a colonial
expansionism that radically denies the existence of other worlds of self
and culture. "Either me or you. . . ." Essentially, this is a sexuality of
cruelty, not of erotic relationship. It is a "pursuit of ecstasy which
necessarily excludes attention to other people."31 At base, it is, to use
Rorty5 s term, a "lack of curiosity."32
The context in which these terms occur is a discussion of the work of
Nabokov, and the theme of cruelty as related to the ecstasy-seeking of the
artist. The central question, as Rorty sees it, is whether the obsessional
nature of the artist does not entail a kind of fatal incuriosity, as to anything
irrelevant to his own obsession. Nabokov claims that art is identified with
the compresence of "curiosity, tenderness, kindness, and ecstasy."  
Curiosity, as Rorty notes, comes first.33 But Rorty treats Nabokov's manifesto
as something of a pious hope, rather than a realized assurance. In reality,
Nabokov "fears most . . . that one cannot have it both ways—that there
is no synthesis of ecstasy and kindness."34
lLcstasy and kindness
These motifs provide us with a model that will be helpful in discussing
the dilemma of the Flood generations. The main problem of the time —
called sexual sin—is the very converse of love. Love is to be identified
with curiosity, with that attentiveness to the self-made worlds of others,
which the midrash represents the Flood people as lacking. What we see in
them is the excess of openness, manifested in the "desire to conquer all
reticent beings."35 This is the gezel, the rapacious mode of sexuality.36
When this is the prevailing mode, then mass destruction, indiscriminate
of selves and worlds, comes like a madness and washes away all selves,
innocent and guilty alike.
It is this issue of love-kindness-curiosity, as opposed to obsessive
narcissism, that divides the Flood generation from the Tower of Babel
generation. Rashi, quoting the midrash, asks why the Flood generation is
punished so much more radically, why they are "washed away" (11:9). He
answers by contrasting the "robbery" of the Flood generation with the

54
NOAH
"love and friendship" of the Tower of Babel generation. This, it seems, is
the core of the matter.
It is on this score, of the cruelty that is basically incuriosity, that the
Flood narrative evokes associations with the sin and fate of Sodom. There
are verbal echoes in the two narratives,37 including the use of the word
bamaSy "violent robbery.'' In a provocative passage, the prophet Ezekiel
sketches the Sodom-like character of his own people: "Only this was the
sin of your sister Sodom: arrogance! She and her daughters had plenty of
bread and untroubled tranquillity; yet she did not support [lit., hold the
hand of] the poor and the needy" (16:49). Nahum Sarna writes of the
"callous disregard of the existence of poverty amidst an economy of
plenty."38 Callous disregard is the existential meaning of the sexual
openness of the Flood period, too.
In many midrashic sources, there is a recurrent comment on the long-
term effects of the Flood on the cultural-sexual modalities of future
generations. In the story of the rape of Dinah, for example, her brothers'
anger is explained: "because Shekhem had committed an outrage in
Israel, by lying with Jacob's daughter—a thing not to be done" (34:7).
This phrase — "a thing not to be done" — is explained by Rashi: "to rape
virgins, because the nations of the world had banned [lit., fenced
themselves off from] sexual crimes, as a result of the Flood" Such crimes are
simply "not done" after the Flood. They are taboos, even where an
unmarried woman is concerned, suggests Mizrahi, in his commentary on
Rashi, because of the factor of gezel— of robbery, of violence against her
autonomy, which is expressed in kidnapping and which is punishable by
death.
Rambam, in his legal codex,39 even justifies the massacre of the whole
city of Shekhem, on the basis of the fact that the prince had committed
the crime of gezel— of robbery— and the whole city was silent accessory
to the crime. This is a failure in justice, in the values of privacy and the
rule of law, which became the foundation of the post-Flood era.40 And
Shekhem's act of rape is thus seen as an exceptional rather than a typical
act—"as a result of the Flood."
A similar point is made by Rashi on Jacob's tears when he meets
Rachel for the first time: even a kiss, he fears, will be interpreted as an
outrage against the decencies of the post-Flood ethos: "From the time
that the world was punished by the Flood, all the nations resolved to ban
[fence themselves off from] sexual immorality."41 In similar vein, when

Kindness and Ecstasy
55
Avimelekh kidnaps Sarah, he expresses horror at the "great sin" of
adultery (20:9), in which Abraham almost involved him, by claiming that
Sarah was his sister (and not his wife).
The implication in these and other sources is that a kind of sexual
puritanism was, at least for a certain period, the consequence of the
Flood. Even the animals in the ark restrict themselves to their own kind.
They leave the ark le-mishpehoteihem — "by families" (8:19): the mid-
rashic comment is that the structures of family life, the taboos of  
civilization, are inculcated into the animal world, too, during the twelve-month
period in the ark, so that when they emerge, it is with a changed nature, as
it were —"They left in families —and not themselves."\*2
In these two words ("not themselves" — ve-lo heim), the midrash, it
seems, focuses the essential paradox that Freud describes in Civilization
and Its Discontents—the costs and gains of repression of sexual energy. By
focusing on the animal world, the midrash makes a radical statement
about the transformations and sublimations possible in a new cultural-
spiritual order. The power of the Flood, its destructive disregard of all
privacies, gives rise to an era in which human beings set up voluntary
fences and walls.
But the motive for the new puritanism is fear—a fear of the nihilism
glimpsed in the unfocused expansionism of the Flood era. And the
problem of the Flood generation is, therefore, not resolved; it merely
undergoes metastasis, into different, even opposite forms. For the  
problem of "incuriosity," of "cruelty," in which only self exists, is diagnosed in
the midrash as the arrogance of radical insecurity— "Either me or you."
The obsessions of the self swell to fill the universe; the more they swell,
the more remote they become from any stable ground of being. Human
beings are driven to dominate external space, to act out their vertiginous
freedoms. But vertigo then drives them inwards again, to construct
prison houses of safety from the "mighty waters." These do not cure the
vertigo; they merely exclude it.
The post-Flood generation, the builders of the Tower of Babel, have
as their motto, "Me and not You." They set up safe houses of human
solidarity, which are mere oases in the treacherous and indescribable
world. It is, when all is said, a pathetic avoidance. What neither  
generation can encompass is a world with God at its center, so that one may dare
to imagine a multiplicity of selves, of worlds, existing together, even
interacting with one another in modes that build and do not destroy.

56
NOAH
The radical problem, then, is that of imagining the world. All the
pathologies of openness and closedness relate to imaginative obtuseness.
According to the midrash in Bereshit Rabbah (36:1), the Flood people see
God as blind, indifferent, callous to the world. What follows is that
human beings feel themselves free to be likewise blind, indifferent, and
callous:
"When He is silent, who will condemn? If He hides His face, who will
see Him, be it nation or man?" [Job 34:29]. R. Meir said, "This is what
the generation of the Flood said: He is silent toward His world; He
hides His face from His world, like a judge who has a curtain drawn
over his face, so that he does not know what is happening outside. 'The
clouds screen Him so He cannot see'" [Job 22:14].
God's silence, the curtain of cloud that screens man from His view—
this is a philosophical understanding that justifies human cruelty. If God
either ignores what is happening just beyond His line of sight, as it were,
or if He is shotef hakol— indiscriminately destroys whole generations —
then human society is freed from the yoke of justice and responsibility.
Or, at least, until the terrors of such freedom become so palpable that a
backlash sets in.
To link God's justice in this way with human justice is not, of course,
inevitable. George Eliot's manifesto to a godless world comes to mind:
"She, stirred somewhat beyond her wont, and taking as her text the three
words which have been used so often as the inspiring trumpet-calls of
men—the words, God, Immortality•, Duty — pronounced, with terrible
earnestness, how inconceivable was the first, how unbelievable the second,
and yet how preemptory and absolute the third."\*1
Though not inevitable, however, the Flood people's response has a
desperate logic to it. Their cruelty is indeed the cruelty of despair. Where
such a vision of the world prevails, even "the compassion of the wicked is
cruelty" (Proverbs 12:10). In another midrash, God and human beings
are set in high relief against one another, precisely in relation to this
question of cruelty and kindness:44
"An d God remembered Noah ": It is written, "A righteous man knows the
needs of his beast. But the compassion of the wicked is cruelty." The
Righteous One of the world knows the needs, even of animals, even in
His anger. He is unlike human kings, who send in their legions to quell
a rebellion and kill both innocent and guilty alike—because they do not

57
know rebel from loyal citizen. God, however, even in a generation that
angers Him, saves the one righteous person in the generation: "He
knows the needs of His beast." "But the compassion of the wicked is
cruelty": these are the people of the Flood, who were cruel. The sages
said: When God raised the depths over them, and they saw the  
fountains of the deep threaten to submerge them, what did they do? They
had many children . . . and some of them would take their children
and place them into the depths, pressing them down mercilessly. That
is why it says, "The compassion of the wicked is cruelty." How do we
know? Because Job said, "May the womb forget him; may he be sweet
to the worms; may he be no longer remembered; may wrongdoers be
broken like a tree" [Job 24:20] — his womb [sic!] no longer remembers
that they were his children.
Rashi adds45 that the children were placed under their parents, in
order to "block the openings of the deeps." The violent imagery of
callousness, in which a child —one's own child — becomes a bung against
one's own destruction, represents a failure of memory, of imagination.
One's child is, after all, that being in the world of others in whom one's
own face is reflected. God, by contrast, is exquisitely aware, "knows"; He
can focus on the needs of the righteous man (strangely called "His
beast") among the mass of the wicked. This is the opposite of cruelty— to
know the individual and his needs. It is essentially curiosity, awareness of
the otherness of the other. The animal imagery suggests the difference—
the lower order—represented by man's reality and God's. Yet He focuses
His attention and concern on "His beast."
The analogy is, of course, particularly appropriate in a context where
Noah has earned the loving attention of God, precisely by his own loving
attention to the animals. Here we can recall the midrash, quoted earlier,
in which the traveler meets "one" on his journey, seeks his company to
the point of giving him his daughter in marriage, and teaches him
wisdom—which animal is to be fed at the second hour of the day, and
which at the third hour of the night.46 We noticed that the King's
daughter in midrashic symbolism is often a figure for Wisdom. God gives
Noah, in token of His love, wisdom —the wisdom to know the feeding
schedules of the animals! The anticlimax is palpable. But what looks like a
bathetic ending to a midrash that is clearly designed on a principle of
intensification in fact makes, possibly, the most important point of all
about Noah and his relation to the world.

58
NOAH
silence
At this point, and before we discuss Noah's role in the ark, we can return
to the questions we raised earlier about Noah's involvement in the death
sentence imposed on his world. Noah is indeed a man of his world and his
time. He shares in the prevailing pathology; he is saved more for what he
may be than for what he is.
If we are in any doubt about who Noah is, we have only to consider the
central fact of his silence. From beginning to end of the Flood narrative,
Noah says not a word. God talks to him twice before the Flood, telling of
what is to come, telling him how to build the ark, to enter it with his
family and representatives of the animal world. And after each of God's
long speeches (6:13—21; 7:1 -4), the text tells us impassively, "And Noah
did just as the Lord commanded him" (6:22; 7:5). Rashi distinguishes
between the two acts of obedience: the first time, he obeyed by building
the ark, the second time by entering it. But the impact of Noah's silent
acquiescence in the destruction of the world is devastating.
His "unqualified apathy," as Andre Neher calls it,47 is not largely
mitigated by the midrashic scenario, which has him building the ark over
120 years—a process that begins with planting the cedars that are to
provide wood for the ark, so that they may become a topic of general
conversation and lead to the rebuke and repentance of his  
contemporaries.48 Even in this midrash, Noah's imaginative solipsism is clear: he
tells his interlocutors, "God intends to bring a Flood on the world, and
told me to make an ark, so that I and my household may escape." It is not
surprising that he is not effective in swaying his contemporaries. His
silence is the reverse image of their babble.49
Noah's silence, I suggest, is essentially a metastasis of the sickness of
his time. He is incurious, he does not know and does not care what
happens to others. He suffers from the incapacity to speak meaningfully
to God or to his fellow human beings. He, too, is imprisoned by the
"mighty waters," even though his prison takes the form of a small,
enclosed, safe space.
Just here, however, is the paradoxical arena of Noah's transformation.
Within the intimate but teeming space of the ark, Noah becomes, in the
midrashic view, a new person—effectively, and retroactively, a person
whom the Torah can describe as a tzaddik, a righteous man: "Said R.
Levi, 'Even the mill stones were obliterated in the water—and yet you say,

Kindness and Ecstasy
59
"And the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were" [9:18]? But Noah
saw a new world.' ["Were" is understood as indicating new being.] . . .
The Rabbis said, 'Anyone of whom it is said, 'He was,9 is a feeder, a life
sustained "50
The midrash treats Noah as one among five cases of people who are
described as "seeing a new world," on the one hand, and "feeding and
sustaining," on the other. To see a new world, in the case of Joseph, or
Moses, or Job, or Mordecai, is to be understood metaphorically; these
men underwent radical changes of fortune, so that their entire  
perspective on the world was transformed. In the case of Noah, of course, quite
literally, the world itself was transformed around him. And yet even in his
case, the midrash is to be read as a comment on Noah's subjective vision.
Even the massive mill stones were turned to water. How could Noah be, in
such a world of "mighty waters," if it were not that he was profoundly
changed? When he comes out of the ark, he no longer belongs to the
babble of the waters, nor to the silence of the withdrawal. And what has
changed him is suggested in the second part of the midrash. "He was"
means that he became a feeder and a life sustainer.
Noah as life sustainer
The core of the ark experience is Noah's relation to the animals he brings
with him, "to keep alive with you" (6:19). When God speaks to Noah the
first time, He tells him to do three things: to build the ark, to enter it with
his family, and to bring into it representatives of the animal world. The
culmination of God's speech is the last verse (6:21): "For your part [ve-
ata], take of everything that is eaten and store it away, to serve as food
for you and for them." "For your part" — ve-ata—parallels the "For My
part"—ve-ani— of 6:17. God's role is to bring the Flood: Noah's role is
complementary, even contrapuntal. He is to prepare food, for human
beings and for animals. "Noah did so; just as God commanded him, so he
did" (6:22). He takes food for all, but kah lekha—literally, "Take for
yourself" — though an idiom, introduces the suggestion that feeding the
animals will be in some sense conducive to his own welfare.
Bereshit Rabbah engages in a serious discussion of the type of food
Noah brings into the ark.51 One view is that he brought pressed figs, an
acceptable neutral diet for men and animals. ("Food for you and for
them" indicates a single diet for both.) But another view is that he

60
NOAH
brought a different, individual diet for each species. ("For you and for
them" indicates specific, individual foods for each species, with the
human diet primary.) Ultimately, the midrash concludes, "You shall
store it away for yourself \*" (literal translation) indicates that "No one
brings something in [lit.], unless he has need of it."
All the feeding that Noah does in the ark, all the varieties of food that
he stores there, all have to do with the question of need— in the obvious
sense, the animals' need, but ultimately, his need. To "bring something
in" is to satisfy need —the basic model is the human body, with its
apertures, through which vital requirements are absorbed. And yet,
paradoxically, in this and in many other versions of the midrashic narra-
tive, all attention is focused on the variations and details of the animals'
needs.
In Tanhuma 2, for instance, the animals are fed not only the kinds of
food they are used to, but at the times they are used to. Here, we recall the
midrash about the traveler who teaches his new-found friend the acme of
wisdom ("marries him to his daughter")—the timing of animal meals.
Here, too, the prooftext is, "A wise man captivates people" (lit., takes
souls) (Proverbs 11:30). This refers, claims the midrash, to Noah, who
fed and sustained the cattle. Noah's wisdom is demonstrated in his
painstaking, detailed knowledge of the feeding schedules of every species
within the ark. "For twelve months in the ark, he had not a wink of sleep,
neither by day nor by night, for he was occupied in feeding the creatures
who were with him —'The wise man takes souls/ "
It is clear that Noah plays a God-like role in "feeding the creatures."
Like God, he is the type of the "righteous man, who knows the needs of
his beast" (Proverbs 12:10). We have discussed the kind of concern, of
curiosity, that according to Tanhuma 7 God demonstrates, by contrast to
the cruelty of the Flood people. The knowledge of the tzaddik is focused
on the needs (lit., the soul) of the animal. In another midrash (Tanhuma
5), Noah as tzaddik is defined specifically by his "feeding the creatures of
God." To be a righteous man is to care for and provide the needs of all
creatures—like God Himself. But the basis of such concern is spelled out
in our midrash: to be able to feed, one must have not simply sterling
character, but a kind of curiosity, a kind of wisdom.
The animals are the prototype objects of this kind of nurturing
knowledge. Without verbal communication, the righteous man is still
expected to intuit the dumb world of the Other. He is defined by his

Kindness and Ecstasy
61
capacity to nurture the needy, with the right food, at the right moment.
The knowing of need is the highest measure of that curious, tender
concern that characterizes God and God-like man.
In a startling comment on "the needs of his beast," Rashi explains,
"What his cattle and his family need." He is not inhibited about equating
cattle and human beings under the basic rubric of need. "Your justice is
like the great deep; man and beast You deliver, O Lord" (Psalms 36:7).
Here, again, Rashi emphasizes that there is no shame in the animal needs
of the whole human being; indeed, there is an existential realism and
humility, in the recognition of these needs.
For the relation of a human being to his needs can be a matter of joy
and affirmation of life. Emmanuel Levinas writes:
Nourishment as a means of invigoration, is the transmutation of the
other into the same, which is in the essence of enjoyment: an energy
that is other, recognized as other . . . becomes, in enjoyment, my own
energy, my strength, me. All enjoyment is in this sense  
alimentation. . . . The bare fact of life is never bare. Life is not the naked will to
be, an ontological Sorge for this life. Life's relation with the very
conditions of its life becomes the nourishment and content of that life.
Life is love of life, a relation with contents that are not my being but
more dear than my being: thinking, eating, sleeping, reading, working,
warming oneself in the sun. Distinct from my substance but  
constituting it, these contents make up the worth [prix] of my life. . . . The
human being thrives on his needs; he is happy for his needs. . . .
Happiness is made up not of an absence of needs, whose tyranny and
imposed character one denounces, but of the satisfaction of all
needs. . . . Happiness is accomplishment: it exists in a soul satisfied
and not in a soul that has extirpated its needs, a castrated soul.52
Ultimately, the relation of Noah to the animals' needs is symbolic of
the relation of the self to its own needs, to its most real and intimate
interactions with the other. To be hungry and eat is to experience
enjoyment and power—the independence of "a subject capable of  
ensuring the satisfaction of its needs."53 The very concrete animal quality
of the need for food generates the sense of personal potency.
The traditional midrashic view is that sexuality receives no expression
in the ark. Instead, there is feeding, the acute awareness of timing and
taste in nurturing the other. I suggest that feeding animals becomes a
year-long workshop in the kindness that Rorty defined as "curiosity."

62
NOAH
The sexual area is too dangerous, for the time being: too much abuse, too
much cruelty has become part of its essential fantasy. Feeding animals,
too, however, can be dangerous. The midrash, quoted by Rashi (7:23),
depicts Noah as injured by a lion when he is late with its meal. Dealing
with the Other is never safe, apparently. His "alterity" (Levinas's term) is
essential and irreducible; yet, as Levinas puts it, "it is visible only from
an I." All the feeding, the storing of foods, the exquisite concern and
attentiveness, are ultimately functions of Noah's relation with his own
needs.54 The "I" of Noah is being trained to an alertness that makes sleep
impossible ("He never tasted the taste of sleep!"55). He gives food to the
animals and gains enjoyment for himself. His work is altruistic and
nurtures his own sense of potency.
j&Jndness and ecstasy
Over twelve months, the ark becomes a crucible in which a new type of
sensibility is nurtured. It is a closed interior, cut off from the raging
waters outside. Entering this interior is not simple. Many midrashic
sources stress the difficulty of God's command, "You shall enter the ark"
(6:18): the smallness of the ark for so many inhabitants,56 Noah's delay
until the water is lapping around his ankles,57 the attacks by enraged
contemporaries, of giant size and force.58 "You shall enter the ark" can be
read as a promise, rather than a command59 — an assurance that Noah will
find the strength needed for this entry. And Rashi reads the second
statement of Noah's obedience—"Noah did just as God commanded
him" (7:5)—as referring simply to the act of entry, in all its apparent
banality.
It seems that Noah senses great danger in this entry, a cutting-off from
all previous experience. Gaston Bachelard writes evocatively of the power
of doors:
Is there one of us who hasn't in his memories a Bluebeard chamber that
should not have been opened, even half-way? Or—which is the same
thing for a philosophy that believes in the primacy of the imagination—
that should not even have been imagined open, or capable of opening
half-way?. . . . [The poet] knows that there are two "beings" in a door,
that a door awakens in us a two-way dream, that it is doubly symbolical.60

Kindness and Ecstasy
63
Indeed, the narrative emphasizes, after the several variations of the
clause, "Noah came into the ark," "And God shut him in" (7:16). An
ambiguous slam of the door, protecting, imprisoning. Claustrophobia
sets in, as we read of all the animal flesh, male and female, enclosed with
Noah for twelve months. All this flesh is to be seen by him, in one sense,
as his own flesh, its needs are to be his needs: "to keep alive with you"
(6:19). The ark is to be a laboratory of kindness, of attentiveness to the
needs and the enjoyment that are, in Levinas's terms, the "contents of
life." But how does Noah deal with the claustrophobia, the sense of being
cut off from that other world that Rorty defines as one in which "ecstasy"
is pursued? Are the two modalities incompatible—kindness, curiosity,
attentiveness to others as other, on the one hand, and ecstasy, obsession,
at worst, cruelty, on the other?
Midrash Tanhuma, as we have seen, imagines Noah's constant prayer
to have been "Release my soul from enclosure" (Psalms 142:8). This, in
fact, becomes a leitmotif in the Tanhuma narrative: the paradox of
Noah's desire to be free of the ark, on the one hand, and his reluctance to
leave, on the other. God has closed him in. When He tells Noah, finally,
"Come out of the ark" (8:16), He means a most intimate form of
release — a release from the sexual abstinence, the nonecstatic modality of
the ark.61 Noah has prayed for this release, yet he refuses it, on the
grounds of his apprehension that further floods may sweep away all his
efforts to live at the margins of ecstasy. There is an unresolved dilemma in
Noah's consciousness: between openness and closedness, between the
mighty waters of ecstasy and the alert attentiveness of kindness.
When he prays, "Release my soul from enclosure," he expresses his
claustrophobia at being entirely committed to the feeding of others. The
Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer version of the narrative62 paraphrases the meaning
of his prayer: "for my soul is weary of the smell of the lions and the bears."
A profound angst cries from these words. It is not simply a physical
weariness that afflicts him, the unremitting rigor of a feeding schedule
that never allows him a "taste of sleep." The smell of the animals, in the
final analysis, unnerves him. The sense of smell evokes intimations,
essences of an experience. To be totally present to the needs of the
animals—this is the very meaning of the ark experience. Within the
density and compression of the ark, multiple relationships and forms of
knowledge open up. And yet, through that very saturation in the feeding

64
NOAH
mode, Noah becomes achingly aware of a "weariness," a fatigue that
dreams of another way of being. "O God!" says Hamlet, "I could be
bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it
not that I have bad dreams."63
The
two-way dream
Noah's dream is a dream of the door, the window, the opening. God
closes him in; nothing is left of the world but what is inside the Ark: "Only
Noah and those with him in the ark" survive (7:23). But, adds Pirkei
d'Rabbi Eliezer, with magnificent disregard for the apparent clarities of
the text, Og, the king of Bashan, also survived. He "sat on a plank of the
ladders of the ark, and swore to Noah and his sons that he would be a slave
to them for ever. What did Noah do? He pierced a hole in the ark, and
handed him his food every day, so that he too survived."64 Through the
giant Og, the race of giants survives the Flood, the race of lordly,
rapacious heroes, who recognized no bar to their pursuit of ecstasy.65 Og,
too, must survive, if Noah is to survive in that "half-open" form that
Gaston Bachelard describes so evocatively:
For the door is an entire cosmos of the Half-open. In fact, it is one of its
primal images, the very origin of a daydream that accumulates desires
and temptations: the temptation to open up the ultimate depths of
being, and the desire to conquer all reticent beings. The door  
schematizes two strong possibilities, which sharply classify two types of  
daydream. At times, it is closed, bolted, padlocked. At others, it is open,
that is to say, wide open.
But then come the hours of greater imagining sensibility. On May
nights, when so many doors are closed, there is one that is just barely
ajar. We have only to give it a very slight push! The hinges have been
well oiled. And our fate becomes visible.66
"There are two 'beings' in a door, [it] awakens in us a two-way dream."
Noah must enter the ark, cut himself off from the world and discover the
closed daydream, with its "temptation to open up the ultimate depths of
being." But, "in hours of greater imaginary sensibility," he must pierce a
hole in the ark, must feed the giant, who now swears eternal subjugation
to the domain of kindness. The opening in the ark acts as a kind of valve,
regulating the flow of nourishment from Noah to the giant. Implicitly,

Kindness and Ecstasy
65
however, the flow is not all one way; Noah perforates the shell of his safety
to maintain relations with the giant who is outside and inside.
The most significant use of the opening in the ark's surface occurs
when, after forty days, Noah "opened the window of the ark that he had
made and sent out the raven" (8:6-7). The "window," Rashi identifies
with the tzohar, the "opening for daylight," which Noah had built into
the ark from the first (6:16). This is distinct from "the opening of the ark,
which is made for coming in and going out." After the raven fails to
return, Noah sends out the dove, "to see whether the waters had  
decreased from the surface of the ground" (8:8). The verb, "sent out," is
explained by Rashi: "This is not the word for 'sending a messenger/ but
for 'sending off on its way.' The bird is set free, and thus Noah will see if
the waters have decreased — for if she finds a resting place, she will not
return."
Rashi makes a subtle point here. The dove is not being sent to fulfill a
mission, to "see" the world and report. Noah simply releases her to act as
is natural to her. It is Noah who will "see" from her behavior what is the
reality outside the ark. In other words, the dove represents a kind of
communications system: Noah is mobilizing a symbolic language, by
which he may make statements about the world. For this, he needs an
"opening" in the ark, an expression of his need to read what he cannot
empirically see. When the dove finally returns with the torn olive leaf in
her mouth, Noah "knew" that the waters had abated. This is a knowledge
with no practical effect. Noah makes no move to leave the ark, until he is
told to do so. But he must "see," he must "know."
What the opening in the ark suggests, in fact, is the growth of a new,
human, sensibility: Noah "sees a new world." In the narrative of the dove,
we find, for the first time, a self-awareness, a consciousness of expectation
and disappointment, as Noah trains his eyes on the hole that perforates
his box (the literal meaning of teiva—usually translated "ark.") The
word, va-yahel— "he waited another seven days" —is repeated (8:10, 12):
for the first time, we are given a sense of human loneliness, as time is
endured, as Noah waits for something new to begin. The word contains
nuances of "anticipation." But, as Samson Raphael Hirsch suggests
(8:12), the second va-yahel (because of its passive niphal form) actually
conveys a contrary mood: he was disappointed in his expectations.
The flickering of hope and disillusion through time is conveyed here
for the first time in the Torah. Noah, cut off, plumbing the depths of his

66
NOAH
being, measures time—again, as no one has before —by the years of his
life. The Flood is his private history: "In the six hundredth year of Noah's
life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that
day, all the fountains of the great deep burst apart" (7:11). "In the six
hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the
waters began to dry from the earth" (8:13). The objective date is  
controversial: is the first month Tishrei or Nisan?67 The perspective is  
subjective: Noah suffers the Flood, it is he who needs both to experience the
inwardness of the ark and to devise ways of seeing what is unseen beyond
its opening.
m and Noah: building and contemplating
Noah's "half-open" condition is a new variation on a theme whose
classical form is articulated in an earlier narrative. Eve was created from
one of Adam's ribs. There, too, there was a cutting and a closing. It was
God who put Adam to sleep. With man unconscious, God removed a part
of him, closed the flesh over the incision, and "built" the rib into a woman
(2:21-22). Man was separated from himself so that he hardly knew of his
loss, until he met it face to face. It was God who did the cutting, the
closing, and the building.
The building—va-yiven — is the subject of important punning in the
midrash: "This teaches that God gave superior Una—understanding—to
woman over man."68 The root, "to build/understand," evokes a kind of
knowledge in which one constructs from what is merely implicit in a
given situation. For example, in another midrash, God "contemplates
from what organ to create Eve — not from the head, so that she should not
be haughty, not from the eye, so that she should not be inquisitive etc."69
God intuits the implications for the future of the choices of the present.
Something not yet present is to be evolved; for this,  
bina—understanding— is required. (In the terms of this midrash, the characteristic desired
by God is modesty.)
All this happens while Adam is unconscious. When he meets woman
for the first time, he knows she is bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, but
has no idea of the processes, the choices, the incisions and closures that
have gone into her making. With Noah, the theme is replayed with
significant variations. Now, it is Noah who has to "enter" the ark and cut
himself off from the world—in fact, from a part of himself. It is God who
J\da

Kindness and Ecstasy
67
closes him in, seals him from infection and an overpowering sense of loss.
But Noah does not sleep—not a wink, insists the midrash—he is conscious
during the entire twelve-month operation. And, as we have seen, he is not
really sealed. He is ajar, half-open, committed to the ark, and to all "who
are with him,, —the repeated phrase describes his attentiveness and alert
kindness —but also discovering in his vision of his lost world a wonder in
alienation that was not his, when he lived a citizen in that world.
For now, the building/contemplating response is his, not God's. The
result of the whole ark experience, imprisonment and release, is  
crystallized in that one word, va-yiven — "And Noah built an altar to the Lord"
(8:20). He meets his world as he emerges from the ark, like Adam meeting
Eve with the gratitude and wonder, with the "wild surmise"70 of  
encountering a part of himself grown immeasurably more valuable in its new
otherness.
But Noah, unlike Adam, is conscious; it is he who "constructs" the
experience. "He contemplated — 'Why did God command me to bring
more pure than impure animals into the ark? —if not to offer sacrifices
from them?' "71 "He searched his heart, and said, 'God has saved me
from the waters of the Flood and brought me out of that enclosure — am I
not obliged to offer Him sacrifices and burnt offerings?'"72 In both
versions of the midrash, Noah explores the implications of the known, to
arrive at what has not, in fact, been told him. He discovers the capacity to
read the text of God's words, in the first version. Or—in the second
version—he learns to read the text of his own most intimate experience:
he "searches his heart" for what he must do, for what is entailed in the
story of his double salvation. Neither of those "strong possibilities" that
Bachelard schematizes through the imagery of the door—padlocked, or
wide open—is the home of his soul, in "hours of greater imaginary
sensibility." God has saved him both from the "waters of the Flood" and
from "that enclosure." And Noah "builds" his response to the  
implications of that double escape.
Noab enlarged
There is a peculiar aptness to Noah's response. One who is saved from
prison, one who has been "brought out" into the air and the light,
celebrates his redemption by an act of consciousness: "I am the man who
has known affliction" (Lamentations 3:1). Unlike Adam, who slept

68
NOAH
through both opening and closing, Noah builds his world by  
understanding it. The dynamic is perhaps most clearly presented in the Psalmist's
cry: uO peoples, bless our God, celebrate His praises; who has granted us
life, and has not let our feet slip. . . . You have caught us in a net, caught
us in trammels. . . . We have endured fire and water, and You have
brought us through to prosperity. I enter Your house with burnt  
offerings, I pay my vows to You, vows that my lips pronounced, that my mouth
uttered in my distress" (Psalms 66:8-14). The Psalmist directly relates
his entrapment, enclosure, and release, his coming in and coming out—
the Hebrew text is subtly transfused with the root words for entry and
exit73—with the act of sacrifice — burnt offerings, the voluntary "coming
in" to the House of God,
But why are burnt offerings, specifically, the instinctive response of
both Noah and the Psalmist? Would a thanks-offering (shelamim) not
have been more plausible? One answer is suggested by Radal, quoting the
Zohar.74 Noah offers burnt offerings (which are considered as atonement
for wayward motions of the heart) because of his apprehension during his
time in the ark, that he would be left in the lurch, that he had, in a sense,
exhausted all his credit with God in being saved from the Flood. Noah
now acknowledges the complex love of God that transcends the simplistic
expectations of human beings. Caught between openness and closedness,
Noah suffered despair: perhaps God can save only in the mode of closure,
of kindness? Perhaps Noah is not sufficiently versatile to be saved from
his own salvation? In the wonder of release, Noah's gratitude is irradiated
with a desire to atone for the meagerness of his faith.
The Psalmist speaks of past speech: "that my lips pronounced, that my
mouth uttered in my distress." "In my distress" (lit., in my narrowness)
suggests the pressure of a condition in which one can imagine no  
enlargement. What Noah experiences, when he is released, is the subtle  
gratitude of one who now realizes the implications of where he was and where
he is. The burnt offering articulates the evolution of consciousness that is
now part of the human repertoire.
The history of Noah is, then, the history of man's first exercise in self-
construction. Between the worlds of kindness and ecstasy, between
closedness and openness, Noah reads and interprets the texts of God's
words and of his own heart. "These are the generations of Noah:
Noah. . . ." Noah is his own primary creation. Midrashic commentary
on Noah's narrative is filled with references to the problems and privi-

69
leges of interpretation, translation, word play, to the whole area of the
Oral Law, of what the mouth may say, as it engages in the complex act
called "reading." "The unexamined life is not worth living," said  
Socrates. With Noah and his children, self-criticism, searchings of the heart
and of the words of God, become a measure of the life that is worth living.
XTxurnan infancy and "transitional space"
The end of Noah's story is his first speech (9:25-27). Noah's only words
come close after he has drunk the wine that celebrates his return to the
world of ecstasy. He sleeps —for the first time in twelve months? —and
unspeakable things are done to him by Ham, his son. He wakes, he
knows, and he curses and blesses his children. Instead of the wicked being
destroyed by God, they are from this point on described by man. Noah,
dumb till now, takes over God's role of blessing and cursing. He declares
his commitment to a certain model of reality, in which he recognizes the
variables of "less" and "more." (Conceptually, "blessing" is the modality
of "more," while "cursing" is the modality of "less.") In other words, he
composes a world: it is "as though he made himself."75
After the Flood, God looks with new, almost inexplicable tolerance on
the very problem of intrinsic evil that had precipitated destruction just a
year before: "The Lord smelled the pleasing odor [of the sacrifices], and
the Lord said to Himself: Never again will I doom the earth because of
man, since the devisings of mans mind are evil from his youth" (8:21).76
Rabbenu Bahya offers a compelling reading of this diagnosis of the
human condition:77
The Sages have said, " 'From his youth' means, 'from the time that he
shakes himself free [nin 'ar puns on ne'urav, "youth"] from his mother's
womb.' "78 Evil enters him from that moment on. It is known that a
man is not obligated to keep the commandments (which are addressed to
the good inclination) until the age of thirteen. That is why the Sages said,
"The evil inclination is older than the good intention by thirteen years!"79
And that is why Solomon said, "Better a poor but wise youth ... for [he]
can emerge from a dungeon to become king" [Ecclesiastes 4:13-14].
From the time he leaves the womb, where he was incarcerated like a man
in prison—immediately, he wants to rule. He seeks out the nipple and is
drawn after his desires.

70
NOAH
In Bahya's reading, man is seen as an evolving being. God looks at the
post-Flood generation as a new and more hopeful infancy. It is true that
"evil" —that is, the energy of powerful and uncompromising desires—is
at its strongest at this stage. But the prospect of maturity is the reward of
an evolutionary view of man. Human history is still in its infancy; the
arrogance of the libido is expressed in an oral mode (even the nipple is
called the "mouth of the breast"!), as the new-born seeks to attach
everything to itself, to "become king." George Eliot uses the same
metaphor to describe the process by which human beings grow out of
moral "stupidity" to the realization that the world is not "an udder to
feed our supreme selves."80
In a sense, Noah is reborn Adam. He emerges from the womb-prison
and, in one midrashic view, he proceeds to make exactly the same
mistakes that the first Adam made. "Noah, the tiller of the soil, was the
first to plant a vineyard" (9:20). The Babylonian Talmud, in Sanhedrin
70a, has God reproach Noah: " 'Noah, should you not have learned from
the first Adam, whose fate befell him only because of wine?' So we learn
that the tree Adam ate of was the vine." Another midrash notes that from
being called a "righteous man," he is now called an am ba-aretz, an
ignoramus (lit., an earthy man—see 9:20): "God said to him, 'What are
you doing in a vineyard? Was not Adam punished with mortality, just
because of wine?' "81
The difference between Adam and Noah is precisely this —that Noah
has Adam's narrative as his text to decipher. He has undertaken the task of
construction, the work of the Oral Law, which speaks what is not written.
It is the task of reading. If he sins, because of his "lateness," his sin
has something of the character of a "misreading." "He was the first—
va-yihal— to plant a vineyard." In many midrashic renderings, the  
expression is understood as something like, "He construed profanely,"
or, in Rashi's version, "He made himself profane."
Noah comes as the second Adam; he sees a new world, but he  
remembers the old world, he has a sense of the choices that have gone to the
making of his evolving identity. God's new-found tolerance may be a
function of just this new self-awareness of man. For if it is emotional
stupidity to treat the world as an udder, it is at the same time an essential
phase of human growth. D. W. Winnicott writes of the illusion of the
infant that he creates and controls the breast. This illusory omnipotence
of the small being who has just emerged from a dungeon and imagines

Kindness and Ecstasy
71
himself king is a sine qua non of healthy growth. Only if the infant has
been given sufficient opportunity for illusion can he be successfully
disillusioned. Physically, the child is weaned; emotionally, he comes to
recognize objective reality and his own unkingly place in it. Yet in the
space between breast and the world, which Winnicott calls "transitional
space," the child learns to play, to construct the "transitional  
phenomena" that link him with both mother and world. This is the area of culture
that partakes of imagination and reality, tenderness and ecstasy.82 And
this area is Noah's invention, as he chooses meanings, identities, versions
of a world that is new and old at the same time.

The starting point
The story of Abraham is both beginning and end. Here begins the drama
of the central family-nation of the Torah; here ends the prehistory, the
rough drafts of God's intent. One such essay in creation had ended in
exile (Adam driven from the Garden), the second in destruction (the
Flood).
The first important phase of his life is introduced by God's command:
"Go forth from your native land, from your birthplace, and from your
father's house to the land that I will show you" (Genesis 12:1). There is
no indication of circumstance, of previous encounter. Only a short
preface, in which family context is sketched out:
When Terah had lived 70 years, he begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Now this is the line of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran;
72

Travails of Faith
73
and Haran begot Lot. Haran died in the lifetime of his father Terah,
in his native land, Ur of the Chaldeans. Abram and Nahor took to
themselves wives, the name of Avram's wife being Sarai and that of
Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and
Iscah. Now Sarai was barren, she had no child. Terah took his son
Abram, his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law
Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and they set out together from Ur of
the Chaldeans for the land of Canaan; but when they had come as far as
Haran, they settled there. (11:26-31)
Against the flow of generations of chapter 11 — "This is the line of
Shem. . . ." (11:10) —is set the central absence of Abraham's life: "Sarai
was barren, she had no child" (11:30). Toledot, the word translated here as
"line" and more commonly as "generations," is rich with a sense of the
power of generation, of the multiple birthings, the realized consequences
of potentialities inherent in each lifespan. And, ironically, it is the root of
this word {vlad) that is used to refer to Sarai's childlessness: it is precisely
this that she has not: the vlad that is the barest notation for some
expression of self that lives on beyond self, an essence projected toward
eternity.
"She had no child" — ein la vlad— the three pungent Hebrew words are
freighted with irony. For this significant pair are marked by an emptiness,
while all the "dying generations" (Yeats) effortlessly reproduce  
themselves. This is essentially the business of all other lives, as each generation
enacts an identical ritual: the individual, generated by his father, lives a
specified number of years; he then generates, projects a version of self
beyond self, after which he lives a further tally of years and produces
"sons and daughters." In this scheme, a central act of self-propagation is
flanked by a period of immaturity and by a historically insignificant
period of biological fertility. The expectation built up by the repeated
formula is brought to a head in the almost feverish emphasis on Terah's
generativeness: clearly, the narrative is closing in on its focus.
But here the rhythm changes: there is death (not the natural kind, but
before the shocked face of the father [11:28]), and there is sterility. The
resounding negation ein la vlad cruelly confirms: what was expected as
part of the natural thrust of existence is not. Here, the language of the
Torah enacts what Bergson calls "the peculiar possibility of the  
negative." In nature, Bergson argues, there are no negative conditions; only in
the realm of consciousness, of desire and expectation, disappointment

74
LEKH LEKHA
and frustration, does the knowledge of the negative exist. Memory and
imagination attach to a phantom object, in this case the vlad, the  
offspring, which bestrides positive reality and cries out ein— "no!" "Every
human action has its starting-point in a dissatisfaction, and thereby in a
feeling of absence."1
The "human action" of Abram and Sarai begins in this absence. The
midrash expresses this paradox of generation as follows: "Wherever it is
written 'Ein la—there is not,' there essentially is."2 A similar comment is
made on the poignant leitmotif of absence in Lamentations: ein la
menahem—"there is none to comfort her" (1:2); ein av—"we have  
become orphans, fatherless" (5:3). In the latter case, Midrash Rabbah refers
to the paradigm of Esther, who is fatherless and motherless, and  
therefore is nurtured to a singular sensibility of absence and hope (Esther 2:7).
What is suggested here in this first human experience of ein3 is a new and
difficult mode of being and having: absence leads a man and a woman to
travel far in search of a realization of self that comes effortlessly to those
who preceded and surrounded them.
j\.bram?s wanderings
Here begins the journey of Lekh lekha (12:1) —with its strange order of
abandonments—first land, then community ("moladetkha" — again, the
vlad root: "Leave that which produced you as one possible realization of
its potential"), and, finally, father's house. For the first time, a journey is
undertaken not as an act of exile and diminution (Adam, Cain, and the
dispersed generation of Babel), but as a response to a divine imperative
that articulates and emphasizes displacement as its crucial experience.
For what is most striking here is the indeterminacy of the journey. What
is left behind, canceled out, is defined, clearly circled on the map of
Abram's being; but his destination is merely "the land that I shall show
you": from "your land," the landscape of your basic self-awareness, to a
place that you will know only when the light falls on it with a difference.
There is some discussion in the commentaries about the extent of
Abram's knowledge of his destination. Ramban considers the possibility
that Abram knows from the beginning that his destination is Canaan,
since his father began a family journey to that destination, which was
interrupted and resumed by Abram at this point after his father's death
(11:31). However, the other possibility, radical and disturbing in its

Travails of Faith
75
implications, is that Abram has no idea of his destination when the call
comes to him.
"To the land that I shall show you"\ he wandered aimlessly from nation to
nation and kingdom to kingdom, till he reached Canaan, when God
told him, "To your seed I shall give this land" (12:7). This was the
fulfillment of "to the land that I will show you," and therefore he
settled there. . . . Before that, he did not yet know that that land was
the subject of the command. . . . That is why he later said to  
Avimelekh, "God made me wander from my father's house" (20:13). For
indeed, he wandered like a lost lamb.4
On this view, Abram wanders from place to place, till God "appears"
to him and, in a revelation that includes Godhead and Land, "shows" him
the place of destination. ("And he built an altar there to the Lord who had
appeared to him" [12:7].) This reading is powerfully underwritten by the
verse, quoted by Ramban, in which Abraham himself sums up his life on
the road, in his apologia to Avimelekh: "So when God made me wander
from my father's house . . ." (20:13). Ramban hears in the word hitu
("made me wander") a resonance of the poignant image in Psalms: "I
have strayed like a lost sheep; search for Your servant" (119:176). The
Psalmist cries out of his sense of imperiled contingency. His journey is
trackless, unmapped; but his cry evokes the ultimate responsibility of the
absent Shepherd to choreograph a meeting with His lost sheep. The
disoriented consciousness of the Psalmist retains a core sense of relation-
in-absence: he concludes his appeal, "for I have not forgotten Your
commandments."
What Ramban evokes here is an Abraham who is set on a course of
total displacement, a series of encounters with mekomot, geocultural
environments to be entered, known, and left.5 This directionless  
traveling is in one sense a travailing that is intimately connected with the quest
for birth. The Oxford English Dictionary glosses travel: "1. torment,
distress, suffer afflictions, suffer pains of parturition. 2. make a journey,
from one place to another."
Rashi, too, seems to understand the nature of Abraham's journey in
this way: "When God took me out of my father's house to be a vagrant,
roaming from place (makom) to place. . . . Anyone who is exiled from his
place {makom) and is not settled is called a wanderer" (20:13). Even the
plural verb, strangely used for "made me wander" (hitu), suggests a

76
LEKH LEKHA
plurality of mekomot, of existential frames of being, lacking coherent
connection in an unmapped universe. Rashi's final prooftext, "They
wander about without food" (Job 38:41), suggests the full paradox of a
vital (and in that sense tensely focused) quest, enacted in empirical
randomness.6
Midrash Tanhuma espouses this view of Abram's first trial: "Is there
a man who travels without knowing to what destination [makom] he
travels?"7 A journey without apparent destination: absurdity at each step.
The midrash gives us mocking voices that weave through Abram's  
consciousness as he travels: "Look at this old man! Traveling through the
country, looking like a madman!"8
If the experience of indeterminacy is of the essence of this first trial of
Abram (called in the midrash "the test within a test" —the heart of
darkness within the travail of lekh lekha), then it is echoed hauntingly and
even more explicitly in the mystery of his last trial, that other lekh lekha of
the Binding of Isaac (22:2). Abraham is to take his son, Isaac, the long-
delayed fruition of his longing, and sacrifice him on one of the mountains,
"which I shall tell you." For three days he travels "to the place [makom] of
which God had told him" (22:3). What is this "place"? Does God name
the place? Then why the indeterminacy of the original demand? Or does
he travel to No Place, to the place that God has told him He has not yet
told him?
Abraham's life of vital experience ("God put Abraham to the test"
[22:1] —nissa is trial, experiment, the knowing of self in muscular action)
is thus framed by journeys that are travails of contingency, knowing what
it means not (yet) to be shown, to be told.
Barrenness and alienation
"Sarai was barren" — the barrenness of Sarai evokes the other meaning of
the word akara: the couple is uprooted, the ground cut from under their
feet. Voluntarily, they respond to a call to alienation from all that gives
self a placement in the world. By removing themselves from the normal
conditions of fruitfulness, they—at least on the face of things—cut off
vital sources of nourishment, doom themselves to a sterile nomadic
existence, in which no organic fibers of connection and fertility can grow.
That is why, according to Rashi (12:1), the blessings that follow  
immediately on the call of lekh lekha are so necessary and so paradoxical. The

Travails of Faith
11
divine command thrusts Abram and Sarai into the eye of the storm, takes
the problem of akarut (barrenness) and has them act out all the meanings
of deracination, of disconnection from a succession of pasts.
An act of radical discontinuity is, it seems, depicted in the Torah as the
essential basis for all continuity: for that act of birth that will engender
the body and the soul of a new kind of nation. At the very beginning of
human life on earth, after God had created Eve —had made Adam
unconscious, removed a rib, and closed the flesh—the narrative voice had
proclaimed: "Hence a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his
wife, so that they become one flesh" (2:24). The Targum translates,
"Therefore shall a man leave his parents'bedroom": there is a profound and
often wrenching act of relinquishing to be undertaken, before new
unions can be established. The sterility of the child's involvement in the
"family romance" has to be left behind, in order that the self may find the
Other and, according to Rashi, in order that the new being, the vlad, may
be born. The Oedipal problem indicated by the Targum here is the basis
for a cultural and probably counterinstinctual directive by God.9
Abram's journey "from your father's house" can perhaps be seen as a
realization on a much more complex plane of this original and universal
demand. He detaches himself from a spurious or at least outgrown place
within an organism. He and Sarai are akarim, they recognize the sterility
of the place that nurtured them. In the full tension of that paradox, they
exile themselves to place after place and encounter new possibilities of
being.
Their akarut, in its double sense of infertility and rootlessness, is
placed in a context of ultimate blessing. ("And I shall make you into a
great nation and I shall bless you and make your name great, and you will
be a source of blessing" [12:2].) However, the midrash allows us no facile
resolution of the tension of their lives: " 'He makes the akara, the woman
who is the essence of the house [lit., the barren woman] to sit as the happy
mother of children' [Psalms 113:9]: this refers to Sarai, as it is said, 'And
Sarai was akara—barren.'"10 Sarai is described as both the barren one
and the joyous mother; these are not simply successive stages of a life, but
both remain necessary functions of her identity. Her later happiness
never obviates the twin image of alienation: the pun that the midrash sets
in focus insists on alienation-sterility as the very condition of Sarai's
significant maternity.

78
LEKH LEKHA
The essential drama of Abram and Sarai is always to be expressed in
paradoxical terms: Sarai is always both akara and "mother of children."
Or, as the midrash puts it, "7 will make of you a great nation9 [12:2]:
coinage was issued with his image on it. What image was engraved on the
coinage? An old man and woman on one face, a young man and girl on the
other."11
Abram and Sarai acquire "currency" in the world, their image  
acquires a mythic potency, just because it is two-faced: they are forever old
and young, barren and fruitful.12 Through them, a dialectical vision
seizes the imagination of human beings.
The imperative of transformation
The imperative of transformation is the driving force of Lekh Lekha. To
leave one's place is ultimately to seek to become other. Makom, the word
that becomes a leitmotif in midrashic meditations on Abraham's life,
indicates not only physical space, but existential condition. Makom is the
horizon of one's kiyyum, one's existence: the two words are clearly
related. When Rashi (15:5) sees in Abraham's change of name yet  
another facet of his change of "place," he includes both imperatives under
the rubric of a desired self-realization: "Abram has no son, but Abraham
has a son. Similarly, Sarai shall not give birth, but Sarah shall give birth. I
call you by a different name and your destiny shall change." The demand
on Abraham and Sarah is to leave one existential environment, one set of
paradigms, to emerge ("He took him outside" [15:5]) from their  
enclosure in the present (deathly sterile when outgrown) into a new condition,
in which a fertile self-realization becomes possible.
The promise/demand of God is "I will make of you a great nation,"
which the Tanhuma translates, "I shall create you anew."13 In this
reading, the call of lekh lekha is an urging to self-transformation: at base,
that is the meaning of a change of name, or a change of place.
Rambam speaks of teshuva, the penitential process, as involving the
same enactment of transformation: "The penitent should . . . change his
name, as if to say, I am another, I am not the same person who did those
things."14 To become other is to cut oneself off from the existential
conditions of previous nurturings.
Saul, for example, is to be transformed in a prophetic trance: "You will
become another man" (1 Samuel 10:6-11). The response of his social

Travails of Faith
79
world ("All who knew him previously") is a blank skepticism: "What's
happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul too among the prophets?" The
abrupt discontinuity in SauPs identity rings false to those who have
known him organically over time, going back to his origin as "son of
Kish." Significantly, "another person there," an inhabitant of Saul's new
world, responds to the skeptics: "And who are their fathers?" (10:12) —
"What has the past, its social-psychological structures, to do with the
inspiration of prophecy?" "Is Saul too among the prophets?" then
becomes an aphorism. Saul's case crystallizes the radical but not  
uncommon phenomenon of conversion. In this instance, the conversion is
charismatic: a turn of Saul's shoulder and God gives him another heart.
Perhaps that is why he finds it so difficult to live his new condition
authentically. That way madness lies.
The model of transformation presented by Abraham is more complex
and ambiguous. The Talmud15 speaks of a number of possibilities for
transforming the perceptions of a life. The givens and predictabilities of a
particular destiny may be subverted by acts of passionate will—by, for
instance, a change of name—on some views, by a change of place (makom).
For this strategy in "shredding a predetermined destiny," Abraham's
odyssey is the paradigm: "Go forth from your land. ... I will make of
you a great nation." The "shredding of destiny" — there is kri'ah, a
tearing apart of a gestalt apparently cut-and-dried. (Gezar din is literally
the "cutting edge of judgment," the irrevocable sentence of fate.) It is
possible, the Sages insist—and Abraham is the first to live this  
possibility— to move to a new place, to deconstruct all the structures of the old
place of being, and in a radical act of kri'ah, of akirah,16 to create entirely
new paradigms of reality.
"I shall create you anew" —the call of God is the quasi-autonomous
urge of man to create himself anew: "God took on the guise of a man who
urges [dohek—presses, squeezes, creates a sense of pressure or need] his
friend, 'Go from your land.' "17 The midrash, using the figure of God-as-
friend, reduces the transcendent force of the command-from-beyond:
kkh lekha becomes a divine-human drive, mysteriously originating within
Abram himself, for the sake of his own enlargement and self-realization.18
A voice urging discontinuity seduces him: only through a destabilizing
process can Abraham move from being Abram {av ram), the father of
Aram ("which was his place, mekomo" says Rashi [17:5] — suggesting the
mastery over a known modality of existence, a sterile fatherhood) to

80
LEKH LEKHA
being Abraham (av hamon goyim), the father of many nations — master of
multiple, successive places, who can then engender his true being
("Abraham has a son").
mbams view: Abraham as intellectual innovator
But how is such transformation achieved? In the Torah text, the call and
response are instantaneous: culture and sense of self are jettisoned in an
act without past or future.19 It is relevant here to consider William
James's discussion of instantaneous conversions, in Varieties of Religious
Experience. What lies behind such experiences, in James's analysis, is a
long incubation period, in which subconscious elements prepare  
themselves for a flowering, which is as much of a process as an event. "To say
that a man is 'converted' means, in these terms, that religious ideas,
previously peripheral in his consciousness, now take a central place, and
that religious aims form the habitual centre of his energy."20 The  
explosive emergence into daylight of hot and live ideas has had to bide its time,
while a hidden process of growth takes place.
The complexity of Abraham's incubation emerges from Rambam's
classic account of the spiritual and intellectual prehistory of Lekh Lekha:
When this giant was weaned, he began to roam around in his mind, while
he was still small, and began to think by day and by night, and he would
wonder, "How is it possible that this sphere moves constantly without
there being a mover, or one to turn it, for it is impossible that it turns
itself?" And he had no teacher or source of knowledge but he was sunk
among senseless idol worshippers in Ur of the Chaldeans; his parents
and the whole people worshipped idols and he worshipped with them.
But his mind roamed in search of understanding till he achieved the true
way and understood out of his own natural intelligence. He knew that
there is one God who moves the spheres, who created everything, and
there is none beside Him. He knew that the whole world was in error
and that the cause of their error was that they worshipped idols and
images, so that they had lost the truth. Abraham was forty years old
when he recognized his Creator. As soon as he achieved this  
knowledge, he entered into dialogue with the people of Ur of the Chaldeans
and contended with them about the truth of their beliefs, and he broke
the idols, and began to tell the people that it is not right to worship
anyone but the God of the world, and it is right to worship Him and
bring sacrifices to Him, so that all future generations will recognize
l\a

Travails of Faith
81
Him; that it is right to smash all the images so as to remove error from
the people. . . . When his arguments prevailed over them, the king
sought to kill him and a miracle happened for him, and he left Haran.
Then he began to stand and to cry out aloud to the whole world and to
tell them that the whole world has one God, whom alone it is right to
worship. He would cry out while traveling, and gather people around
him from city to city and from kingdom to kingdom till he reached the
land of Canaan, and there too he cried out, as it is said, "And he cried
out in the name of the Lord, God of the world." And when people
gathered round him and asked him the meaning of his words, he would
tell each one individually according to his capacity, till he brought him
back to the true way. Thousands and myriads gathered round him and
become part of his household, and he implanted in their hearts this
great principle and wrote books and taught it to Isaac, his son.21
On this reading, Abraham undergoes an autodidactic process, from
the age of three (he begins "small," though he is called a giant from the
outset) to the age of forty. It is a process of cognitive questioning that
leads him logically to the First Cause ("How is it possible? ... It is
impossible"). This inner process alienates him, teacherless and  
fatherless, from his entire world. Externally, however, he remains integrated
into his society, until the process is completed.
Then begins, literally, his iconoclastic phase, which in Rambam's
account is primarily a philosophical contesting of ideas, in which Abraham
defeats his opponents. As part of his development, he becomes a  
peripatetic teacher of monotheism, arriving finally (and without mention of the
originating lekh kkba moment) at Canaan. In Rambam's account,
Abraham's life is essentially the continuous growth of a thinker, teacher,
and writer. His early development is characterized by a striking and
repeated expression: — "he began to wander in his mind [le-shotet be-
da'ato]." This suggests a freedom from the cognitive norms of his society, a
kind of inner vagabondry, even while he maintains an outward conformism.
Thomas Kuhn, in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, writes of the
process by which scientists come to reject old paradigms — the activity of
puzzle solving within the parameters of "normal science" —and to see
reality in terms of new structures: "discovering a new sort of  
phenomenon is necessarily a complex event, one which involves recognizing both
that something is and what it is."22 Characteristics of such discoveries
include "the previous awareness of anomaly, the gradual and  
simultaneous emergence of both observational and conceptual recognition,

82
LEKH LEKHA
and the consequent change of paradigm categories and procedures often
accompanied by resistance. There is even evidence that these same
characteristics are built into the nature of the perceptual process itself."23
Kuhn describes a psychological experiment, in which subjects are
asked to identify anomalies in playing cards shown in brief exposure.
"The anomalous cards were almost always identified, without apparent
hesitation or puzzlement, as normal."24 Only on increase of exposure did
hesitation and confusion ensue, and for most subjects—"sometimes quite
suddenly" — correct identification of anomalous cards. The experiment
provides Kuhn with a "wonderfully simple and cogent schema for the
process of scientific discovery. In science, as in the playing card  
experiment, novelty emerges only with difficulty, manifested by resistance,
against a background provided by expectation."25
Normal science tends to suppress novelties but paradoxically is also
effective in causing them to arise. This is because the scientist's vision
becomes immensely restricted by increasing professionalization but at
the same time achieves a detail and precision that allows him, knowing
with precision what he should expect, to recognize that something has
gone wrong. "Anomaly appears only against the background provided by
the paradigm."26
Seen against these observations, Rambam's account of Abraham's
complex and gradual movement toward a revolutionary paradigm  
(philosophical rather than physical)27 yields its ambiguous force. On the one
hand, "he began to roam in his mind": a perceptual process in which, just
because one has mastered the current models of vision and expectation
one becomes increasingly aware (an "uncomfortable" experience)28 of
anomalies that are resolved more or less suddenly in the new paradigm.
(Perhaps this professionalized mastery is indicated in Rashi's note on
Abram's name: "father [av] of Aram, which was his place" (17:5), where he
had expertise and full familiarity.) On the other hand, there is the gestalt
switch, the change of paradigm that "must occur all at once or not at
all"29 —he "recognized his Creator."
On this view, scientific development is "a succession of tradition-
bound periods punctuated by noncumulative breaks." To describe
Abraham's intellectual searchings as a process of "roaming in his mind"
is to suggest a freedom to perceive anomalies, without recourse to
preconceived paradigms. There is an open-ended quality to the  
expression, a free-wheeling motion set in paradoxical relation with Abraham's

Travails of Faith
83
conformist behavior as a "normal" scientist ("and he worshiped with
them")—until the breakthrough is achieved, until he sees both that He is
and what He is ("He knew that there is one God—and that He moves the
spheres").
Nlidrash Ha-Gadol: The passionate search
If we compare Rambam's account with that in Midrash Ha-Gadol,  
however, we find a significantly different emphasis, indeed a different order of
development:
"You love righteousness and hate wickedness; righdy has God, your
God, chosen to anoint you with oil of gladness over all your peers"
[Psalms 45:8]. This was said with reference to Abraham, who loved
God and approached close beneath the wings of His presence, and
hated the idolatry of his father's house. For his father's family were idol
worshippers, they manufactured images and gave them to Abraham to
sell in the market. And when someone would come to buy an image
from him, what would he do? He would take a hammer and batter the
head of each idol, saying, "Is it this one you want? Or this one?" And
when the buyer saw this, he would give up his intention and go away
And Abraham would roam in his mind, thinking, "How long shall we
bow down to the work of our own hands? It is not right to worship and
bow down to anything but the earth, which brings forth fruit and
sustains us." But when he saw that the earth needs rain, and that
without the sky opening and sending down rain, the earth would grow
nothing at all, then he thought again: "It is not right to bow down to
anything but the sky." He looked again and saw the sun which gives
light to the world, and brings forth the plants, and thought, "It is not
right to bow down to anything but the sun." But when he saw the sun
setting, he thought, "That is no god." He looked again at the moon
and the stars that give light at night, and thought, "To these it is right
to bow down." But when the dawn broke, they were all effaced, and he
thought, "These are no gods." He was in distress at the thought: "If
these phenomena have no mover, why does one set and the other rise?"
To what can this be compared? To a traveler who saw a tremendous
large castle, and wanted to enter it. He examined it from all sides but
could find no entry. He called out a few times but there was no
response. Then he lifted up his eyes and saw red woolen cloths spread
out on the roof. After that, he saw white flaxen cloths. The traveler
thought, "Surely a man lives in that casde—for otherwise how would

84
LEKH LEKHA
the cloths appear and disappear?" When the master of the castle saw
that he was in distress over this, he asked, "Why are you in distress? I
am the master of the castle." Similarly, when Abraham saw the  
appearance and disappearance of phenomena in nature, he thought, "Unless
there were someone in charge, this would not happen. It is not right to
bow down to these, but to the One in charge." And he wandered in his
mind, trying to find the truth of the matter. When God saw him in
distress, He said to him, "You love righteousness" — to justify the
world.30
Here, the inner process of search ("roaming in his mind"), is  
accompanied by physical expressions of rejection, anger, a kind of impatience
approaching contempt for the unenlightened responses of his world and
indeed of himself — "How long shall we bow down . . . ?" The anger of
his iconoclasm is literally enacted here in the smashing of idols; while in
Rambam's account, Abraham engages in philosophical encounters: "he
entered into dialogue with the people of Ur of the Chaldeans and
contended with them. . . ." The actual smashing of the idols is there
merely a logical outcome of his arguments: "he began to tell them that it
is not right to serve any but the God of the world."
In Midrash Ha-Gadol, Abraham acts with an immediacy and passion
that Rambam modulates into a philosophical key. Even the idolatrous
belief Rambam explains (in a famous passage just preceding the one we
have quoted) as a philosophical error, a result of quite plausible stages of
response to the world. In the midrash, the existential confrontation with
each stage of hope and faith reduced to absurdity is lived through
primarily by Abraham himself; it is a shared human dilemma that he
endures. "When he saw ... he looked again": repeatedly he suffers
disillusion as his passion for worship is denied ("It is not right. . . ."). He
lives the vicissitudes of his temporality as though he were primal man first
set in the world of nature. The setting of the sun is the fading of a world of
hopes and beliefs. As the cyclical dimension of time dawns on him, he
comes to an utter recognition of "le neant" — "When they were all
effaced, he thought, 'These are no gods.'" His reaction is emotional and
personal —"he was in distress." His search issues from imperative need,
like the need of the traveler to enter the castle, to find an opening,
ultimately to receive an answering cry to his cry.
Faced with the closed facade of the castle, he observes the changing
phenomena on the battlements and concludes that there must be a Being

Travails of Faith
85
who contains and harmonizes contraries within Himself. This faith is
characterized by the pain and constriction of not knowing. Only after he
has reached the impasse of overwhelming desire confronting total opacity
("When He saw that he was in distress"), does the Master of the Castle
speak to him. In the mashal (parable), what He says is simply that He is; in
the nimshal (the decoding of the parable), what God says is a return to the
opening prooftext, now demonstrably descriptive of Abraham.
The whole thrust of the midrash, indeed, is a phenomenological
account of the passion for tzedek, for righteousness: for a vision of the
natural human world that is spiritually coherent. Abraham here becomes
archetypal man in quest of meaning, the experience of meaning. What he
wants is to enter into the castle, not merely to observe its changing colors.
The rovings of his mind are passionate and needy; his intent finally ("to
find the truth of the matter") is to find a stable core to his own existence
(the truth is figured as a basis, a standing ground), and the pain of his quest
is essential to the revelation he is granted. The recognition of God is not a
final conclusion reached after a long private philosophical odyssey, but—
as the verse about the love of righteousness indicates—an unlocated
passion which inspires him with an energy for hope and disillusion that
takes him through the phases of his experience.
In the midrash, then, the evocative expression, identical with Ram-
bam's — "the roaming of his mind" —is used to very different effect.
Here, Abraham bears the whole world with him in his personal anguished
search. Le-shotet—To roam, implies full exposure to the hazards of
experience. The resonance of sboteb —"fool" — lingers on: the radical
"folly" of those who abandon safe structures and fare forth on unmapped
roads.31 In terms of the "normal science" of his world, his is a non-
paradigm problem and is therefore viewed as a "distraction"32  
—irrelevant, even crazed. He is armed with no alternative paradigm but only
with a pressing sense of anomaly that may find no resolution at all. His
question can never be solved within the puzzle-framework of "normal
science"; the question he asks is a different, a larger one; and in seeking to
"enter into" the castle, he intuits an experience that is latent, not  
manifest in the material world.
Here, we approach the essence of the lekh lekha experience. InMidrash
Ha-Gadol, after the quoted passage, the bold statement ensues: "The first
trial was tiltul, which is the hardest of all." Tiltul is a kind of harassed,
distracted, even confused movement. Is Abraham's journey indeed a

86
LEKH LEKHA
movement oi distraction, in the full irony of its two senses: a drawing away,
a truancy from the fruitful pursuits of life, and, ultimately, a madness?
Tiltul is the word that is most vividly descriptive of exile;33 to be in exile is
to be "off the point," it is to be reduced to a handled passivity in which
drives and compulsions dominate freely regulated motion. Like a ball,
says the midrash, which is caught in the air, and can never touch ground.
Or like a dove that never rests; folds one wing at a time and flies on,
obedient to some instinct of the species.
Tiltul is the hardest experience of all, and it is this that is the measure of
Abraham's passion:" 'Your ointments yield a sweet fragrance, Your name
is like finest oil' [Song of Songs 1:3]. What did Abraham resemble? A
flask of myrrh, surrounded by wadding placed in a corner, so that its
fragrance could not escape. But when it was carried from place to place
[tiltul], its fragrance wafted out."34 The transformation of Abraham's
being, which is signified in the change of his name (the "extension" of his
name) can be achieved only through a readiness to submit himself to the
"distractions" of placelessness. The perfume is released and diffused in
the transforming discontinuities of the lekh lekba travail.
lJereshit Rabbah: The castle afire
Another version of the casde midrash is found in Bereshit Rabbah; the
differences are significant:
"The Lord said to Abram, Go forth from your land." "Take heed, lass,
and note, incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house"
[Psalms 45:11]. This is like a man who was traveling from place to
place, when he saw a casde on fire. He thought, "Can you say that this
casde is without a master?" Then, the master of the casde looked out at
him, and said, "I am master of the casde." In the same way, since
Abraham was constandy wondering, "Can you say that this world is
without a Master?" God looked out at him and said, "I am Master of
the world." "And let the king be aroused by your beauty; since He is
your Lord" [Psalms 45:12]: And let the King be aroused by your
beauty, that is, to show your beauty to the world. "And you shall bow
down to Him."3S
Here, the traveler moves from "place to place"; he sees a casde on fire,
and he articulates in negative form a hypothesis about the meaning of the
fire: "Would you say that this casde is without a master?" An uncon-

Travails of Faith
87
trolled conflagration suggests that there is no one to care for the castle, to
extinguish the flames. In the negative form, the question expresses  
expectation disappointed. In Bergson's terms, Abraham indulges in the  
"peculiar possibility,, that language affords: the confrontation with the "Idea of
Nothing" that does not exist in nature. Only verbally can man formulate
absence, and only man can move "from place to place"; can yield his firm
footing in one existential frame for vertiginous space between places of
kiyyum (clearly located being).
It is in response to this form of the question that the Master looks out
at him—a revelation that reinforces the enigma. This hatzatza, the glance
of the Master, is an intimation, a glimmer produced by the courage of the
question. Ultimately, this intimation reveals the traveler to himself: it is a
moment of self-awareness, of the extent of his protest and his terror/
wonder at the Masterless world. In this flash of knowledge, the question
becomes the answer; through the contingency of frustration, the traveler
finds an avenue to consciousness.
i^iave and madness
This is, in fact, the reading of the midrash offered by the hasidic writer,
Mei Ha-shiloah(the Ishbitzer). The emphasis here is on Abraham's quest
for hi?nself for the "root of his own life." This is the literal rendition of
Lekh lekha—"Go to yourself'9; only in the movement inwards is the God-
joy that is true life to be found. Mei Ha-shiloah also renders literally the
phrase in the midrash, "The Master of the castle looked out at him" — the
preposition al suggesting that Abraham is the focus of the Master's gaze.
Abraham's attention, in the moment of anger and despair at the absurdity
of a Masterless world, is drawn to himself. In a Kantian movement of self-
awareness, he turns inward, finds a point of contact with a power not
himself in his moral consciousness, in the "search for righteousness
rather than ... for truth"36 —"You love righteousness. . . ." This is a
theology that, in Peter Berger's terms,37 begins with anthropology; the
sense of outraged questioning is itself the first confrontation with God.
SefatEmet, in commentaries on this midrash,38 speaks of this essential
capacity to detach oneself from the psychological conditions of one's
being, one's standing place in the world ("Go forth from your land"). To
move onwards to new "places" is the creative gift of the tzaddik, which is
called "greatness." "I shall make you into a great nation" is the promise,

88
LEKH LEKHA
then, of the continuing expansion of possibilities and of visions. The great
enemy, in this perspective, is torpor, habituation. Abraham becomes
emblematic of man discovering his own life's energies, as he confronts the
hiddenness of God. "Where you are, there arises a place" (Rilke). Or, in
the words of the Sefat Emet, "Go to the Land that I shall show you —
where I shall make you visible, where your potential being will be realized
in multiform and unpredictable ways."
From this last version of the midrash, then, there emerges a sense of
the journey itself, the travail, as essential to the birth and growth of self.
Tiltul, the not always graceful lurching of uncertainty, releases the  
perfume; it also teeters on the verge of madness —"Look at that old man
traveling about the country like a madman!" And ultimately, that is the
finest compliment that is paid to Abraham. Rambam describes Abraham
as the epitome of the "love of God," an ideal but rare condition, testified
to by God Himself, who speaks of "Abraham, My lover" (Isaiah 41:8).39
What is this condition of right love? It is, that one should love God with
an excessive, powerful love, till one's soul is totally involved in love of
God, and one is constandy obsessed [shogeh] by it, as though ill with
love sickness, when there is no place in one's mind free of the love of
that woman with whom one is obsessed —neither when one sits nor
stands, eats nor drinks. More than this, should be the love of God in the
heart of those who love Him and are obsessed by Him. This is the
meaning of the command, "You shall love your God with all your heart
and with all your soul. . . ." And also of King Solomon's allegory, "for I
am love-sick" [Song of Songs 2:5]: indeed, the whole of Song of Songs
is an allegory for this.40
To love is total obsession: the word used is shogeh, which is clearly
related to shaga, madness. Rambam describes a kind of pathology of
passionate love, human as image for the divine. The characteristic of this
"love sickness" is that it leaves no space—it is a constant accompaniment to
all the normal activities of life. It represents, then, a paradoxical union of
fixity and dispersion. It is the capacity to live on two planes at once; to
seem to be in possession of oneself, so that one acts within the normal
limits of culture and society, and yet to know inwardly that one is utterly
lost in a not-here distraction of love.
The most interesting aspect of the word shogeh is perhaps the fact that
though it is used to express focused fascination,41 the root meaning is
almost the opposite: to be unfocused, to reel away from, to be off target

Travails of Faith
89
(related to sbogeg, unwilled action). (Rashi acknowledges the paradox:42
"Beware the distracting effects of passion, even for your own wife!") To be
shogeb, or meshugga, is at root to be absent. In the ideal model of love of
God offered by Rambam, a passionate absence from the world is  
paradoxically set at the heart of behavioral normalcy.
This model of Abraham's achievement represents a fragile  
equilibrium; on the one side, worldliness, on the other, madness. It is the
awareness of this tension that characterizes Abraham's "reeling" motion.
Current explanations of the world no longer work for him;43 the shogeh-
alienation caused by "love of righteousness" contains within it (in the
English word, as well as in the Hebrew—alienation was once one of the
clinical terms for madness) both hazard and the birth of a "terrible
beauty."44
L^ave and mystery
Abraham's active spiritual life begins and ends, we noticed, in  
indeterminacy. The lekh lekha of the first trial is echoed by the kkh lekha of the
last, the Akedah. In both, the nub of his experience (the "trial within the
trial") is indeterminacy. ("Go ... to the land that I shall show you"
[12:1]; "Sacrifice him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I
shall tell you" [22:2].) No destination is specified. In the Akedah  
narrative, Isaac's name, too, is not at once revealed ("Take your son, your
favored one, whom you love, Isaac" [22:2]). Rashi's comment on all three
points of mystification is enigmatic: "'that I shall show you': He did not
reveal to him the land right away, so as to endear it to him, and to give him
reward for each word spoken" (12:2).
Rashi affirms a relation between mystery and love. He adds that there
is a reward for each word spoken: where there is total revelation, there is
no room for language; where meaning is uncertain, words,  
approximations of interpretation and communication, proliferate.45 And this state,
it seems, offers an opportunity to Abraham—the reward that is called
hiba, love ("so as to endear it to him"). Maharal, in his supercommentary
on Rashi, suggests that in the veiling of the truth, there is distress for a
human being, who wants to know clearly what is God's will. This distress
generates an intense receptivity to every shred of communication that
comes from God. When one strains for intimations of relationship, one
demonstrates biba.

90
LEKH LEKHA
When, however, we compare Rashi's comments on the other two
passages he includes here to illustrate his point, we find that they are not
identical:
"your son": why did He not reveal the son's name initially? So as not to
confuse him abruptly, with the result of sending him out of his mind
and driving him mad. Also, so as to endear the command to him and to
give him reward for each word spoken. (22:2)
"on one of the mountains": God keeps the righteous wondering (mat-
heh), and only afterwards reveals meaning explicitly to them—and all
this in order to increase their reward. (22:2)
Clearly, Rashi wants us to understand these three phrases as  
illustrations of a single motif. In the second example, however, he adds as a
reason for delayed clarification the desire to preserve Abraham's sanity,
which might crack under too sudden and too brutal a statement. The
danger ofterufba-da'at, literally, the rending of the mind, an experience
of sharp dislocation and discontinuity, is thus woven into the text about
love and reward. Are they quite separate reasons for delaying  
clarification, or has this delay, which preserves the integrity of the psyche, got
something to do with love and the rewards of language? In the third
example, Rashi significantly generalizes his point, to make a statement
that transcends the particular narrative; it is characteristic of God's
relation with the righteous that He allows them time for questioning and
wonder, and only reveals the determined reality ahar kakh—afterwards,
ultimately.
The expression Rashi quotes from Bereshit Rabbah is highly evocative:
mat-heh means to wonder, gaze, be astonished, be plunged into a sense of
the unfathomable (tehom is the unfathomable deep, which contains all
and expresses nothing: out of it emerges heaven and earth). It can mean
regret, an openness to conflicting responses. The capacity to move to
new paradigms of perception is the creative possibility in human life and,
to the anthropomorphic imagination, it is the basis of the concept of
divine forgiveness. It is called tebiya, the waste space between clarities.46
In another version of Rashi's text, the word used is mash-heb — delay, a
time that stands still, as it were, when the flow is retarded and a freedom is
granted for contemplation.47 God gives the righteous time-out-of-time,
like a still in a film, in which a different sense of being-with and being-in
the crisis develops. This is the irreducible word, colorless, transparent,

Travails of Faith
91
for being; simple survival, the gift, the interval between the named, the
placed—that exile-in-time in which selves are born.48 In this condition of
akarut, where nothing is assumed, between worlds of naming, a radical
astonishment abides. As with Rashi's alternative term mat-heh, God's
grace to the righteous is the "wild surmise,, of discovery.49 In this
interval, each dibbur, each speech act, is crafted by man's articulation of
God's voice out of the silence. An intense listening—and "afterwards,"
a bar kakh — revelation.
This kind of communication between God and the human being has
as its purpose hiba. Its disadvantages may be obvious —indeterminacy,
loneliness, the kind of sterility and palpable absence that akarut in its
ambiguity poignantly suggests. But the protraction of suspense in time
and space is presented as a key to the experience of "love of the  
commandment."50 This quality of love, intimate, familiar, personal, is the strange
fruit of a dislocation that threatens Abraham's very sanity. At the core,
this is the paradox of Abraham's life from alpha to omega. The crisis of
lekh lekha, of the Akedah, is a demand for deracination. The words akira
(barrenness, uprootedness) and keri'a (torn-ness, rupture) describe a
condition of exile that threatens the very possibility of language.  
(Consider, for instance, Rashi's comment on God's promise of blessing and
fruitfulness: this is necessary precisely because exile by its nature erodes
the sense of self and the connections between self and world.51
The expression Rashi uses to describe the menace of groundlessness —
tazuah da'ato alav, "sending him out of his mind and driving him mad"
(22:2) —conveys an overbearing elation (literally, being borne out of all
structures and limits). That way madness lies, consciousness torn adrift of
all the fibers of connection. There is a seductive lure in the call of lekh
lekha: to cut free of all that one was is to rend the very fabric of
consciousness.52
And yet terefnatan li-y'reiav (Psalms 111:5): the gift of rending, teruf,
of discontinuity, madness, God gives to those who fear Him. This is the
hasidic (mis)reading of the text, which translates more literally, "God
gives food, daily sustenance [lit., the torn-off portions of meat] to those
who fear Him." What the hasidic reading emphasizes is that the man
who stands in a certain relation with God (called yirah, fear, a condition of
balance, limitation) acquires the capacity to find his own sustenance, his
inner springs of being, in a modality that isolates him in passionate

92
LEKH LEKHA
individuality. But how live a teruf, a torn-ness, that is a gift and not a
destruction?53
The question relates to the innermost quality of Abraham's  
experience — the "trial in the midst of the trial." What is given is the unmapped
space and time, that we call freedom, in which to nurture love. Hiba is the
organic relation that is developed in spite of, or perhaps only because of
the vicissitudes and travails of a world in which God does not reveal His
meanings. "We interpret always as transients," writes Frank Kermode in
a study of hermeneutics (Hermes, he points out, was the god of  
travelers).5\* The opportunity that is offered-by dislocation is of shebiya and
tehiya, of infinite possibilities open to human articulation. In mystery,
therefore, the command of God becomes integrated over time into man's
fullest creative life.
The peculiar quality of love suggested by hiba can be seen, for example,
in the statement in B. Berakhot 63b: "The Torah is as beloved (havivah)
each day to those who learn it as it was on the day it was first given." How
do we know this? asks the Talmud. "Because a person reads the Shema
prayer morning and evening, but if he forgot one evening—it is as though
he had never read the Shema at all!" In a sense, one missed connection in
the web oihiba spun from Sinai to "this very day"55 unravels the whole
web. For the very nature oihiba is the continuous organic thickening of
relationship. The interplay of consciousness with the mitzvah is what
creates hiba; the uninterrupted murmur of "those who learn" Torah is
the cumulative voice of Sinai.56
The redemptive possibility of teruf lies in the intensity of loss it
registers. The word implies a wrenching knowledge of alienation from
oneself. In a passage in Midrash Tanhuma,57 Pharaoh's dreams are
compared with Nebuchadnezzar's: — Va-tipa'em ruho ("his spirit was  
agitated") (Genesis 41:8) is compared with va-titpa'em ruho (Daniel 2:1) —
the more intense reflexive form: "Pharaoh, who knew the dream, but not
its interpretation, suffered one teruf, one anxiety attack.  
Nebuchadnezzar, who had forgotten both the dream and its interpretation, suffered
a double teruf— therefore it is written, va-titpa'em"
To be "torn" is to know oneself bereft; on another level, to know
oneself diminished. In mourning, one tears one's clothes; but there are
certain losses — of parents, of a teacher, of a burnt Scroll of the Law—that
represent kera'in sheheinan mitahin — gashes that can never be sewn  
together: these are irreparable losses, that affect the survivor in his very

Travails of Faith
93
essence. In a poignant narrative in B. Berakhot 42b, Rav's students tear
their clothes on his death. A problem immediately arises about the right
course of action in a halakhic question (grace after meals). Rav Ida
reverses the tear he has already made, in order to tear again: "Rav has left
us, and we did not learn how to say the grace after meals from him!" In
halakha, keri'a, the tearing of clothes, expresses the existential awareness
of distance, of not knowing. A source of light is withdrawn: with each
throb of that realization comes the increasing appreciation of torn-ness.
A urmoil and integration
At the core of Abraham's experience is the complex ofakarut, keri'a, tiltul,
and teruf But in the sbehiya, the tehiya that God gives him, he plumbs
these experiences to their depths. In the space and time that are his
freedom, he contemplates the possible meanings of mystery.
This is the tension at the heart of Abraham's faith, as the midrash
portrays him. On the one hand, he is classically praised as one of the
fathers of the nation, who had no questioning thoughts about God's
ways.58 The famine that afflicts him immediately when he arrives in
Canaan is explained as a test of his unquestioning faith in God's promises:
"to test him whether he would have qualms [birhurim] about God's
promises" (Rashi, 12:10). But, on the other hand, active hirhurim, a term
that expresses the imaginative, passionate level of  
consciousness—perhaps the area of the id—is just what Abraham is credited with:
"And it was after these things" [15:1]: after the hirhurim, the troubled
thoughts that ensued. Who was troubled? Abraham questioned God,
"Master of the universe, You made a covenant with Noah that You
would never destroy his children. Then I came along and pleased You
better, so that my relation with You overrode his. Perhaps someone else
will come along and please You better than me, so that his relation with
You overrides mine?" [The reference is to the fact that Abraham had
been allowed to kill with impunity descendants of Noah; his fear is that
his own descendants may find themselves expendable, if a further
process of selection takes place.] God replied, "Among Noah's  
children there are no righteous people who intercede for others, but
among yours there will be."59
Abraham brings many responses to bear on his victory over the four
Canaanite kings (chap. 14). His vision transcends the immediate grati-

94
LEKH LEKHA
fication of triumph: there are larger questions to trouble him about God's
dealings with man. His questionings are not faulted; on the contrary, they
lead to an unfolding of meaning in God's response.
Similarly, after the anguish of the Akedah is resolved, there is another
"after these things" (22:20), and again the midrash speaks of questioning
responses:60
"And it was after these things" [22:20]: after the hirhurim, the troubled
thoughts that ensued. Who was troubled? Abraham questioned God,
"If Isaac had died on Mount Moriah, would that not have meant that he
died childless? Now that a miracle has been done for him, what shall I
do? I shall marry him to one of the daughters of Aner, Eshkol and
Mamrei, who are righteous—what do I care for aristocratic  
connections?" God answered him, "There is no need for you to do that. Isaac's
mate is already born—'Milcah too has given birth.'" [22:20]
Again, the hirhurim have to do with an unexpected range of responses
within Abraham's imagination, an openness to many possible  
implications in what has just happened to him. Abraham is concerned for
eternity, knows himself responsible for providing scaffolding for the
future. With that concern uppermost in his mind, he is willing to do what
previously had been unthinkable for him—to marry Isaac to a daughter of
Aner, Eshkol, and Mamrei. After he has explored the reaches of his
apprehensions and commitment, God reveals that He has, in fact, already
taken responsibility for the future.
The word hirhur in its doubled-root form suggests vagueness, the
inchoate dream state that precedes cognition.61 The hur root evokes the
state of herayon — gestation, conception, in its physiological and its  
intellectual sense. The hirhur is at the opposite pole from the act: a heated,
fluid state in which many things are implicit, as opposed to the  
crystallized realization. "Hirhurim of sin are worse than sin itself" — fantasy is
more powerful than reality, because it answers more adequately to the
infinite demands of the spirit. An anarchic range of consciousness is
attributed to Abraham in these classical midrashic sources, although in
others he is just as specifically credited with a pure and untraveled faith
(in the matter of the famine, and of the land promised but still laboriously
purchased as a burial plot).
"There is an angel appointed over herayon, over pregnancy."62 Each state

tion and implicit form. Abraham's birhurim are suffused with the  
characteristic hues of his concerns: they are unique to him. Conversely, certain sorts
of birhurim are not "for him," can never be his.63 But where he is observed in
the world of birbur, he expresses the central paradox of his destiny.  
Responsive to displacement, he probes his condition to its limits; for this purpose,
he is given time and space for "play," in Huizinga's sense.64
But even here, in the interstice "between place and place" (me-makom
le-makom), he is animated by the vital quest of his being—" 'You have
loved righteousness': he loved God and sought to come closer beneath
the wings of His presence."65 His knowledge of God is not the result of an
orderly process of inquiry (the Platonic notion of truth that is reflected in
Rambam's account: "at age three, he began to explore ... at forty, he
recognized his Creator"), but rather the informing passion of a life in
which all forms are to be deconstructed. When he is cut loose in the
world, "chaos is come again."66 In the world of words, of questions asked
and questions unasked, Abraham discovers his own being and the hiba
that is his personal nexus with God.
Midrash Tanhuma illuminates the paradox with a pun:
"We have a little sister, whose breasts are not yet formed" [Song of
Songs 8:8]. Of whom does the text speak? Of Abraham, when he was
thrown by Nimrod into the fiery furnace — he was still "little," for God
had not yet done miracles for him. Why is he called "sister"? Because
he sewed the whole world together in the presence of God! [This is a pun
on the words ahot (sister) and la-ahot (to sew); in fact, the sibling
concept is integrally related to the paradox of together/separate.] He
was like a person who tears apart and sews together—therefore he is called
"sister" [my italics].67
Abraham is called ahot, because he represents the desire to reintegrate
(ehad [one], ahot [sister], and la-ahot [to sew] are clearly connected) his
own world with God. Paradoxically, however, his radical activity is dual:
"tearing and sewing," rending and rendering one. As he comes to
understanding and resolution, he uncovers further mysteries, invitations
to love.68
Perhaps, the midrash even implies in this audacious phrase (rending
and rendering one) that the peculiar greatness of Abraham is his response
to the hiddenness of God. Despite his distress, he must even "seek for
ways of magnifying the breakdown."69 In this sense, he will "often seem

96
LEKH LEKHA
like a man searching at random." But in the current generated between
the two poles of "rending and rendering one," there is intensified life.
"I will make of you a great nation" (12:2) —the "small sister" has the
potential to grow into a "great nation." For to be great is Abraham's
destiny, in the sense of maturity and high evolution—"like a grown-up
son who knows how to search in his father's treasuries [his hidden
drawers]."70 The index to Abraham's maturity is the exquisite tension he
maintains between the hiddenness, the incommensurate Otherness of
God, and the daring activity of his own integrative mind.

The demand for sacrifice
Some time afterward, God put Abraham to the test. He said to him,
"Abraham," and he answered, "Here I am." And He said, "Take your
son, your favored one, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of
Moriah, and offer him there as burnt offering on one of the heights that
I will point out to you." (22:1-2)
Ahar ha-devarim hayeleh — "And it was after these things" (or, in the
JPS translation, "Some time afterward"): the subject of this chapter is to
be the culmination of Abraham's life. Here, God demands of Abraham
{pleads with him, in Rashi's reading of the word na that modulates God's
demand1) that he take his beloved son, Isaac (yebidkba, lit., your only one)
and offer him as a sacrifice. As a burnt offering, Isaac will—technically—
be consumed totally; emotionally, existentially, this will leave Abraham
with nothing to show for his life. "After these things" places the Akedah
test in the sequence of Abraham's life; it suggests, too, that what is at
stake is a judgment on Abraham's whole history.
The Talmud, however, understands the opening clause very specifically:
"After these things"-, after the words of Satan, as it is written, "The child
grew up and was weaned, and [Abraham] held a great feast" [21:8].
Satan said to God, "This old man—You granted him fruit of the womb
when he was a hundred years old. And yet of all the feasts that he made,
he did not have a single turde dove or a young bird to sacrifice to You!"
God answered him, "He has done nothing that was not for his son—
and if I were to say to him, 'Sacrifice your son to Me,' he would
immediately obey." Immediately after that, "God tested Abraham."2

VA-YERA
Rashi quotes the Talmud (with slight variations), and thus introduces the
figure of Satan, who is to be so central in midrashic literature on the
narrative. Who is Satan, and how does he function here? It seems that the
whole Akedah trial comes about at his instigation: his is the voice  
(demonic? rational?) that ultimately makes it necessary, in the rhetoric of the
midrash, for God to make His demand. ^Immediately^ — Go A tested
Abraham.)
Compare this version of the Midrash with the one in Bereshit Rabbah:
"After these things": after the troubled thoughts that ensued. Who was
troubled? Abraham was troubled; he thought, "I have rejoiced and I
have spread joy everywhere—and yet I have never set aside a bullock or
a ram for God." God replied, "In the end you will be told to sacrifice
your son and you will not refuse."
(Another view:) The ministering angels said, "This Abraham has
rejoiced and spread joy everywhere—and yet he has never set aside a
bullock or a ram for God." God replied, "In the end he will be told to
sacrifice his son and he will not refuse."
Abraham's inner qualms, on the one hand, and the ministering angels,
on the other, accuse Abraham of some defect that Satan summarizes
ironically as a kind of poverty: he did not have a single turtle dove.
Conspicuous consumption, without sacrifice. What is the relation  
between the concept of seyudahy the banquets that Abraham apparently
prepared so lavishly, and the missing sacrificial animal? Is it a kind of
hypocrisy that he is being accused of? After all, there are references to
altars earlier in Abraham's career.3 Does the accusing voice insinuate that
since Isaac was granted him, he has lived a life of self-indulgence and
virtually forgotten God?
In the rhetoric of the midrash in Sanhedrin, Satan dreams up the
Akedah; a terrible hypothesis is tested in reality. God is compelled by
Satan's logic to defend His beloved, loving Abraham.4 "Eelu—Ifl were
to say to him. . . ." What Abraham knows would be true of himself in an
unimaginable ordeal is subject to the attacks of Satan—to the point
where confrontation becomes unavoidable. After the crisis is over, God
says: "Now I know that you fear God" (22:12). Rashi's comment is:
" 'From now on, I have a reply for Satan and for other nations who are
puzzled by My special love for you. From now on, I can answer back [lit., I
have an opening of the mouth], since they see that you do fear God.' "5

Feasting and laughter
God Himself is silenced by Satan's insinuation. Only Abraham can argue
his own Satan, his troubled thoughts, to the ground, by the unanswerable
force of action. Then Abraham can return to his feasting. What are the
implications of the feasting? And what is the subversive force of Satan's
sneer?
From the source in Sanhedrin, it would seem that the reference is
primarily to the "great banquet" that Abraham made to celebrate Isaac's
weaning (21:8). This notion becomes somewhat problematic in view of
Satan's phrase, "of all the feasts that he made." This suggests that
feasting represents a certain dimension of Abraham's mode of relating to
his world; this idea we shall discuss later. What are we to understand
about this banquet? Why is specific mention made of it, and of its size?
Rashi's comment focuses attention on the guests at the "great feast":
" 'great' because the great personalities of that generation were present—
Shem, Ever, and Avimelekh." In this reading, the point of the banquet is
to communicate with the representatives of contemporary civilization: a
"banquet for the great" (as the version in Bereshit Rabbab has it) is an
event in which the feasting becomes an occasion for the meeting of
worlds. And who are the guests at the banquet? Notably, Avimelekh, king
of the Philistines. The irony of the situation is manifest in the midrashic
subtext. Avimelekh is, in the view of kitzanei ha-dor— the cynics of the
time —the obvious biological father of Isaac.6 Any sophisticated observer
can deduce the truth of a situation in which an elderly, sterile couple
produce a child shortly after the wife is kidnapped by a lustful king. Yet
Avimelekh is high on the guest list. Abraham's way with feasts apparently
has to do with feeding those whose thoughts and sensibilities are not only
different from his but even threaten him with ridicule.
The atmosphere of laughter that attends the birth of Isaac is  
essentially ambiguous: "Sarah said, God has brought me laughter; everyone
who hears will laugh with me" (21:6). Sarah internalizes the tension set
up by laughter as joy at enlarged possibilities, on the one hand, and the
laughter that (bitterly? cruelly?) denies any possibility but the quotidian
reality. To laugh is to confront the pressures of necessity on one's
individual destiny and one's infinite desires. To laugh is to counter
Spinoza's first great law of thought: non ridere, non lugere, neque detestari,
sed intellegere— to laugh, to suffer, to rejoice, to hate, and to weep are to

100
VA-YERA
affirm the reality of the self as not simply an undifferentiated part of the
world of objects ruled by necessity.7
The birth of Isaac (attended by multiple births and healings in the
world, according to Rashi) is an outrageous flouting of law and necessity,
of common wisdom and stoic, philosophical acceptance. The reaction,
the explosion of laughter, may run a long gamut (from mockery to joy, as
Ramban puts it),8 but the very fact of laughter places man firmly,  
absurdly, at the center of his world.
Abraham and Sarah know of this laughter: they invite it into their
home, as they feast with Avimelekh. Like the se 'udab, the food of the feast,
laughter is a mode of communion. Michel Tournier writes of the  
phenomenon of cryptophasia, the private language of twins, which thrives at
the expense of normal speech and of "social intelligence.'' In the twinless
world, the phenomenon is paralleled by that of laughter: "Because when
two individuals laugh together—and only then—they come near to the
mystery of cryptophasia. At such times they are using a pseudo-language,
laughter, based on a common ground . . . which, unintelligible in itself,
has as its function to narrow the distance between their respective
positions which divides them from that common base."9
In both pseudo-languages, "the words are incidental, silence is the
essence" (my emphasis). What is implicit in the dialogue is abnormally
large, "so that the explicit always remains below the minimum necessary
to make it decipherable by outside listeners.,, This is "a language without
diffuseness, radiating nothing, the concentration of everything that was
most private and secret in us."10
Abraham and Sarah, by inviting the laughter to their table, share in it
and modulate it. It is a fully human affirmation of affinity, a nonverbal
possibility somewhere "between the wordlessness of animals and the
silence of the gods."11 In the relationship with their peers, it enacts the
oral potential that Ramban writes of, in his comment on Sarah's solitary
laughter of denial:12 iliAnd Sarah laughed to herself [18:12]: For the
laughter of joy is from the mouth—'Our mouths shall be filled with
laughter' [Psalms 126:2] —but inward laughter can not be said to be
joyfal."
The mouth filled with real laughter—like the food of the feast, audible
and sensible to others —is an image representing the end of days, the
overcoming of separateness and closure. In this world, it remains a mere
possibility that constantly destroys itself.

Perhaps Ahasuerus's feast, which opens the book of Esther, can be
seen as a grotesque caricature, a surrealistic parody of the meaning of
feasts. It is conducted "after the desire of each man" (Esther 1:8)—an
oceanic moment of total continuity between subject and world, the me
and the not-me, in a social context without restriction or definition. This
is the response of the midrash:
God said to Ahasuerus, . . . Itisgenerallyunderstoodintheworldthat
if two men want to marry the same woman she cannot marry both of
them. And yet you order your people to behave "after the desire of each
man"! Tomorrow, two people will come to you in total  
confrontation— a Jew and his adversary—will you be able to satisfy both of them?
One of them you will promote and the other you will crucify.13
In the real world of limitation, two men cannot have one woman:
choices are to be made, the demands of the desirous self to be sifted. The
problem of ratzon (wish, will) subjects human beings to a lifetime of
evaluation and—in Freudian terms—to a world of discontents. But mish-
tehy the feast, promises something else: it evokes, along with Nietzsche,
"the lightfooted ones" against "the spirit of gravity— through [whom] all
things fall. Not by wrath does one will but by laughter. Come, let us kill
the spirit of gravity."
The birth of Isaac initiates the period of feasting and laughter, of the
bearable lightness of being. It has its precedent, of course, in the feast that
Abraham serves the angels who come to announce the imminence of the
birth. The passage opens with the cryptic words: "The Lord appeared to
him by the terebinths of Mamre" (18:1). Are we to understand that in the
midst of a mystical experience (God's "appearance to him"), he notices
the three travelers and invites them in so eagerly? On this view, the Sages
(and Rashi) base their praise of his hospitality, valuing concern for the
guest even above theophanies. But another reading is possible: the the-
ophany is the appearance of the angel travelers.14 This certainly seems a
plausible reading of the text: it does, however, turn the screw of paradox
much tighter than the other reading.
For this is perhaps the most sensuous description of a meal in the
Torah. Abraham's unassuming invitation is belied by the extravagant
lengths he goes to, the enthusiasm and energy he displays, in providing a
meal for the unequivocally described "three men." The moral point
about hospitality is amply made; but details like "choice flour" and "a

102
VA-YERA
calf, tender and choice" are read by Rashi, for instance, as directions for a
gourmet cookbook (18:6-7). All this gastronomic delight is fed the
angels, who then speak the word of God. And the whole event is called a
moment of theophany!
For in Abraham's world, feeding is an art, a physical sensual moment,
that nurtures the God-in-man. As in Gabriel Axel's film Babette's Feast, to
feed exquisitely is to bridge the gap between the physical and the  
spiritual; the feast becomes emblematic of the role of art in transforming the
monstrous into the human at its most expansive. In the film, the ascetic
Puritan challenge to hedonism is evoked: perhaps the godly folk should
eat the delicacies, so as not to offend the cook, but without tasting them.15
Thus they will achieve heroic spiritual standing. But what happens is
something quite different: sensuality is not sidestepped, but mobilized in
a movement to a fuller humanity.16
Rashi, in focusing on the techniques and delicacies of the feast, as well
as on the loving energy of Abraham, seems to be making a similar
statement. The fact that these are angels and that (in one reading, at any
rate) this encounter represents God's manifesting Himself in Abraham's
life, invites the reader to a new understanding of the human and its upper
register.17
J\brahamys eshel: oral alchemy
The central source for a discussion of Abraham as feast-and-festivity
maker ("I have rejoiced and spread joy everywhere") is the passage that
immediately precedes the Akedah narrative. In this context, Satan's
reproach to Abraham assumes the resonance of an argument against the
work of his life: "[Abraham] planted a tamarisk [eshel] at Beer Sheva and
invoked there the name of the Lord, the everlasting God" (21:33).
The nature of the mysterious eshel is discussed in the Talmud:
R. Yehudah said that this eshel was an orchard, while R. Nehemiah said
it was a hotel. . . . Resh Lakish said, Do not read the text, "He invoked
there the name of the Lord," but read it, "He caused there to be a
calling of the name of God"—Abraham caused God's name to ring out
in the mouth of every traveler. How was that? After they had eaten and
drunk, they would stand up to give him a blessing. He would tell them,
"Was it my food you ate? Was it not God's food you ate?" So they

Language and Silence
103
thanked and gave praise and blessing to the One Who spoke and the
world came into being.18
After the birth of Isaac, it seems, Abraham turns from the construction
of altars (12:7-8, 13:4) to that of hotels (or possibly the planting of
orchards). A common purpose underlies both ventures— "to invoke the
name of the Lord." Only in the eshel experience, however, the hotel-
orchard modality, does God become the "God of the world/' intimately
connected with the processes and becomings of the world.
The concept of the orchard (or the hotel with its varieties of comfort
and pleasure)19 is of a place of infinite earthly delight, in which the fantasy
and desire of each traveler is satisfied. (Eshel is taken by Rashi20 as an
acronym for Akhilah, Shetiyah, Levayah — eating, drinking, accompanying
on the first leg of the journey—the basic needs of the traveler.) In the
Beresbit Rabbah version of this midrash, the hotel is described by a play on
the letters ofEshel-Sha'al: "Ask [sha'al] for whatever you desire [tish'al] —
figs, and grapes, and pomegranates [in the case of an orchard], bread,
meat, wine, and eggs [in the case of a hotel]."21
This eshel, then, is a place where the stranger fulfills limitless desires,
the feeding place that is reminiscent of the infant at the breast. Suggested
here is the oceanic stage of experience, in which there is no clear
boundary between self and not-self. "Just as the breast is tasted by the
infant as having a variety of flavors, so the manna."22 This is Abraham's
radical initiative in the world: to nurture himself and others toward a
recognition of God. Through the mouth, the opening in the boundary
between self and world, nourishment and reassurance enters; and in the
mouth Abraham causes the name of God to be uttered —"Abraham
caused the name of God to ring out in the mouth of every traveler."
This oral alchemy is Abraham's invention: it takes account, one might
say, of the complexities and tensions inherent in the growth to fuller
humanity. For if we consider Winnicott's discussion of the development
of the infant, the most difficult stage is that between relating to an object
and use of the object. The infant must grow to a recognition of the
independent reality of objects (primarily the mother's breast) that he has
originally regarded as continuous with his own needs and desires. Once
embarked on this painful odyssey of separation from the object, eating
becomes an experience fraught with both vulnerability and destructive-
ness against the object. This is a destructiveness without anger. On the
contrary, it is accompanied by joy at the survival of the object. As a result,

104
VA-YERA
"the object is in fantasy always being destroyed, [which] . . . makes the
reality of the surviving object felt as such, strengthens the feeling tone,
and contributes to object-constancy. The object can now be used."23
In Winnicott's theory, in order to be able to use the object—and,
therefore, to love it, as real and external to the subject's omnipotent
control — both destructiveness and trust must be experienced—trust that
the object will survive one's use of it.24 Eating is a special case of the
dilemma of use and love; the eater experiences complex emotions toward
the feeder. (Noah feeds the animals in the Ark—and is attacked by the
lion for his trouble!)25
In this context, Abraham's answer to his grateful guests is  
illuminating: "Was it of mine [lit., of me] that you ate? Was it not of the God of the
world that you ate?" In Winnicott's terms, Abraham is helping his guests
through the anxiety of the transitional phase, to an experience of trust in
an Object who is the inexhaustible source of all life. To eat of Abraham's
substance must generate mixed feelings: to eat of the substance of God is
to be connected with a reality described in another version of the midrash
as "killing and animating, crushing and curing."26
Man's omnipotence is gone; the reality of God is beyond human
control, a total power over death and life. But that power is now given for
man's use and the nurturing of his life. In Abraham's alchemy of the feast,
vulnerability and trust, aggression and love find their harmony. The
guests ask: "How shall we bless Him?" (lit., hold onto goodness for
Him?). Abraham answers: "Say, 'Blessed be God who is blessed for ever
and ever! Blessed is He who gives bread and food to all flesh!'" God, in
these words that Abraham literally puts in their mouths after the food, is
the source of all blessing in time and space transcending man's range; He
is also the One who feeds each individual and therefore puts him in
intimate loving contact with that which is Other and incommensurate
with him. These are the words that Abraham teaches; his invention is the
movement from feeding and laughter to first words of separateness and
relatedness.
In the kabbalistic and midrashic literature, Abraham stands as the
paradigm for besedy the loving relation with others. In Ketubot 8b, for
instance, we read: "Our brothers act lovingly to one another, and are the
children of those who acted lovingly to one another, who maintain the
covenant of Abraham, our father." Rashi explains "Abraham's covenant"
as referring to the verse we are discussing: "We learn from his eshel, his

Language and Silence
105
'orchard-hotel/ that Abraham dealt in loving kindness." This is a rather
unexpected piece of deduction: the character of the Jewish people as
nurturers is made to spring from this cryptic narrative statement about
Abraham. As R. Hutner points out,27 a more obvious source for such a
characterization would be the verse, "I have singled him out, that he may
instruct his children and his posterity to keep the way of the Lord by
doing what is just and right" (18:19).28
Both sources, however, R. Hutner argues, are necessary for a full
understanding of Abraham's character of love (hesed). The latter source
stresses love as "the way of God." Rambam illuminates the implications
of "keeping the way of God," in a famous passage in Hilkhot Deot: "We
are commanded to walk in these [median] ways which are good and
straight, as it is said: 'You shall walk in His ways' (Deuteronomy 28:9).
This is how this commandment is interpreted: Just as He is called
gracious, so you be gracious; as He is called merciful, so you be  
merciful "29 To keep "the way of God" means, in Rambam's analysis, to
resemble God. Behind all the specifics of compassionate relations with
others lies the impulse to relate to God, to place one's feet within His
footprints. In this, Abraham acts as paradigm, as father par excellence, who
teaches his children a passion for God that embraces all his connections
with the world.30
The "orchard-hotel" initiative, however, represents Abraham in a
different dimension. Here, the passion is radically human, the capacity to
love others as oneself, which is a reaching out in separateness and
empathy, called in Ketubot, "Abraham's covenant." The paradigm of this
kind of love that seeks to feed and nurture others simply out of a sense of
shared humanity is the cryptic esbel, with all the midrashic accretions
around the word.
I\.eality and play
On this view, Abraham lives on two planes simultaneously, fed from two
sources. Radically alone in the world, he desires to approach God by
imitating Him; he equally desires to share with others his own human
experience of growth and freedom. The feast is his model of appetite
braving the hazards of a world of Others and learning to seek its  
satisfactions in trust and love.

106
VA-YERA
Do these two planes relate to each other? If the feast represents a
transitional area between inner psychic reality and external reality,31 then
perhaps its most powerful gift is the "potential space" that Winnicott
describes. At the point of emergence (literally, leaving the state of
merging-in-with-the-mother) into individuality, the baby repudiates the
object as the not-me. This is a dangerous stage, since separation is both
necessary and impossible. It is successfully achieved when the separation
itself is experienced as a loving gift of enlarged life, as, literally, a play
area, that yields limitless new possibilities for being. This area both
separates and unites mother and baby. Out of creative playing are  
generated symbols, a richness "that eventually adds up to a cultural life."32
Winnicott,s account of this "third area of human living, one neither
inside the individual nor outside in the world of shared reality," is
enormously fruitful when applied to our texts. Take, for example, this
passage from Tanhuma:
A baby is circumcised at eight days, just as Isaac was circumcised at
eight days. There is nothing dearer to a person than his son; and yet he
circumcises him. Why? In order to do the will of his Creator. He sees
his son gushing blood from his circumcision, and accepts it in joy.
Furthermore, he even incurs expense and makes that day a day of
rejoicing—which was not commanded. That is the meaning of the text
in Psalms [71:14]: "As for me, I will hope always, and add to the many
praises of You." And furthermore, a person will go and mortgage
himself, take out loans, in order to make that day a day of  
rejoicing. . . . When does a child become precious to his father? When he
begins to speak. That is the meaning of the text: "Truly, Ephraim is a
dear son to Me, a child that is dandled [yeled sha'ashuim]" [Jeremiah
31:20]. What is a child that is dandled? A three- or four-year-old who
begins to speak and is playful in the presence of his father.33
The midrash begins with the paradigm of Abraham's circumcision of
Isaac. Circumcision then becomes a model of human feeling submitting
to God's will—"to do the will of his Creator": nothing but this desire to
obey God could explain such an obvious violation of paternal feeling. Not
only does he obey, however; he unites will and emotion in a new  
experience of joy. "All joy wills eternity, wills deep, deep eternity" (Nietzsche).
He makes of the circumcision day a celebration; at great expense (not
merely financial?), he makes a feast, ase'udahshelmitzvah, and transforms
his rudimentary response to that day. The key phrase here, perhaps, is

Language and Silence
107
"which was not commanded": the father is so passionately concerned to
"do the will of his Creator," that, in effect, he begins to improvise.
The paradox is palpable: in order to obey a difficult law, in order to
become responsive to a radical demand on his life, the father cannot
simply submit. He must find the space between himself and his Creator-
Commander, out of which he may generate a kind of godly human play.
This is the transforming activity of imagination.
The prooftext focuses the idea: "I will hope always, and add to the
many praises of You."34 Man "hopes" for God not only in crisis, where
faith in salvation becomes a necessity. ("There are no atheists in foxholes"?)
Faith is a constant, existential awareness of objective reality as only one of
many possibilities; both God and man have the power of making and
breaking reality. In exercising his imagination, man meets God.
The thematic continuity of the midrash becomes clearer at this point.
For what underlies the sharp apparent change of topic, from the  
circumcision feast to the child's early speech development? Perhaps the theme of
the love of father for son? But it is not the baby of the first section who
becomes the talkative three-year-old of the second section. Rather, the
midrash explores the theme of play—the freedom with words, the puns
and jokes of the child beginning to use and love language — as a paradigm
for the creative activity of the father circumcising his baby.35
The child plundering the resources of language is asserting his sep-
arateness, his mastery of the resources of his culture. He is both  
participant and solitary: in Winnicott's terms, the child is alone only in the
presence of someone: "On the seashore of endless worlds, children play":
Winnicott quotes Tagore and interprets:36 babies come up out of the sea
of union with the mother and discover the endless worlds of play, of power
and danger in the margin that is neither sea nor land. The child in the
midrash is most loved, paradoxically, at the point where he asserts
separateness. The tension of union and separation, continuity and  
contiguity,37 is focused in the two words mishta'ashea le,aviv—"he is playful by
himself in the presence of his father."
The theme of the midrash essentially revolves around the question of
ratzon (will): the relation between human will (desire, life energy) and
God's will (obedience, submission). The passage suggests a third  
"transitional" area in which man grows in his capacity to make the world through
language and symbolism. This is the world of the feast, in which there is
no need to conquer and suppress one will in order to realize the other.

108
VA-YERA
Maharal carries this notion forward one more stage. In Netivot Olam,
in the section on lovingkindness,38 he quotes from Sotah 14a —a passage
similar to Rambam's discussion, quoted earlier, of the concept of walking
in the way of God. Here, the text is "Follow none but the Lord your God"
[Deuteronomy 13:5]; and the Talmud makes a similar point about  
imitating the loving acts of God. Maharal, however, inverts the logic of the
traditional equation: it is not the desire to imitate God (come closer to
Him) that generates the loving behavior of hesed, but rather it is by
coming to know and express the spontaneous, unforced energy in  
oneself, that is called hesed, that one apprehends the God-like in oneself.
Maharal moves from a theologically centered to an anthropologically
centered universe. In the world of hesed (as distinct from that of mishpat
[law], in which man acts out of necessity or obedience, and in that sense is
not God-like), man is truly in his element; he acts spontaneously and
naturally, and "walks in the ways of God" by acting of his own accord, of
his own free will and unforced consciousness (me-atzmo me-retzono ume-
da'ato). What emerges is something close to Berger's "inductive faith": a
"religious process that begins with the facts of human experience." It is
when man knows himself as world-making that he comes closest to the
Father whose creativity asks for the ultimate compliment of imitation.39
The playing of freedom and joy, the feast of circumcision, the  
beginnings of world-creating language, are traced in the passage from Tan-
huma back to the birth of Isaac. Word making (milah as both  
circumcision and word) is world making. What God desires of man is discourse
about the world: "How many acrobatics [strategies of indirection] did
God engage in, in order to hear the talk of righteous women!"40 Here,
the Jerusalem Talmud speaks of the involutions of the scene in which
God sends the angel to announce the birth of Isaac. The whole series of
dialogues and monologues (the angel speaks to Abraham, Sarah laughs
and talks to herself, God speaks to Abraham about Sarah's laughter, and
finally Abraham—or perhaps God? — tells Sarah, "But you did laugh") is
read as a strategy to elicit siah, discourse, from Sarah. By multiple
indirection, Sarah is left free to her own spontaneous reactions, in this
case, perhaps, a disappointing reaction. But the Talmud emphasizes the
strenuous importance of such a freedom, even when it involves fear,
skepticism, and prevarication.
In a powerful passage,41 Rashi writes of the necessity of human  
discourse, here called prayer, in the creation of the world (2:5):

Language and Silence
109
"When no shrub of the field was yet on earth and no grasses of the field had yet
sprouted, because the Lord God had not yet sent rain upon the earth and there
was no man to till the soil": . . . Before man was created, the vegetation
had not emerged, even though God had declared, on the third day of
Creation, "Let the earth bring forth grass." The vegetation had
stopped growing at the very surface of the earth, and had not emerged
until the sixth day. Why? Because God had not sent rain. And why had
God not sent rain? "Because there was no man to work the ground" —
that is, there was no one who could appreciate the goodness of rain.
When man came, and knew that rain is needed by the world, he prayed
for it, and it fell, and the trees and grasses grew.
The pun on stab ha-sadeh (vegetation/talk about the field) again evokes
Winnicott's "transitional space." The grass is both there and not there —
"it stood at the very surface of the earth." Man brings it into being by
knowing its potentiality and its absence. On the razor edge of trust and
need, he plays with the words that make worlds. Out of his own hungers,
he finds the language that touches off God's original intent. God holds
Himself under restraint ("God had not sent rain") till there exists a
subject capable of knowing his separateness from the world, his need and
love of the world.
L^anguage and play
In a famous passage, Abraham negotiates with God about the destiny of
Sodom. "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?" asks God
(18:17). In Bereshit Rabbab?2 God's special love for Abraham is expressed
thus: "I shall do nothing without his knowledge" —even in a case where
other considerations would seem to argue for secrecy. Abraham  
represents a more mature stage of human development than Adam or Noah:
their da'at, their knowledge, opinion, was found dispensable on at least
one occasion, and they are, respectively, expelled and imprisoned, and so
excluded from a significant understanding of their reality. Abraham is
never excluded; his consciousness (da'at) is valued by God, his reactions
courted even where they run, in an obvious sense, counter to the  
expressed intent of God.
So Abraham pleads for Sodom, "plays" God down from fifty  
righteous saviors of the city to ten. The core of his plea balances his concern
for God with his concern for humanity. "Shall not the Judge of all the

110
VA-YERA
earth deal justly?" (18:25). The midrashic reading transforms this  
rhetorical cry into a profound either-or statement: "The judge of the whole
earth shall not do justice —if it is a world You want, then strict justice is
impossible. And if it is strict justice You want, then a world is  
impossible."43
To judge the earth is to annihilate it (perhaps a pun on shofet-shotef, to
judge/to sweep away). Mishpat (justice) is the modality that human beings
can never appropriate as their own. Ein midat ha-mishpat midat ha-adam,
as Maharal says: mathematical exactness is not existentially suited to
human life. Inadvertently, or perhaps by the nature of their sensibility
and their language, human beings lie. "We invent for ourselves the major
part of experience," Nietzsche says in Beyond Good and EviL For weal or
for woe, mishpat, absolute standards of justice, cannot be realized in this
world as God has created it. To adhere to such standards is to destroy the
world; in order to build the world, besed, the generous perception of
alternative possibilities, is necessary.44
In another midrash,45 the destructive angel of Truth is thrown down to
earth, shattered into a thousand pieces, and can be reassembled only by
the combinations and compositions of human activity. (In an acrostic
formula, Emet Me-aretz Titzmah — "Truth springs up from the earth"
[Psalms 85:12] —the initial letters form the word Emet, truth. Now truth
is embedded in earth and carries the taste of earth; it has to be decoded
and reintegrated.)
Abraham, on this reading, gives God the benefit of his da'at, of his
personal opinion. From where he stands, hesed is the only modality in
which a world can survive. For indeed, his whole life has been concerned
with this one theme of potential, transitional space out of which the
creative words can rise. Here, he brings everything he knows back to
God; and God, who will do nothing without Abraham's perspective
being taken into account, enters into a dialogue that must inform His
own intention.
A similar image of "potential space" underlies the description of God
and Wisdom, as father and daughter, in Proverbs 8:30-31 (Soncino
translation):
Then I was by Him, as a nursling;
And I was daily all delight,
Playing always before Him,

Language and Silence
111
Playing in His habitable earth,
And my delights are with the sons of men.
Wisdom speaks here. Created before the world, she describes her own
development (w. 22-29) in the formless void: "When there were no
depths, I was brought forth" (v. 24); and her growth in the earliest stages
of separation and formation: "when the fountains of the deep showed
their might" (v. 28). The passage describes the "play area," the potential
space between all-encompassing Father and fully articulated world. This
is the area that the kabbalists called the hallal panui, the empty space
evacuated by God, who retrenched His total Presence in order to make it
possible for a world to emerge.
The cosmological drama described in Lurianic Kabbalah is  
understood in psychological terms by writers like R. Nahman of Bratzlav—in
terms, indeed, readily translatable into Winnicott's language.46 For the
"vacuum" left by God's loving retreat is tremulous and alive with  
possibility: panui implies "freedom^cr," not "freedom from";47 it suggests an
infinite "turning toward" of possible attentions and intentions.
The "nursling" (amon), as Wisdom describes its early stages of growth, is
an image of total trust and nurturance, containing the paradox of male
breast feeding, on the one hand, and a foster-child relationship, on the
other. (Moses' image of his relation to the Israelites, "as the nursing
father [omein] carries the suckling infant" [Numbers 11:12], is a  
surrealistic masculine projection of the nursing parent.) Rashi, for instance,
evokes the associations of the verse in Lamentations (4:5): "children who
were reared in [artificially habituated to] purple . . .")
Yet another level of meaning is provided by the association of amon
("nursling") with "artistry": the child Wisdom is represented as playing
in the transitional area between total union with the nursing Father and
the defined identities of the created world. This is the space of the artist,
of the child who creates objects expressing his alienation and his  
connection. And this "play" rejoices the Father; Wisdom speaks out of its own
experience, but includes the projected viewpoint of the Father ("Then I
was by Him, as a nursling"; "playing always before Him"; "in His habitable
earth")—as well as that of created "sons of men."48
The interplay between God and man is the area in which Wisdom
perpetually moves. This is a dance of ceaseless life ("daily," "always").
The child's play is free of the "anxiety of influence," Harold Bloom's
term for the artist's experience of oedipal anxiety—a modality in which

112
VA-YERA
predecessors threaten strangulation of new creativity and must be in
some sense destroyed, if the new is to survive. Here, the Father is no
threat to the son, nor the son to the Father. Instead, the child  
mysteriously becomes female; in the typology of the Torah, the  
father-daughter connection is both more fraught with tension than the father-son
relation, and less perilous, once its erotic freight is "domesticated."
epticism and joy
In Harold Fisch's phrase, what we find here is not the "anxiety of
influence,, —the successor-poet feeding on the precursor, but also  
needing to displace him—but rather the "Joy of Recognition."49 Fisch writes
of theories of literary influence; in terms of Winnicott's notion of the
growth to creativity in a more general psychological sense, the Joy of
Recognition remains a suggestive phrase.
For example, the opening section of Midrash Rabbah quotes our  
passage from Proverbs, connecting it with the first word of the Torah:
Bereshity "In the beginning." ("God made me as the beginning of His way"
[Proverbs 8:22].) In the midrash, Wisdom is identified with Torah; and
the essential activity of Torah is play. "If Your Torah were not my
plaything, I would have perished in my affliction" (Psalms 119:92; my
translation). The infinite resources yielded by possible combinations of
words (the kabbalistic tzirufin) in the Torah50 are not held in check by the
presence of the Father. On the contrary, each game leads back to Him and
to a knowledge of His delight. For these games create worlds, and are
man's intimation of his fearful resemblance to God.
Another association of the word amon, "nursling," is given in the
opening section of Midrash Rabbah. By the use of prooftexts, the midrash
sets up a continuum of meanings on the axis of "manifestation-hidden-
ness." Wisdom is amun, in the sense that it is partially revealed, capable of
being imparted; but it is also opaque, concealed, inviting the growing
child in her separateness to discover/create what no one can tell her. It is
this sense of the fecundity of hidden possibilities that "empowers" the
child, even as she remains in intimacy with the Father.
The life of Abraham can be viewed as the first biblical engagement
with the paradoxes of the potential space. As the incredible is promised
him, he laughs; and the age of Isaac ("laughter") begins. This is the age of
feasts, of bounty and trust and infinite possibility. But, significantly, to
&

Language and Silence
113
laugh is to make a choice; laughter is two-faced: "here for mockery, there
for joy."51
Abraham and Sarah represent the dialectics of laughter. When she
laughs in response to that which is hidden, yet to be uncovered,52 the text
has her laugh "inwardly" (18:12). Rashi comments: "She looked into her
innards and thought, 'Is it possible that these inner organs should carry a
child, or that these shriveled breasts should flow with milk?'" She is
constrained in her bowels, in a brute and arid factuality. She laughs the
hysterical laughter of tension: "Efshar— Can it be? How can I find a place
for possibility in an inner space that is totally defined? How can I see
these reduced particulars as charged, as involved in the uncertain  
throbbing of life?"
Characteristic of Sarah in its note of grim realism is the midrashic
soliloquy put in her mouth, as she awaits rape in Avimelekh's palace: "All
that night, Sarah lay on her face and said, 'Master of the Universe,
Abraham lives on promises, while I live on faith alone. He is outside the
prison, while I am placed inside the prison.' "53 Sarah's experience is
direct, physical, definitive. Matter is intractable and encloses her. God is
more effectively hidden in her world; hers, therefore, is a more difficult
faith than Abraham's, which is based on promises, transcendent intimations.
The narrative ends with Abraham being reconciled with Avimelekh,
and even making the absurdly empathic gesture of praying for him. The
midrash responds to this as, effectively, the first prayer-for-the-other.54
In a poignant phrase, the midrash describes the effect of such a prayer:
a knot of resistant reality is loosened by Abraham. The definitions that
separate self from other are swept away, a law of nature dissolves,  
widening possibility. As a result, not Avimelekh alone but Abraham himself
finally becomes fertile.
Sarah, however, represents the tension underlying such release.  
According to Ramban, she is not appeased. The enigmatic speech of
Avimelekh to her (20:16) he translates: "With all I could do, you  
continued resisting, protesting." And she is given credit for a kind of staunch
realism. Abraham's generous laughter is heard in contrast with her
skeptical laughter.
For Abraham in feasting/festive mode lives dangerously, trustingly in
the hallal panui, in that potential space where all is possible. In the
typology of the midrash, he is a mountain—mafkir lakol— offering  
multiple perspectives. His vision is polymorphous; naught is but what is not. "I

114
VA-YERA
am dust and ashes," he cries to God (18:27). Rashi comments: "I should
already have been dust at the hands of the kings, and ashes at the hands of
Nimrod, were it not [lulei] for Your mercy which has stood by me."
Lulei— "Were it not for Your mercy" — this is the characteristic Abraham
vision: alternative realities float in space, suspended by the creative will of
God. It is a metaphoric vision: "this is that—I am dust and ashes. My
existence is held lightly in God's hand."
But by the same token, transforming possibilities that may redeem
reality are also present. The work of hesed, the informing imagination
acting on a polymorphous universe, is essential both for God and for
vnzvL—hakol tzarikh le-hesed— everything is in need oihesed. "Is it of my
food you have eaten? Nothing is what it seems. The real food growing in
my orchard, served in my hotel is not human finite stuff, it is God's
substance —infinite, charged with love."
Jy±.etaphor and reality
The ultimate metaphoric statement of Abraham's life, however, is that
implied by the midrash with which we began. Satan accuses Abraham: in
a life of feasting, did he not have one turtle dove, one young bird for
sacrifice? And God answers (or God in Abraham responds, in other  
versions of the midrash, to his inner doubting): Ilu...Ifl were to say to
him. ... An alternative reality is imagined, a horrifying alternative
reality in which all Abraham's playing is crystallized into a hard residue.
What is the nature of that ratzon (wish, will) that has guided him so
playfully, so freely, in MaharaPs language, to a sense of imitating God? Is
it perhaps, after all, mere self-indulgence, self-interest?
"After all these things, God tested Abraham." Cumulatively, through
his learning and teaching, an anxiety builds up. Were all these things, this
fertile play of consciousness, were they grounded in the authentic desire
to be close to God? Or is all this a grotesque Satanic masquerade, in
which he is the fool and the victim?
For the main statement of his life has been the Ilu statement: I live in
the world of feasting and laughter, which imposes no overt constraints;
but, really, my life means total korban (sacrifice), total closeness to God,
even if this has never been literally translated into sacrifice. Like the lulei
statement ("Were it not for Your mercy"), the llu hypothesis issues from
the potential space of conditional realities. It is the ultimate credit note

Language and Silence
115
that Abraham has issued on the meaning of his life; now it is called in. A
time comes for testing; the hypothesis is unimaginably realized. And in
terms of the midrash, Satan's instigation of the test suggests a terrible
ambiguity. The need for testing—whose idea is it really? The skepticism
that drives Abraham to confirm new depths of himself—is this divine or
demonic?
It is within a similar tonal range of self-questioning that the Abraham
story is analyzed by the hasidic master, the Ishbitzer, in his book, Met Ha-
skiloah. He focuses on the structure of narratives leading up to the
Akedah. The final link in the chain of events is the covenant with
Avimelech, who tells Abraham: "God is with you in all that you do"
(21:22).
Until that point, he had felt distressed about things that were  
extraneous to his own being (literally, "to his own body"), in case there
might result a subversion of God's glory. When, however, Sarah said to
him, "Drive out this maidservant and her son," and God supported her
by saying, "Whatever Sarah tells you, obey her," then Abraham felt
very anxious, since he saw that even in the very seed of his loins there
was a force that might subvert God's glory. He was anxious that his
deeds were not acceptable to God. But when Avimelekh and Phikhol
told him, "God is with you in all that you do" — "all" includes even the
marginal products of his life, Ishmael as opposed to Isaac—these too
are good . . . then, he was consoled and said, "As a proof that I dug this
well" [21:30] —that is, "that I was the first person through whom
God's glory was made famous in the world, and who conditioned
people to call out in the name of God, God of the world."
And he planted an eshelin Beer Sheva, and consoled himself that God
was with him. After that, there rose in his mind another anxiety— How
could a human being boast about such a thing? And therefore it is said,
"And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days," on
which the midrash comments that days of distress are called "many
days" [Va-yikra Rabba, Metzora]. Therefore, he had the trial of the
Akedah, so that he should begin to evaluate himself and to evaluate all
the preceding trials. On this trial depended all the others, and he might
have lost all of them, God forbid. . . . But when he saw that it lay in his
power to deliver everything to God, then he understood that in  
everything that he had undergone till now he had done the will of God.55
The Ishbitzer here portrays the dialectical tension characterizing
Abraham's life. After early episodes, such as the battle to save Lot from

116
VA-YERA
the four kings (chap. 14), or Abraham's prayer of intercession for Sodom,
he finds himself vulnerable to radical doubts about the ultimate Tightness
of his generous impulses. The question, "What (who) will come of it?" —
good or evil —is never finally resolved, and Abraham experiences all the
anguish of indeterminacy in his evaluation of his own acts.
The dialectics of anxiety and consolation are the motif that the Ish-
bitzer traces; in the case of Sodom, anxiety gives place to reassurance,
which spirals into newly intensified anxiety. The secret fear coiled at the
base of his tree of life is that he may be responsible for a "subversion of
God's glory"; the tragic-ironic possibilities of a destiny undercut by
subconscious demons, a destiny acted out in cruel self-deception.
The awareness of forces within himself that may subvert all his  
conscious intentions comes to a head over the matter of his children. Here,
the issue of his own body—Ishmael —is rejected by God. Ishmael is the
rapacious hunter, portrayed in the midrash as a highwayman lurking at
the crossroads, plundering, demonically connected to others by hunger:
"his hand against all, and every hand against him" (16:12).56 Like Abraham,
he creates a new reality, as the world mirrors him back to himself. Ishmael
thus represents a parody of Abraham's work in transitional space. But,
like all parodies, Ishmael comes from his loins, threatens his life: how can
Abraham not be radically suspicious of himself?
He is reassured by Avimelekh's unconsciously gnomic words — "God
is with you in all that you do"—which he decodes as an assurance of his
essential integrity in all the generous and imaginative acts of his life. Even
what seems most questionable in his biography is ultimately in tune with
his noblest intentions.
At this point, he formulates his own original contribution to the world:
he is the first to engage in the feasting work, the eshel of potential space,
which teaches men of all kinds to trust and love the God who is not part of
them but can be encountered by them. This difficult project he now
stamps with the seal of authenticity — only to be assailed once again with a
fear of complacency and self-congratulation. In a new shift of perception,
Abraham recognizes the inadequacy of such smugness.
In the climactic phase of painful self-examination, the Ishbitzer  
describes the Akedah as, in fact, inevitable ^Therefore he had the trial of the
Akedah"). Abraham is compelled at this point to sift through his whole
experience and come to some clarity. Existentially, all hangs now on the
Akedah, which will prove, crystallize out, the basic truth of all his

Language and Silence
117
engagements with the world. What is probed here is the question of
being-with-God in all he has done. Now, remorselessly, his search for
truth leads him to test the metaphor of his existence: "Is it of my
substance you have eaten?"
If the Ishbitzer speaks here of the logic of a life leading inevitably to an
Akedah, then perhaps the midrash with which we began can be read in
the same way. God answers Satan's aspersions: Abraham's life is  
authentically centered, in spite of its apparent lack of structure. God asserts:
"The feasting is potentially capable of metamorphosis into korban  
[sacrifice]; in translated form, it is a search for closeness to God." And the
assertion is immediately (miyad) followed by "God tested Abraham." Now,
Abraham must face his darkest dreams; an act of clarification will decode
his whole existence.
The return to silence
One of the paradoxes of this hermeneutical act is that it invites a return to
silence. Abraham's laughter, through which he communed with others,
was a "pseudo-language," in which "silence is the essence." Now this
essence is explored to its full, almost intolerable, extent. To live in a world
in which the essential is experienced implicitly, wordlessly, is to return to
the base out of which laughter, feeding, and ultimately speech emerged.
Kierkegaard approaches the paradox of the Akedah, which renders
him sleepless, in this way: "Abraham cannot be mediated; in other words,
he cannot speak. As soon as I speak, I express the universal, and if I do not
do so, no one can understand me."57 The "teleological suspension of the
ethical," in Kierkegaard's phrase, is expressed in the vibration of Abraham's
silence. Only after the Akedah, according to Rashi, does Abraham return
to the mode of siha, of language, articulation, personal viewpoint:
"Abraham said to Him, 'Let me spread before You my siha1" (22:12).
In one source for this midrash, Abraham says: "It is revealed and
known to You that at the time that You told me, 'Bring him up there as a
burnt offering,' I had an answer for You. . . . But I suppressed myself in
order to do Your will."58 "I had an answer for You" —to articulate one's
position is normally not only a legitimate defense, but even part of God's
education of mankind. Rashi (3:9), for instance, explains God's call to
Adam, Ayeka— "Where are you?" —as an invitation to response, to  
dialogue. In confrontation with God, Adam's salvation can only lie in

118
VA-YERA
creating his own reality. To foreclose responses is to deny man his limited
but essential perspectives. Here, however, Abraham, facing the truth of
his life, returns the words to their source; for in potential space there is no
simple plotting of positions.
Silence is the ultimate modality of Abraham. In a classic midrash, R.
Akiva describes four reactions to suffering: "A king had four sons: one
would be silent when beaten; one would kick out; one would entreat
forgiveness; and one would ask for more punishment. Abraham was silent
when suffering, as it is said, 'Take your son.' He could have said,  
'Yesterday, You told me, "In Isaac your seed will be named."' "59 "He could have
[should have?] responded. . . ." But he says nothing. He leaves the world
behind and climbs to cloud-ringed mountains60 with Isaac, in silence.
Now, the emptiness, or the demonic fullness (for Satan accompanies him
every step of the way) of that potential space is to be experienced in a
muteness that encompasses all words.
R. Nahman of Bratzlav61 takes this experience as the type of true
confrontation with the hallal panui, that space from which God has
withdrawn. A terrible descent—to the roots of the matter—is involved
here. Articulated worlds and words are God's creative expression, but
underlying them is fazma^amarsatum (the blocked word), in which God,
it seems, has entirely inhibited His self-expression. Here, nothing is
clearly said; and yet all articulate words receive their vitality from this
inchoate silence. The only words spoken are, "Where is the sheep?"
(22:7). R. Nahman hears in the question the pregnant echoes of all ayeh
(where?) questions: "Where is the place of His glory?" In this obscurity,
man knows God as distant, yielding to no form of words other than the
howl of loss and loneliness.
But this very loneliness is the energy that gives life to man: the
yearning informs the emptiness as no fulfillment could. "Where is the
sheep for the burnt offering?" The burnt offering is traditionally  
understood as atoning for inner doubts and denials. The redemptive gesture is
the Ayeh cry, all liquid vowels, emerging inarticulately from silence. It is
the cry that atones for loss by expressing loss. So, paradoxically, a return is
achieved to that beginning of things, Bereshit, before words and  
structures, the ?na'amar satum, with which all creativity must firstly engage.62
For R. Nahman, this encounter with "potential space," in all its
anguish, must precede any original achievement, even in Torah study.
Sureness of step involves in its very rhythms a knowledge of vertigo. To

Language and Silence
119
speak with the clarity of the poet is to hear in the silence the babble of
infinite combinations.
In the end, the "prodigious paradox"63 of the Akedah focuses on the
question of korban (sacrifice). Satan insinuates that Abraham's feasting is
essentially babble; closeness to God is not Abraham's underlying passion
("He did not have it in him ... to sacrifice [k-bakriv] — to move toward
greater involvement with God"). But Abraham's longing for God is
manifested most intensely in alienation and obscurity. "And he saw the
place from afar" (22:4), in a hasidic reading, suggests an essential  
dimension of the trial.
The movement toward intimacy
The Talmud teaches that if one travels to a distant synagogue, one
receives reward for the journey, even if one might have prayed more
conveniently at a nearer synagogue.64 Maharal questions this: on what
principle is this so, since going a distance to fulfill any other  
commandment (e.g., to reach a Sukkah, where a nearby Sukkah is available) would
not bring reward? He answers: "Because God is found in the synagogue,
and therefore this is said precisely of traveling to a synagogue, for in this a
person is (literally) drawn after God"65
R. Hutner discusses this cryptic statement.66 The essential point, he
says, is that prayer is existentially different from all other activities. It
reflects a situation in which man stands in the presence of God. It is not
the words of the prayer that define the situation, for even after he finishes,
if he has not physically moved his feet, he "still stands in the presence of
the King."67 Prayer is an act involving body and spirit in relationship with
God; it uniquely is called kirvat Elokim, a situation of closeness to God.
Moreover, Ritva rules that the pilgrim, journeying toward the place of
prayer, is already involved in the mitzvah, not merely in its preparatory
stages.68 The concept of traveling toward a place of relationship is then
read as part of the mitzvah itself. For traveling, movement toward, is a
gesture to diminish distance —and that is the whole point of prayer. So
that to travel to a distant synagogue is to express yearning in action. And
the situation of man experiencing intimacy with God includes a dynamic
process in which desire confronts alienation.
Abraham travels (the word lekh> go, is a motif in the narrative; cf. 22:2,
3, 5, 6, 8, 19) far to the place of closeness. Korban (sacrifice) and tefilah

120
VA-YERA
(prayer) are traditionally understood to be based on this common motif
of kirvat Elokim (closeness to God). The relationship that Abraham seeks
is real, but embedded in the Ay eh experience of confusion and yearning.
In the end, the korban^ the expression of intimate relationship, is  
translated into the language of "traveling." The full knowledge of the enigma
is turned to redemptive purpose by the sheer force of Abraham's desire.
right to feast
Satan's undermining voice acutely associated the feasting with the  
question of relationship with God: "Of all the feasts that Abraham made, did
he not have one turde dove, one young bird to bring close to You?" The
korban that is to express Abraham's deepest intentionality must arise out of
the feast, in order to make sense of (to clarify, in the Ishbitzer's words) his
project. It is remarkable, therefore, to read in Tanhuma an account of
Abraham's preparation for the sacrifice:
Abraham said, "What shall I do? If I reveal it to Sarah, female agitation
will certainly overcome her in such an enormous matter. And if I don't
reveal it to her now, but only later when Isaac is no longer here, she will
kill herself." What did he do? He said to Sarah, "Prepare food and
drink for us, and let us eat and rejoice." She asked, "How is today
different from other days? What is the nature of this joy?" He  
answered, "Old people like us, who have had a child in their old age—
surely we should eat, drink, and rejoice!" She went and prepared the
food. When they were in the middle of the meal, he said to her, "You
know, when I was three years old I first knew my Creator, and this boy
is already mature and has not been initiated. There is a place, rather far
from us, where boys are initiated —let me take him, and initiate him
there." She said, "Go in peace."69
"Eat, drink, and rejoice —why else were we given a son in our old
age?" Abraham re-iterates the meaning of his life, though Satan mocked
it. "This old man! You granted him fruit of the womb at a hundred years
old — and of all the feasts he made, he did not have one turtle dove . . . !")
Now, Abraham is about to justify the intentionality of his feasts.
Unwillingly, Sarah asks the probing question, "What is the nature, the
true quality of this rejoicing?" But it is Abraham who has set her up to
hear his vindication. "In the middle of the meal," out of the full experi-

Language and Silence
121
ence of the feast, Abraham then declares his intent—obliquely, so as to be
understood only after the feast.
The climax of the Akedah is the displacement of Isaac by the ram: "He
went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his
son" (22:13). Rashi comments on the redundant "in place of his son":
Over every part of the ritual that he performed with the ram, he prayed,
"May it be Your will that this act should be as though [ke'eelu] it were done
to my son—as though my son were slaughtered, as though his blood were
sprinkled, as though he were flayed. . . ."
The rhetorical motif of Abraham's prayer is ke'eelu—"Look at it as
though. . . ." Abraham has earned the right to metaphoric substitution.
Now, Abraham can speak again; his prayer rises out of his silence. The
ram, created at twilight on the last day of Creation,70 has been waiting in
the wings for the moment at which it becomes Abraham's son. (Tahat
expresses equi-valence, displacement.)71 The twilight animal, demonic,
creature of potential space, becomes a symbol, vibrant with the meanings
that Abraham articulates to all time—to God Himself.
Primary among all blessings, is the blessing of peace. The list of
blessings in Leviticus 26 begins with rain, fertility of the soil ("and you
shall eat your bread to satisfaction"), and culminates, according to Rashi,
in the promise of peace: And I shall grant peace in the land: lest you say,
"Here is food, here is drink—but if there is no peace, there is nothing"
(Rashi, Leviticus 26:6).
One implication of Rashi's comment may be that—in Winnicott's
terms — the anxiety and destructiveness arising out of the  
feeding-experience, in a being who no longer regards the world as an extension of
himself, has to be engaged with and mastered. For the infant, "the object
is always being destroyed"; it is this that convinces him of its externality.
But where the object survives, where the infant can express aggression in
ultimate trust, a new balance of connection and independence is set up.
Love becomes possible.
Abraham, in his act of "clarification," confronts the hazards of "eating
and drinking." Fear and destructiveness are the shadows that he must
battle, if he is to achieve a new rigor of love. God is being found, is not
simply placed by the subject in the world.72 If Abraham can live through
the reality of his fear of God as totally Other, then his love will become
not simply a "bundle of projections" but the love of a real Presence.

122
VA-YERA
This is love as courage, the final praise Abraham receives from God
after the trial is over: "Now I know that you fear God, since you have not
withheld your son, your favored one [though you were free to do so,
might have done so] from Me" (22:12). Abraham, who confronts his fear
and his pain, his aloneness and his uncertainty, is a heroic being.  
Ultimately, he is remembered for his "love of Me" (Isaiah 41:8). "Those who
love Him are as the sun when he goes forth in his might" [my translation]
(Judges 5:31).73 The "might" of love is its capacity to confront fears of all
kinds, to absorb them in a kind of joy at the survival of lover and beloved.

HAYYEI SARAH W
Vertigo—The Residue
of the Akedah
Oarah ys cries
Sarah's lifetime — the span of Sarah's life—came to one hundred and
twenty-seven years. Sarah died in Kiryat Arba—now Hebron—in the
land of Canaan; and Abraham proceeded to mourn for Sarah and to
bewail her. (23:1-2)
Following the climactic moment of Moriah, the Torah turns to the
world of procreation and death. There is the chain of continuing births in
far-away Haran, with Rebecca's name discreetly introduced to signal a
future (22:23); the death of Sarah; and the quest for a wife for Isaac, to
continue Abraham's line. Deaths, births, marriages; the Parsha is titled
by its opening words, "The life of Sarah"; in a covert sense, Sarah's life is
germinal to the whole reading. The problem of her life is manifested just
at the moment of her leaving it.
Our starting point is Rashi's comment (23:2), startling in its  
implications, on the structure of the narrative: "The death of Sarah is narrated
directly after the Akedah, the Binding of Isaac, because, as a result of the
tidings of the Akedah—that her son had been fated for slaughter, and had
been all-but-slaughtered— she gave up the ghost [lit., her soul flew away]
and died.'\*
Here, Rashi is succinctly summarizing a complex midrashic tradition,
which holds at its core a poignant thesis: Sarah is the true victim of the
Akedah, her death is its unexpHcated, inexplicable cost. Closer attention
to Rashi's words, however, heightens the tension even further. For Rashi
chooses one among several midrashic possibilities to narrate Sarah's final
trauma. It is fascinating to consider the implications of some of these
123

124
HAYYEI SARAH
possibilities, and perhaps to arrive at a fuller appreciation of Rashi's
choice.
Here, first, is the version found in Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer:
When Abraham came from Mount Moriah, Samael [Satan] was furious
that he had failed to realize his lust to abort Abraham's sacrifice. What
did he do? He went off and told Sarah, "Ah Sarah, have you not heard
what's been happening in the world?" She replied, "No." He said,
"Your old husband has taken the boy Isaac and sacrificed him as a burnt
offering, while the boy cried and wailed in his helplessness [lit., for he
could not be saved]. Immediately, she began to cry and wail. She cried
three sobs, corresponding to the three Teki'ah notes of the Shofar, and
she wailed (Yelalot) three times, corresponding to the Yevava, staccato
notes of the Shofar. Then, she gave up the ghost and died. Abraham
came and found her dead, as it is said, "And Abraham came [literal
translation] to mourn for Sarah and to bewail her."1
In this version of the midrash, Satan lies to Sarah. He paints for her the
horror and pathos of an old, demented father actually killing a helplessly
crying child. Her death from a stroke, or heart attack, might seem
naturalistic, evoking no surprise, were it not for the strange detail about
her "cries and wails," which are transformed into the throbbing Shofar
wails. This surrealistic connection is found in many sources. Essentially,
the suggestion is that Isaac's death cries, expressing the unsaveability of
the creature in the grip of overwhelming forces, are echoed mimetically
by Sarah, also held fast in an irremediable anguish, and that these are
reenacted in our ritual to redemptive effect. "The Shofar blasts on the
New Year are to transform Sarah's death into atonement, because the
Teru'ah — xhe broken Shofar tone —is groaning and wailing."2
This enigmatic etiology of the Shofar cry is found in a whole range of
midrashic sources. The more obvious notion that the Shofar, the ram's
horn, evokes the substitution of the ram for Isaac at the moment of actual
sacrifice thus takes on a more tragic and paradoxical cast. Isaac is saved,
and the Shofar announces the possibility of redemption, of symbolic
substitutions. But Sarah is not saved, and, in the world of her mind, Isaac
is not saved, and yet the cries of her—and his—despair are retained in
liturgy and ritual, "as an atonement" for her descendants.
How is wailing, the Yelala ululation which is the hollow throb of
despair, the sound that expresses essential Nothingness,3 how does this

Vertigo—The Residue of the Akedah
125
become atonement? For the meaning of this howl, the howl of jackals in a
wilderness, is negation. "They did not cry out to Me sincerely, as they lay
wailing," Hosea says (7:14). This ululation, Yelala, is the opposite of the
seeking cry of connection and loss. It echoes inhumanly in the passive
anguish of nightmare.
The second midrashic source for Rashi's comment is from Tanhuma:
Just as Abraham stretched out his hand to take the knife, a heavenly
voice came forth and said to him: "Do not stretch out your hand
against the boy." If it were not for that, he would already have been
slaughtered. At that time, Satan went to Sarah and met her in the guise of
Isaac. When she saw him, she said, "My son, what has your father done
to you?" He answered, "My father took me and led me up hill and
down dale, till he took me up to the top of one mountain, built an altar,
and laid it out, and arranged the wood, and bound me on top of the
altar, and took the knife to slaughter me. If it had not been that God
told him, \* Don't stretch out your hand against the boy/ I should
already have been slaughtered." Satan did not manage to finish the
story when Sarah died [lit., her soul flew away].4
In this version, a more subtle anguish, a more terrible irony leads to
Sarah's death. For the devastating fact is that Isaac clearly is alive, in
Sarah's eyes, as he tells the unbearable saga of his father's murder of him.
On the face of it, Sarah dies, simply because of lo hispik, because she
cannot endure to the end of the story. But before Satan can furnish the
redemptive denouement, he has destroyed, artfully, precisely, Sarah's
vision of her husband and of her life's mission. Satan's tale is told as
subversion; the ending is almost irrelevant, for Isaac stands before her— a
ruined Isaac, who can only elicit horrified questions from her—"What
has your father done to you?"
The ironic force of the midrash, then, lies not so much in the lo bispik,
in the fact that the relief of resolution is delayed (a classic literary strategy,
the love letter that arrives fifty years—or one day—late) as in the eelulei,
the remorseless fatality that is interrupted, almost arbitrarily. Abraham's
will to kill Isaac, narrates the midrash, would have known no softening.
Effectively, Isaac would have been dead, were it not that . . . eelulei. . . .
This is part of the truth of the Akedah, and it is this partial truth that
Satan "immediately," in the frustration of his larger desire, goes off to
exhibit to Sarah. In a voyeuristic trance, Sarah dies of it. Satan's desire is
ironically expressed in the previous midrash as the desire to abort the

126
HAYYEI SARAH
sacrifice; in the event, the sacrifice is not literally carried out, but neither
is it aborted: in some sense, apparently, it is indeed realized.
The third version of the midrash is the most enigmatic:
"Abraham did not rejoice in My world and you seek to rejoice?" He
had a son at the age of a hundred. And in the end, God said to him,
"Take your son. . . ." So Abraham took Isaac, his son, and led him up
hill and down dale, and up to the top of one mountain, and he built an
altar and arranged the wood, and took the knife to slaughter him. And
were it not that the angel called out from heaven, he would already have
been slaughtered. Know that it is so, for Isaac then returned to his
mother and she said to him, "Where have you been, my son?" He
answered, "My father took me and led me up hill and down dale. . . ."
She said, "Woe upon the son of the drunken woman! Were it not for
the angel, you would already be slaughtered?" He said, "Yes." At that,
she screamed six times, corresponding to the six Teki'ab notes. She had
not finished doing this when she died. As it is written, "Abraham came
to mourn for Sarah and to bewail her."5
The central thesis of the midrash is the impossibility of full joy in this
world. Abraham is the example of a terrible testing, which is resolved in
the saving of his son and vindication of his own purity of intent. But this
joy is then undercut by Sarah's death. The implied connection between
the Akedah and Sarah's death becomes a prooftext for meaninglessness,
within the parameters of this life. The midrash continues to speak
ultimately even of God's lack of joy in His world: joy belongs to the
future, affirms the midrash, not to the troubled middle-distance of
temporal reality. "His world" becomes, by definition, an environment
hostile to joy.
The paradoxical quality of Sarah's death is brought to a head in this
midrash. As in the first midrash (from Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer), she cries and
wails as she dies. But here she dies, not of disinformation, but of a terrible
truth. As in the second midrash, her anguish prevails despite — or perhaps
because of—Isaac's survival. But here, there is no Satanic figure, even in
disguise: all is truth—Isaac confronting his mother, her questioning of
him—all is an exploration of a truth that the midrash offers to grapple
with. "Were it not... he would already have been slaughtered." "Know,"
insists the midrash, "that it is so. . . ."
How terrible is the grace of the Eelulei here. Hesed, God's generosity,
illuminates nothing for Sarah; it merely sheds stark light on the endless

Vertigo — The Residue of the Akedah 111
darkness surrounding it.6 For Sarah dies of the unbearable lightness of
being; the restoration of Isaac in no way palliates the horror of what
might well have been. For Sarah, this is not a "test," a three-day trial of
faith, culminating in rescue and vindication. She, rather than Abraham,
faces the full anguish of the "already slaughtered" one: his survival
changes nothing. Her invocation to him holds the fall measure of her
situation: "Woe to the son of the drunken woman!" The image of her
own unhinging, of an ecstasy (literally, a standing outside oneself), in
which all stability is undermined, involves mother and son in a miasma of
absurdity.
vertigo
When Rashi says, therefore, that Sarah dies of the news that her son was
all but killed, he is very precisely indicating the fall paradox of the
midrashic narrative. She dies not simply because she cannot endure to
the end of the story: that would constitute a relatively primitive tragic
irony. She dies of the truth of kime'at sbelo nishhat— of that hair's breadth
that separates death from life. This is what Sartre calls "contingency,"
the nothingness that "lies coiled in the very core of being, like a worm."7
Maharal explains the concept of Sarah's death from contingency in his
own terms: "This is the human reaction of panic, on realizing that only a
small thing separated one from such a fate."8 (This is a literal translation
of kime'at sbelo nisbhat—"\* little thing decided his fate.") The word for
panic, behala, expresses the notion of vertigo, so central to existentialist
philosophy. This is the naked anxiety of "not being able to preserve one's
being."9 Paul Ricoeur speaks of the vertigo of "being already born that
reveals to me the non-necessity of being here." "Vertigo comes from the
possibility there was of being different, of not having been at all." The
potential anguish of the contingency of birth is fally activated only by the
"accident which actually makes me die. . . . Only my death will one day
fulfill the contingency of my birth and will lay bare the nothingness of
this non-necessity of having once been born."10
The vertigo of existence in a world of kime'at sbelo nishhat, a barely and
provisionally escaped Nothingness, is expressed by Job: "He it is who
stretched out Zaphon over chaos, Who suspended earth over emptiness
[b Hi-mah — lit., without what—devoid of substance, even of questioning]"

128
HAYYEI SARAH
(26:7). To be suspended in mid-air is to live in suspense, in a condition of
radical and constant doubt of the continuity of one's being.
Such a condition of existential doubt is described in Deuteronomy
(28:66) as the very nadir of the cursed human condition: "The life you
face shall be precarious [lit., suspended in front of you]; you shall be in
terror, night and day, with no assurance of survival." In this state, one
loses faith in the life thrust, Bergson's elan vital. Rashi comments on this
suspension of life: "The text speaks of doubt. Everywhere, doubt is called
the condition of suspense, whether one will die today." The knowledge of
one's contingency, the vertigo of being, is expressed in the instability, the
dizzying symmetry of equivalent possibilities.
On this view, Sarah dies of radical doubt. She suffers an attack of
vertigo, and, as the midrash concludes, lo hispita, she has not managed to
finish her crying and wailing before she dies. It is striking to compare this
version with the Tanhuma version, in which it is Satan who does not
manage to furnish her with a happy ending to the story. Here, much
more subtly, it is she who is active throughout. No one deceives her, Isaac
lives and tells his story, she questions him, she screams six TekVab notes,
and she dies before she can finish them. The profundity of her anguish is
suggested in every detail. But what does she not finish, what does she not
furnish (sefeka is power, means, possibility) to herself or to her world, so
that her death becomes an interruption, rather than a conclusion?  
Perhaps it is the very process of safety of doubt, the vertigo of Nothingness,
that she has not had the stamina to live through, to its end?
Isaac's ashes
The problem of Sarah's death is, profoundly, the problem of her life, of
hayyeisarah—of the contingency of the already born, the all but dead. Her
perception of mortal vertigo is displaced onto Isaac's time'atsbelo nishhat
experience. In a real sense, as the Sages put it, "His ashes remain piled on
the altar,"11 though he may walk the earth, as large as life. What  
happened at the Akedah cannot be neutralized, though the sacrifice is not
literally consummated. The burden of the "all but" condition is assumed
by Sarah, who consummates its meaning in her howls and her death.
The existential status of "Isaac's ashes" —an important theme in the
midrash—is explored in an essay by R. Yitzhak Hutner.12 In some  
absolute sense, the ashes indicate a negation of life; they represent symbol-

Vertigo— The Residue of the Akedab 129
ically the metaphysical pessimism13 expressed most poignantly by the
Sages: "It would have been better [lit., less strenuous] for man never to
have been created than to have been created."14
The mystery of this negation is felt by many readers: Maharsha,15 for
instance, notes the radical tension it sets up with the primary evaluation
of human life—"Behold, it was very good" (Genesis 1:31). The  
superlative "very" is reserved only for Man. The midrash even points to the
anagram of "adam me'od": only the human represents the intensified
good of creation. The tension between this metaphysical optimism, and
the pessimism of the statement in Eruvin is the subject of R. Hutner's
essay. He argues that it is precisely out of this tension that me yod, the
uniquely human intensity, is generated. Only through a fully experienced
knowledge of the abyss where "it would have been better for man not to
have been created," can a rigorous, even a tragic optimism be achieved.
R. Hutner makes use of the talmudic terms, hava amina and maskana,
to structure his argument. In talmudic discourse, even a hypothesis that is
ultimately rejected is examined closely and seriously. In some sense, it
remains live, even if it is not the one to be pragmatically adopted. He
applies this dialectical principle to the metaphysical question. The  
dilemma of "To be or not to be" has an ultimately optimistic conclusion;
but this can be reached only through an authentic and total involvement
in the meaning of negation. There has to be a suspension of belief and
affirmation, a kind of philosophical schizophrenia, in which the  
theoretical optimistic conclusions of faith are ignored, and only the cries and
wails of Nothingness are heard.
This dialectical tension prevails in many areas, as R. Hutner  
indicates.16 But here, in the existential sphere, it is perhaps most crucial. The
groans and wails of the Shofar on Rosh Hashana express the core  
dimension of human life: "it would have been better for man never to have been
created." But in the very heart of this burning recognition arises the
affirmative flame of the "very good." When the angel negates negation,
when he calls out, "Do not raise your hand against the boy" (22:12), Isaac
is restored to life. But, at the same time, his ashes remain on the altar; the
total surrender of the burnt offering, leaving no residue of hope, no tissue
of illusion, is not neutralized.
This core knowledge of paradox—"Without contraries there is no
progression" (Blake) —is Isaac's radical experience, bequeathed to his
children. "Happy are the people who know the Teru'ah [note of the

130
HAYYEI SARAH
Shofar]; O Lord, they walk in the light of Your presence" (Psalms 89:16).
To know the brokenness, the hollow resonance of the Shofar, is to
sharpen one's hearing for the affirmations of faith.
The negation of negation
Yet these are real ashes —the kind out of which nothing can emerge—
quite unlike Abraham's "dust and ashes" (18:27), which contain potential
of fertility; for dust is the materia of life. And these cries and howls issue
from the other side of silence, from the "non-silence" {lo dumiyah), of
which the Psalmist so bitterly complains: "My God, my God, why have
You abandoned me? . . . My God, I cry by day—You answer not; by
night, and no silence is given me" (Psalms 22:2-3; my translation). Andre
Neher writes: " 'Nonsilence' is a silence more silent than silence. It is the
fall of silence, into a deeper stratum of nothingness; it is a shaft hollowed
out beneath silence which leads to its most vertiginous depths."17 The
"opacity" of meta-silence gives rise to terror, the essential Yirah of Isaac's
life, with which Sarah, unguarded and unprepared, is fatally assailed.
In a different dimension, Paul Ricoeur writes of negation as the
"privileged language" of the experience of finitude.18 Want is expressed
negatively as an "I don't have"; the past is "no longer," the future "not
yet," and death "nothingness." This "primal negation" Ricoeur  
associates with Spinoza's "sadness": "By sadness, I mean a passion by which the
soul passes to a lesser perfection." This leads him to the idea of a "default
of subsistence," which he applies to the experience of "vague vertigo
which flows from the joint meditation on birth and death." To transcend
this primal negation is possible only by a "negation of negation," which
he terms, "denegation." This is the mode of "in spite of," the mode that
differentiates denegation from annihilation. ("I think, I want, in spite of
my finitude.")
Ricoeur then proceeds to a brilliant demonstration that "the soul of
refusal, of recrimination, of contestation, and, lastly, of interrogation and
doubt, is fundamentally affirmation." Sartre's VEtre et le Neant  
postulates that nothingness of being is an ontological characteristic of human
life; doubt, interrogation, absence, anguish create the possibility of  
freedom. The act of "nihilating withdrawal" from the passions, the  
"suspension" of judgment that frees the thinking "I" from entanglements and
rootedness in the world of nature and the senses —this is the essence of

Vertigo—The Residue of the Akedah 131
freedom for Sartre: "the human being putting his past out of play by
secreting his own nothingness."19
At the heart of Sartre's "nothingness," however, Ricoeur discovers a
new affirmation. "I repudiate a past of myself only because I assume
another past." What really happens is not a severance of all connections,
entanglements: "rather, I am aware of liberating in myself what remained
inhibited, refused, impeded. I have only repudiated shackles, denied
negations. . . . Hence, by means of negations ... I have constituted a
better continuation of myself."
Ricoeur's model of annihilation and denegation is, I suggest, a useful
key to the problematics of the Akedah and Sarah's death. For these take us
into that meta-silence of which Andre Neher writes —into that bitter
realm of real ashes. As I want to show, Sarah's life has been profoundly
concerned with issues of freedom and disentanglement. And the  
possibility of transcendence is indeed realized in the narrative—and in mid-
rashic comment on the narrative —in the language of denegation—the
negation of negation.
At the resolution of the Akedah, the angel calls out—merely? —"Do
not raise your hand against the boy, do not do anything to him, for now I
know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son from Me"
(22:12). The double negatives—not to destroy, not to withhold—thus
become the basis of blessing and affirmation in the second call of the
angel: "Because you have done this — and have not withheldyour son, I will
bestow My blessing upon you" (22:16-17).
Rashi (22:12) quotes the midrash, giving God's answer when Abraham
questions Him about His apparent "change of mind" about the sacrifice:
" 'I will not violate My covenant, or change what I have uttered' [Psalms,
89:35]. When I told you, 'Take your son,' 'I will not. . . change what I
have uttered.' For I did not tell you, 'Slaughter him,' but 'Take him up.'
Now you have taken him up—take him down!"
The annihilation of meaning, inherent in the notion of a god who
contradicts himself, is here simply negated. Having acted in a universe of
enigma and contradiction—without insisting on resolutions—Abraham
is then invited to reconstrue the words of the past. In Ricoeur's terms, he
is to "assume another past," to constitute a "better continuation" of God
and of himself. The tension between continuity and discontinuity is
resolved only ultimately, and only in terms of denegation.
The expression, kime'atshelo nisbhat (he was all but slaughtered) also
yields the same model of denegation. Survival on such terms is for Sarah

132
HAYYEI SARAH
contingency and despair, the death of meaning. For her, restoration does
nothing to neutralize the terror.
"I did not say to the stock of Jacob, 'Seek Me out in a wasteland
[tobuY " (Isaiah 45:19). R. Hutner, in the same essay that we have  
discussed, analyzes the import of God's denegation. What it implies is that
there is a reality called Tohu—Nothingness. But the seed of Jacob  
represents a highly evolved form of consciousness that may transcend this
modality. Isaac, on the other hand, lives his life within the parameters of
the abyss, and survives for posterity as the realization of this possibility—
total nihilation, the burnt offering, the knowledge of "it would have been
better for man never to have been created."
This is the Tohu, the Nothingness of which Isaiah speaks, and which
ultimately he rejects (45:18): "He did not create it [the world] a waste
[tohu]\ but formed it for habitation." The absurdity, the inhuman waste of
a world of Tohu, ruled by the Greek "moira," the malevolent gods of fate,
necessity and silence, is countered by the denegation of lo tohu. Rashi's
comment spells out the existential force of this denegation; against the
meta-silence of Tohu—in which human acts are gratuitous, have no
effect—God gives the Torah, which is founded in the promise of justice.
"Great reward" is the affirmation at the heart of darkness.
The Torah given in the howling wasteland
At this point, we approach one of the radical forms of the paradox of
Nothingness. For, as Moses sings in his last song, the Torah was given in a
place of waste, frustration, and death: "He found him in a desert region,
in an empty howling waste [uve-tohuyelel]" (Deuteronomy 32:10). Rashi
comments: "the waste-land where jackals and ostriches howl — even there,
they were drawn after faith." Here are the Yelalot, the voice of waste and
absurdity, and here is the denegation, the "in spite of" that Ricoeur
describes. The passion to find God, and to be found by Him, leads human
beings "even there" —to the delirium, the inspiration that transcends
annihilation.
The Yelalot, the howlings, are described in the Talmud as the  
expression of intoxication. ("Wine is called Yayin, because it brings Yelalah —
howling—into the world"20—presumably, a reference to the onomato-
poetic aspect of the words.) The hollowing out experience of metasilence
is the necessary prelude to the words of Torah. Perhaps this is what the
midrash indicates in Sarah's cry: "Woe to the son of the drunken woman!"2!

Vertigo—The Residue of the Akedah 133
Sarah achieves the Yelalot of the Shofar, but she does not consummate
them. "Happy are the people who know the Teru yah; O Lord, they walk in
the light of Your presence." To know the broken vibrato of the Shofar is
to know "how to seduce the Creator with the Teru'ah."22 For the Shofar
represents the consummate paradox of the "very good" creation of Man,
apprehended through groans and wails.23 Involved in a world of negation,
all but lost in the wilderness, the human being has the possibility of
affirming and transcending.
Satan, who originally desired to abort the Akedah trial, ultimately has
all his plans undermined by the Shofar wail.24 Hoist with his own petard,
he is doomed to hear Sarah's wailing brought to its end. For the Shofar
evokes the mystical transcendence of Mount Sinai (Exodus 20:15). The
Shofar that wails there is described in Targum Jonathan as having the
power to revive the dead. For only the wails that issued from the land of
ashes can be modulated to signal an ambiguous reality, despair, and
redemption.
Oarah in Abraham's and Isaac's imagination
Sarah lo hispika—cannot persist to the end. For her anguish is just this: the
perception of the kime'atsbelo, of disruption, of the "obscure disturbance
of [her] whole being."25 The vertigo that overwhelms her is reflected in
midrashic accounts of the anxiety felt for her by Abraham and by Isaac. It
is interesting to notice that Sarah's death is a reality in the minds of both,
before it happens. The doubt, the dread of their lives is focused on her. As
Abraham raises his knife, Isaac begs: "Father, don't tell my mother when
she is standing at the edge of a pit or on a roof, lest she throw herself down
and die."26 In a clear vision of Sarah's vertigo and suicide, Isaac speaks out
of his own "anima," the Sarah-in-himself, who is a focus of doubt,
apprehension, suspense: the modality of shema, "lest she. . . ."
Abraham, likewise, fears her suicide when she finds out the truth. He
leaves with his son, "early in the morning"—sbema — "lest Sarah change
her mind about letting them go."27 He, too, is nervously aware of what
Sarah represents; she is a part of himself, the part he must evade, if he is to
reach Moriah.
The pervasive presence of Sarah in Isaac's imagination is poignantly
suggested in this midrash:

134
HAYYEI SARAH
Since Satan could achieve nothing with Abraham, he came to Isaac and
said, "Son of a miserable woman! He is going to slaughter you!" Isaac
replied, "I know." Satan said, "In that case, all your mother's concern
about Ishmael will have been for nothing, and your hated rival will
inherit in your place. Don't you feel how outrageous this is?" This is
like the adage: if poisonous words are not wholly absorbed, they are at
least pardy absorbed. For "Isaac said to his father, 'Father. . . .'" Why
"father," twice? To rouse his pity for him.28
What partially undermines Isaac's determination is not the direct
voice of self-pity, but the more insidious imagination of Sarah's survival
in a world from which he is absent. His pity for his mother, bereft on a
personal level, and also deprived of the intentionality of her life,  
abandoned to an absurd reversal of her hopes, is his access to a sense of his own
mortality. How can he make retroactive mockery of her entire perception
of the world, in which the conviction of "Isaac-not-Ishmael" is so fierce?
Isaac quails before this vision of Sarah, which is the acrid knowledge of
his own death:
By means of the horror-stricken feeling which comes upon me from
the silence of those who are absent and who will no longer respond, the
death of another pierces me as an injury to our communal existence;
death "touches" me; and in so far as I am also another for others and
ultimately for myself, I anticipate my future death as my eventual lack
of response to all the words of all men.29
Through Sarah, death "touches" Isaac, with an anguish which  
"acquires a sort of intensity that is more spiritual than biological."30 This
yirahy the spiritual anguish that has to do with the silence of those who are
absent, and the apprehension of that silence, attains a peculiar force in
Sarah's situation. For the vertigo, the suicidal potential that Abraham and
Isaac sense in her—and in the Sarah part of themselves—always was the
hazard implicit in a sensibility that tolerated no equivocation, that was
crystal-clear in its perceptions and decisions.
Oarah ys analytical vision
The Sarah who could tell Abraham with such clinical decisiveness: "Cast
out that slave woman and her son, for the son of that slave shall not share
in the inheritance with my son Isaac" —demonstrates not only inflexible

Vertigo—The Residue of the Akedah 135
will but an apparently lucid vision of reality that is hidden from the more
entangled emotions of Abraham: "The matter distressed Abraham gready,
for it concerned a son of his" (21:10-11). For God confirms her surgical
judgment. He tells Abraham not merely to obey Sarah but to accept her
vision of things—less confused and multifaceted than his.31 What she
sees is that these two brothers cannot possibly coexist; though they seem
to be playing together, there is murder in the wind.
Rashi cites the midrash that presents the game the boys are playing as
a kind of William Tell game, with Ishmael shooting arrows at Isaac and
then claiming, "But I'm only playing." Ishmael's injured innocence fools
Sarah not at all: in the phrase Rashi uses, "They would go out to the
field," are caught midrashic harmonics: the field is the world —"Let us
prospect our share of the field."32 There is a mortal struggle under way,
here, for a place in the sun; and Ishmael is deadly serious. What Sarah
sees is the uncompromising passion of the encounter. Ishmael may be
kimitlahleha (Rashi, 21:10),33 he himself may be unconscious of the forces
driving him, may really believe in the game. But that does not reduce the
necessity Sarah sees to separate the boys before the explosion occurs. For
what she sees is Cain and Abel in the field: "Cain said to his brother
Abel . . . and when they were in the field, Cain set upon his brother Abel
and killed him" (4:8). There, too, there was a strangled attempt at play, at
dialogue. But the reality overwhelms them, and murder enters the world.
In a cryptic poetic insight, Midrash Tanhuma portrays this analytic
capacity of Sarah. " 'She looks for wool and flax' [Proverbs 31:13]. This
refers to Sarah, who said, 'Cast out that slave-woman and her son.' "34
Sarah is praised for detecting the incompatible principles that animate
Isaac and Ishmael. (According to midrashic tradition, the dubious  
sacrifice that Cain brings to God is flax.35 And wool, of course, is associated
with Abel's work as shepherd.) In a phrase, the midrash thus suggests the
fratricidal potential of an apparently innocent relationship, and places in
relief Sarah's acuity in perceiving it.
But this very acuity, the laser beam that disentangles complexity and
cuts to the quick, makes Sarah vulnerable when all structures and  
certainties are undermined. In the vertigo of the kime'at shelo, pure thought can
no longer help her. Unlike Abraham, whose tendrils of concern involve
him with the complex life of those around him, and who is therefore
"gready distressed, for it concerned a son of his," Sarah aspires to an
analytical purity that yields her no refuge at the end. "Suicide," says

136
HAYYEI SARAH
Kierkegaard, "is the only tolerable existential consequence of pure
thought."
On this reading, Sarah dies of her life; or, to put it in Jung's terms, she
cannot meet the challenge of later life, which demands reversals, the
confrontation with counterpossibilities: "What was true in the morning
will at evening have become a lie."36 The clarity, the habitual gesture of
disentangling, which were characteristic of her, can offer her no joy now,
when she is suspended in a universe lacking in answerable questions
("Suspended in bli-ma" [Job 26:7] —in the Nothingness in which even
questions become absurd). In this metasilence, only the howl of negation
comes to her lips. Lo hispika — she cannot realign herself to complete the
howl and discover the difficult "very good," the painful prize of a full
humanity.
l\braham'>s involvement and conflict
Abraham's history charts a very different course. Entangled in the world,
linked by love with all who enter his many doors, he feels himself
incapable of the surgical removal of Ishmael that Sarah prescribes. But in
this she is right, God says. So he obeys, he submits to her voice. Yet the
irony of events leads him later, after Sarah's death, to take Hagar back;
according to midrashic tradition, Keturah, whom Abraham marries at the
end of his life, is identified with Hagar (25:1-6). In an obvious symbolic
reversal, Abraham reaffirms his life's urge to integrate and include. Yet,
even in this remarriage, there is a postmortem acknowledgment of
Sarah's legacy of discrimination and analysis. He gives presents to the
sons of his old age, but he sends them away from Isaac's presence.
Ultimately, he dies in the mode of bakol—"And the Lord had blessed
Abraham bakol [in all things]" (24:1). He is "full of days": in the reading
of Sefat Emet, this indicates a condition in which nothing is forgotten,
nothing censored. Bringing all his days with him, Abraham dies in accord
with God's prediction: "You shall go to your fathers in peace" (15:15).
According to Rashi, the reference to "your fathers" promises final  
reconciliation with all that he rejected at the outset of his life. God promises
also that Ishmael will be reconciled with Isaac, will acknowledge the
preter-natural order of their relationship.37
But there is a price to be paid for this idyll, the classical perfection of
Abraham's life, from which nothing has to be expunged, and where all

Vertigo—The Residue of the Akedah 137
complexities find their place. For this idyll does have limits: there is a dark
rim edging the sunlight. Abraham must die five years prematurely, in
order to preserve the harmony of his vision.38 Five more years, and he
would have seen Esau acting on impulses of his nature that would have
disrupted Abraham's peace. To speak of a diminishing of life for the sake
of protecting its coherence is to declare the limitation of what Abraham
can bear to see.
The point is made vividly in the midrash. The text in Genesis 25:11
reads: "After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac."
Not blessings but gifts Abraham gave Isaac. This is like a king who
owned an orchard and gave it to a tenant-farmer to tend. Two trees
grew there, entangled with one another: one grew vital potions, and
the other grew fatal poisons. The farmer said: "If I water the vital tree,
the fatal one will be nourished too. But if I don't water the fatal one,
how will the vital one live?" He concluded: "I am merely a tenant-
farmer, in temporary charge of the orchard. Let me finish my tenure,
and then let the owner decide what to do." So said Abraham: "If I bless
Isaac now, the sons of Ishmael and of Keturah will be included. And if I
don't bless them, how can I bless Isaac?" He concluded: "I am merely
flesh and blood—here today and tomorrow in the grave. I have already
done what I had to do [Rashi: "in giving birth to them all"]. From this
point on, let God do what He wishes in His world." When he died,
God revealed himself to Isaac and blessed him.39
The mystery at the heart of the midrash radiates from the strange
involvement of the trees with one another. Here, Abraham's vision of
things, his essential entanglement in life, that will not allow him the
analytical definitiveness of Sarah, rebounds against its own limitation. To
see opposites as viscerally connected with each other, in a complex
symbiosis that seems to admit of no separation, is to be overpowered by
"thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears." Abraham cannot cut the
trees apart; but at this point he cannot simply act on a principle of total
inclusiveness. He has given birth to the reality of conflicting principles;
only God can preside over the evolving conflict. To be a source of life is to
generate tensions that one cannot direct or control. At the point where
the essential tension of life grows beyond him, Abraham can only  
surrender his stewardship.
He was originally blessed, "You shall be a blessing" (12:2). In Rashi's
reading, this endowed him with the power to bless at will. But the current

138
HAYYEI SARAH
of connection fuses at the end of his life. In Rashi's words, "He was afraid
to bless" (25:11): he comes to his own form of vital anguish, the modality
of Isaac enters his soul, brings them together at the moment when
Abraham must hold back blessing from his son.
Isaac comforted after his mother
If we follow Isaac into the world after Sarah's death, we can detect the
veiled structure of a drama that begins with that death and ends with
Isaac's marriage and Abraham's remarriage and death, leaving his son
unblessed. The whole Parsha (23:1-25:18), a single Torah reading, is
titled, "The life of Sarah." The irony of such a naming is only too
apparent. For, in reality, the subject of the section is the question of
Sarah's life. The statement of the text—the serene, noncommittal  
numbering of her years — is undermined by the midrashic comment on the
cause of her death. Rashi himself reinforces the paradox: on the one hand,
all her years were "equal in goodness"; on the other, she dies oi"kime'at
sheloV The question of Sarah's life is Isaac's legacy: only he can unravel it,
though he cannot answer it.
Rashi says, on the intense ending of Isaac's marriage quest—"Isaac
brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he took Rebecca as his
wife. Isaac loved her, and thus found comfort after his mother's death."
(24:67)— "It is human nature that as long as a man's mother is still alive
[kayyemet], he is involved (entangled) with her; when she dies, he  
comforts himself in his wife."
Rashi is pointing a spotlight here on the issue of Isaac's entanglement
with his mother's life, her very kiyyum, the problem of her existence. The
existential anguish of her last moment, which, in one intuition of kime'at
shelo, retroactively confirms the contingency of a life and emerges in a
strangled wail — this is what Isaac is involved with. He is caught up in the
vertigo of her being. For Isaac, to be comforted is to free himself of this
fascination with his mother's pain, and to turn to his own life. Rashi often
explains the word, nehama, comfort or regret, as mahshava aheret, "a
different thought."40 The notion is that comfort and regret both imply a
shift in paradigms, allowing new questions, new anomalies, to remove
one from old preoccupations. In his reading, therefore, Isaac is freed
from his preoccupation with his mother's life; he is freed, essentially, for
new thoughts, a new way of thinking his existence.

Vertigo — The Residue of the Akedah 139
Isaac turns to his wife, to new dialectical struggles, "after" his mother.
In his relation with Rebecca, he finds a way of remembering Sarah; of
rearticulating the parts of his knowledge of her. The angst of her death is
healed in a relation in which Rebecca is both like and unlike his mother.
The Oedipal perception that Rashi clearly states ("It is human nature")
gains tragic resonance from the death theme.
According to one midrashic source, at least, Sarah has been dead three
years, when Isaac marries Rebecca, and what he needs comfort for is not
simply the fact of her death:
Three years Isaac mourned for his mother. Every time he entered her
tent, and saw it in darkness [dimmed], he would tear his hair. But when
he married Rebecca, and brought her into the tent, the light returned
to its place. "And Isaac brought her into the obel [the tent]": obelmeans
"light," as it is said, "Till the moon will no longer shine" [Job 25:5].
He was comforted and [lit.] saw it as though his mother were still in
existence. That is why it says: "Isaac was comforted after his mother."41
The implicit understanding behind the midrash is that Isaac does, in
reality, suffer a kind of death at the Akedah. His mother dies, and with her
the light of her tent. In an astonishing fusion of images, the tent of her
intimate life becomes the energy that affirms life. Light, claims the
midrash, is by definition the meaning of obel (tent). To have left one's tent
in darkness is to deny the value of being. The anguish of Isaac's reaction,
as he enters the condition of his mother's life, expresses a desperate
involvement in the wailing of her end. With Rebecca's coming, the
energy of hope returns, because he now can see his mother's life as
though she really had her Being. Through the prism of his relation with
Rebecca, his mother's existence, her kiyyum, becomes vital again.
The Akedah: the tragic residue
The healing relation with Rebecca, who is and is not Sarah,42 contains
elements that go much beyond the universal Oedipal model. For she
comes to resolve a complex tangle of dilemmas. In an obvious sense, as
she runs back and forth at the well, eagerly providing for the needs of the
servant and the camels, she resembles Abraham welcoming his angel-
guests43 — impatient, energetic, overflowing with love {hesed). For an
Isaac, withdrawn, haunted by the shadows in his mother's tent, she will

140
HAYYEI SARAH
re-evoke the hopeful involvement of an Abraham, connecting,  
integrating, generating life. But the need of Abraham's family for Rebecca goes
much further than that.
The servant prays for success in his mission, thanks God when success
seems imminent. But the motif-word that recurs rather strangely in his
prayers is the word, hesed (love): " 'Act in hesed with my master, Abraham'"
(24:12)." 'Through her, I shall know that You have acted in hesed with my
master.'" (24:14). "'Blessed be the Lord God of my master, Abraham,
who has not abandoned His hesed and His truth from my master'" (24:27)
(my translation).
The importance of what Rebecca will mean to the family is intimated
here. For there is, after all, a tragic residue of the Akedah in Abraham's
family. The darkening of Sarah's light is one manifestation. But even in
Abraham's case—what can it have meant to him to undergo the test, and
then simply, silently, to have Isaac restored to him? It is surely significant
that the call on Moriah, to refrain from sacrifice, comes from an "angel of
God," not from God Himself. God says not a word to Abraham after the
command to sacrifice his son. He restores his son, but Abraham never
knows the reason for his experience.
This is the inadequacy of hesed to human desire. In this mode of hesed,
in a world where God is silent, the status quo is apparently preserved.44
Nothing is illuminated by this hesed; God's role, His relation to human
action, reward, punishment—all the theological mysteries remain
intact.45
Moreover, the real problem is human recognition of hesed as hesed.
Implicit in the servant's prayers is the need to see a manifest indication of
God's hesed to Abraham. His main criterion for the Tightness of Rebecca's
election is that he will sense in her the hesed that, since the Akedah, has
been lacking from his master's experience. He prays to know, by means of
her rightness, that hesed is being done to his master;46 not merely that
God should be so kind as to make it happen that the girl he speaks to is the
right one. The hesed he asks for, in other words, is not a means, but an end
in itself.
Rebecca represents that essential hesed of which Midrash Rabbah says:
" 'Act in hesed to my master1: You began something—finish it! Everyone is
needy of hesed, even Abraham, for whose sake hesed charges the world,
even he is needy of hesed— as it is said, 'Act in hesed to my master,
Abraham'—You began something—finish it!"47

Vertigo—The Residue of the Akedah 141
The paradox of hesed is that it is gratuitous, free of necessity. It is given
at God's will, so that even Abraham cannot demand it as a right. But
without it, everything fails. The servant speaks of neediness; the  
knowledge of God's love is the energy that empowers even an Abraham to see
coherence in his life. "You began something—finish it!" Implicitly, the
servant begs, challenges: Do not withdraw that vital vision from my
master—though it is Your right, yet besedhzs a law of its own. To begin a
gift commits the giver to a new necessity of giving.
Abandonment and ingathering
Listening intently to the text, one can detect the tone of renewed hope,
the undertow of despair confronted, in the servant's gratitude: "Blessed
be the Lord God. . . . who has not abandoned His hesed from my master"
(24:27). Azov is the word for both "abandonment" and "binding  
together," "consolidation."48 Andre Neher writes: "Abandonment and
ingathering belong together, not because of the compensating healing
effect of the passage of time, but through the inner dialectic of their
inseparable relationship."49
Seeds have been scattered, all seemed fallen apart; but in the  
disintegration, the servant now recognizes not only the denegation of lo azav
(He has not abandoned), but the harmonic of affirmation, the promise of
a new equilibrium, a new emet to be initiated by Rebecca's entry into
Abraham's world. It is as though the metabolic balance of the family is
now to be readjusted.
jfivoting points
The kabbalah characterizes Jacob, born of the new balance, as emet—
perfect equilibrium, consolidation of extreme modalities, at a point where
the center will hold. In reality, and in terms of the contingencies of the
narrative, this emet is mediated by intense moments of kime'at shelo, by
the "all but" sense of risk and accident that had proved fatal to Sarah.
There are two such moments. The first is when the servant silently
observes Rebecca's lavishly enacted hesed. On one level, this moment is a
full corroboration of God's design, a literal replay of the test-scenario the
servant had scripted. Even on this level, however, since Rebecca's words

142
HAYYEI SARAH
and acts contain anomalies, the immaculate providentiality is subtly
shaded, even as it is affirmed.
This is how the Torah describes the servant's reaction: "The man,
meanwhile, stood gazing at her, silently wondering whether the Lord had
made his errand successful or not/' (24:21). The tension of the moment is
palpable: the redundant "or not" persuades us of the real anguish of
doubt and hope the servant experiences. Silence, tension, waiting for
clear knowledge — all the elements are condensed into the unusual word,
mishta 'eh. Rashi lists the gamut of nuances evoked by the word. It enfolds
a poetic range of meanings—not simply "surprised," or "waiting," but
"transfixed," "devastated," "confused," "dumb," "charged with thoughts."
Clearly, the condition of the servant is not entirely pleasurable. The
connotations of desert and silence evoke the vertigo we discussed earlier.
This is a moment of suspense, for much hangs on the event. The servant
sees Rebecca as Abraham come again. There is a sense of the prodigious
possibly about to happen (Rashi: "close to success"). What is at hazard is
the living knowledge oihesed that Abraham had brought to the world: the
moment is one of deepest reflection (even the grammatical form  
expresses this), spanning the poles of abandonment and recollection.50
The other moment of suspense occurs when Rebecca and Isaac first
meet: "Isaac went out walking [la-suah, to meditate] in the field toward
evening and, looking up, he saw camels approaching. Raising her eyes,
Rebecca saw Isaac. She alighted from the camel and said to the servant,
'Who is that man walking in the field toward us?' And the servant said,
'That is my master.' So she took her veil and covered herself" (24:63-65).
Isaac walks in the shadows of the falling night: his meditation is  
traditionally understood to be the prayer of the evening. For his thoughts since
the Akedah and Sarah's death are locked into questions of transition,
change, reversal. Rebecca sees him: how does she see him? This  
apparently is an important question, since Midrash Rabbah deals with it, and
Rashi quotes: "She saw him majestic, and she was dumbfounded in his
presence."51
The word used by the midrash, tohehy recalls one dimension of that
other moment of confusion, doubt, suspense. What Rebecca sees in Isaac
is the vital anguish at the heart of his prayers, a remoteness from the
sunlit world oihesed that she inhabits. Too abruptly, perhaps, she receives
the shock of his world. Nothing mediates, nothing explains him to her.

Vertigo—The Residue of the Akedah 143
"Who is that man," she asks, fascinated, alienated. What dialogue is
possible between two who have met in such a way?52
A fatal seepage of doubt and dread affects her, so that she can no longer
meet him in the full energy of her difference. She veils herself, obscures
her light. He takes her and she irradiates the darkness of his mother's
tent. She is, and is not, like his mother; through her, his sense of his
mother's existence is healed. But the originating moment of their union
is choreographed so that full dialogue will be impossible between them.
From this, deceptions, manipulations, maskings, will result— a strange
breeding ground for truth! In this new marriage, a new metabolic balance,
complex, containing its own seeds of failure and hope, is set up. The result is
a condition in which "the twins struggled within her" (25:22). Enmeshed,
entangled in her life, truth evolves from conflict and equivocation.

Sincerity and Authenticity
Jacob takes Esau's blessings
The dramatic and moral focus of this Parsha is the scene of deception, in
which Jacob "takes"1 from his blind father, Isaac, the blessing intended
for his brother, Esau. Both the Torah text and the midrashic tradition
have sharp criticism to level against Jacob for this act. Subtly, the  
narrative voice indicates the ironies of nemesis within Jacob's personal  
destiny—for instance, in the parallel deception that he has to suffer on his
own wedding night. His father-in-law, Laban, replaces his beloved bride,
Rachel, with her "hated" sister, Leah, and then ingenuously defends
himself with sardonic references to the rights of the firstborn: "It is not
the practice in our place to marry off the younger before the elder [lit., the
firstborn]" (Genesis 29:26). Outraged, Jacob confronts Leah in the
morning. The midrash puts ironic words into her mouth: "He said to her,
'Deceiver, daughter of a deceiver! Did I not call you Rachel and you
answered me?!' She replied, 'Is there a master without students? Did your
father not call you Esau and you answered him?!'"2
Similarly, on the larger scale of national history, the midrash registers
the bitter cries of Esau realizing he is supplanted ("he burst into wild and
bitter sobbing" [27:34]); these echo in the cries of the Jewish people on
the verge of destruction in the time of Haman: "Mordecai went through
the city, crying out loudly and bitterly" (Esther 4:1): "Anyone who says
that God overlooks misdoing will himself be overlooked. He is merely
long-suffering, but ultimately collects His dues. Jacob made Esau break
out into a cry just once, and where was he punished for it? In Shushan the
capital, as it says, 'And he cried out loudly and bitterly.' "3
There is a precise and painful attention paid to Jacob's acts. Nothing is
foregone or blurred. The cries of Esau cheated, deprived, resound through
144

Sincerity and Authenticity
145
history, till they issue in a new ferocious moment of impersonation, when
Jacob cries in exact mimicry of the voice of the betrayed Esau.
Morally, then, Jacob's deception is confronted without equivocation
or apologetics, both in the narrative itself and in the midrashic tradition.
And yet, there is a motif in the midrashic narrative in Bereshit Rabbah,
which complicates the issue. This is the motif of legal ratification. Three
times, the midrash returns to the same imagery, in an attempt to focus the
dramatic essence of the "taken" blessing.
The first occasion is at the very moment when Isaac, deeply shaken,
realizes he has been deceived: "Isaac was seized with very violent  
trembling. 'Who was it then,' he demanded, 'that hunted game and brought it
to me? And I ate of it all before you came and I blessed him; indeed, he is
blessed'" (27:33). The strangeness of that coda strikes every reader.
Instead of insisting on his unconsciousness at the time of blessing, instead
of withdrawing words of blessing extorted from him under false  
pretenses, Isaac tells his beloved, deprived son, Esau, "indeed, he is blessed."4 At
this point, the midrash comments: "A divorce bill is ratified only when it
is signed and sealed. So that you should not say, 'if Jacob had not deceived
his father, he would not have acquired the blessings,' the text emphasizes,
'Indeed, he is blessed.' "5
After the deception, Isaac himself unexpectedly ratifies the  
transaction. A dramatic event—the use of certain words called a "blessing" — has
transpired. Regardless of moral judgments in the narrative itself or by
generations of readers, that dramatic event is here ratified; it is given legal
validity in the consciously written "signature" of the agent.
An almost sensuous dimension to this validation is suggested in the
commentary of Seforno: "Who brought me venison to deceive mey and
nevertheless is to be blessed?" Isaac felt, as he blessed Jacob, that the
blessing had 'taken' in the one blessed, as is told of R. Hanina, when he
used to pray for the sick."
R. Hanina, according to the Babylonian Talmud in Berakhot 34b,
could tell if his prayer had been accepted, by its "fluency in his mouth."
The capacity to intuit whether a prayer or blessing has "worked" is not,
then, a prophetic gift (R. Hanina explicitly denies this) but a sense of haw
the words feel in the mouth. There is a fluency, an organic, almost improvi-
sational flow to the words of a prayer that is "accepted"; a prayer that is
rejected (lit., torn apart) lacks this sensed Tightness, this flow. On such a
reading, Isaac is compelled, in spite of the emotional demands of the

146
TOLEDOT
situation, to tell the truth about the transaction that is called "blessing."
His signature ratifies words that, for many reasons, he may have wanted
to gainsay.
The second occasion when the midrash uses the imagery of legal
ratification is when Isaac, in full consciousness, calls Jacob and gives him
the "blessing of Abraham": "And Isaac called Jacob and he blessed
him. . . . 'May Almighty God bless you, make you fertile and numerous,
so that you become an assembly of peoples. May He grant the blessing of
Abraham to you and your offspring, that you may possess the land where
you are sojourning, which God assigned to Abraham'" (28:1, 3-4).
Isaac's "call" signifies the ritual, legal transmission of blessing.6 The
midrash identifies the essential heritage of the "blessing of Abraham"
with the misappropriated blessings, "taken" by Jacob:
The blessings were dubious [mefukpak, weak, contested, loose,
unraveled] in Jacob's hand. Where were they confirmed [nitoshashu, given
solid foundations] in his hand? Here—"And Isaac called Jacob. . . ."
Said R. Eliezer, "A divorce bill is ratified only when it is signed and
sealed. So that you should not say, 'if Jacob had not deceived his father,
he would not have taken the blessings,' the narrative says, 'And Isaac
called Jacob and he blessed him.' "7
The imagery of ratification is reinforced here by the dual perspective
on the blessings—at first, weakly held by Jacob, his grasp enervated — but
then given secure foundations, grasped firmly. What is described is,
apparently, a process of increasing reality, as the blessings become Jacob's,
and as all questioning of that reality is gradually blocked.
The third stage of the process is the point in the narrative when Jacob
returns after twenty years' absence and confronts his brother for the first
time. Clearly apprehensive of the meeting, he lavishes presents on Esau,
who replies, "My brother, let what is yours remain yours" (33:9). Here,
again, the midrash detects a moment of ratification:
The blessings were tenuously held in Jacob's hand. When were they
confirmed? Here—Esau said, "My brother, let what is yours remain
yours." Said R. Eliezer, "A divorce bill is ratified only when it is signed
and sealed. So you should not say, 'if Jacob had not deceived his father,
he would not have taken the blessings,' the narrative says, 'My brother,
let what is yours remain yours.'"8

Sincerity and Authenticity
147
Here, in a dramatic climax to the midrashic treatment of Jacob's
gradual consolidation of his hold on the blessings, Esau himself cedes the
reality of what is Jacob's. Rashi marks a similar moment of retroactive
acknowledgment, when, on the previous night, Jacob meets the  
mysterious "man," who wrestles with him until dawn. "Then he said, 'Let me
go, for dawn is breaking.' But he answered, 'I will not let you go, unless
you bless me'" (32:27). Rashi comments: " 'Acknowledge my right to the
blessings that my father gave me.' For Esau questioned his right to
them."9
Rashi is expressing Jacob's need for a new retroactive understanding of
the rightful resentments and angers of the past. When Esau "questions"
his right to the blessings, the word used, me'ar'er, suggests a legally valid
attempt to undermine Jacob's claim. In Rashi's reading, the "man," who is
midrashically identified with "Esau's guardian angel," " 'blessed him
there' — against his will, he acknowledged Jacob's right to the blessings"
(32:30).
Rashi is indicating a basic tension between Esau's valid grounds of
complaint (Rashi even seems to suggest, by his use of the present tense,
that this resentment, and the tension it induces, continues to the present
day) and his yielding acknowledgment of Jacob's claim to the blessings.
Why, indeed, one must ask, does Esau withdraw from this legal contest?
In the midrashic reading, what has changed, what is the process of
confirmation, by which the blessings become Jacob's, over a period of
time, and are attested to even by those most involved in—and most
injured by—the original deception?
"A, a trickster": The problem of voice
At this point, we can look more closely at the narrative itself. When
Rebecca presses Jacob to go to his father, in place of Esau, it is striking
that nowhere, at first formulation of the plan, does she refer to  
impersonation or deception. Jacob is simply to bring his father delicacies, "such
as he loves ... in order that he may bless you before he dies" (27:10).
The plan follows her account of Isaac's instructions to Esau. Jacob
protests: "But my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am smooth-skinned.
If my father touches me, I shall appear to him as a trickster and bring
upon myself a curse, not a blessing" (27:11-12).

148
TOLEDOT
The heart of his protest is the strange phrase, "I shall appear to him as
a trickster ." Jacob is afraid of looking like a dissembler to his father's blind
eyes. The question of deception is thus introduced by Jacob as a question
of his father's perception of him, rather than as an objective description of
Jacob's behavior. The result of this perception will be a curse instead of a
blessing. Rebecca counters, "Your curse, my son, be upon me!" and
repeats her instructions in condensed form. He fulfills these to the letter:
"And he went and he took and he brought" (27:14) and she prepares the
food, exactly as she has told him she will: "And his mother prepared a dish
such as his father loved." But then follows the description of how she takes
Esau's clothes and the skins of the slaughtered kids and uses them to
cover Jacob's body, to costume him for his role. Only then, after this act of
deception, of which there had been no explicit talk beforehand, does she
return to her original scenario, which focuses entirely on the preparation
and serving of food to Isaac.
Jacob, it appears, shrinks from the plan, not on objective moral
grounds but because his father will perceive —or misperceive—him as a
certain kind of person, ke-metateia, as a trickster. It is possible that, as
Nahum Sarna suggests,10 in the historical period of the narrative, the
"successful application of shrewd opportunism was highly respected."
Jacob, therefore, expresses revulsion at the idea that his father might see
him as a kind of slick careerist, however unobjectionable such a role might
be in contemporary terms.
What is most striking is that Jacob is the first person to bring up the
question of deception, which enters as a physical part of the preparations
only after he has spoken (27:15-16). Inevitably, if his father touches him,
he will be unmasked; he, therefore, is not referring to any disguise of his
smoothness when he fears that his father will see him "as a trickster." It is
some other act of impersonation, inherent in the original scenario, that
he fears will affect his father's vision of him.
To be "like a trickster" has, then, a very specific reference — not to the
quasi-burlesque stage business of goatskins and costumes, but to the act
of imitating Esaus voice. Ramban is troubled by the fact that Jacob never
refers specifically to the problem of his voice. The voice is, after all, the
central expression of identity, and the sensitivity to voices is a measure of
human wisdom. Why, then, is Jacob not apprehensive that his father will
simply recognize his voice? Ramban suggests two answers. Either the
brothers had very similar voices—which would account for the Sages'

Sincerity and Authenticity
149
interpretation of Isaac's statement, "The voice is the voice of Jacob," as
referring to the style and tone of Jacob's speech, rather than to the
physical timbre of his voice. Or he changed his voice, to imitate his
brother, "for there are people who know how to do that."11
If we explore the implications of Ramban's second suggestion, we find,
for instance, a statement in the Talmud that clearly understands the
"trickster" character as a matter of voice imitation: "Anyone who changes
his way of speaking is like one who worships idols—because in one place it
is written, 'I shall be like a dissembler [ke-metateia] in his eyes,' and in
another place, 'They [idols] are delusion, a work of mockery [ta'atuim]9"
(Jeremiah 10:15).12
A startling equation is set up between vocal mimicry, the assumption
of inauthentic speech patterns, and idolatry. The premise of the Talmud
here is that metateia, "dissembler," refers specifically to such a change of
voice: Jacob fears that his father will perceive him as manipulating his
voice to assume Esau's identity. This the Talmud identifies, without
elaboration, with idol worship. One must wonder what was the Sages'
sensibility to the voice and its relation to personal identity. Jacob recoils
from being perceived as a mimic: a curse is perceived by him as an
inevitable consequence of offending against such a radical taboo. What
are the implications of assuming the voice of another? Possibly, Rebecca's
response — costuming Jacob in animal skins — is a way of partially allaying
his anxiety: such a crass imitation of Esau's physical identity will distract
his father from concentrating on the question of voice.
Lo thine awn self be true"
The concept of metateia invites further exploration. The word occurs
again in II Chronicles 36:16: "They mocked the messengers of God."
The meaning of "mockery," rather than "deception," is important, and
is clearly supported by the Targums' translation of the word in our
context. Targum Jonathan translates ki-megahekh—xhe same word he
uses to translate the description of Lot: "he seemed to his sons-in-law as
one who jests" (19:14). Implicitly, what Jacob dreads is not being found
out, but being perceived by his father as "one who jests," as  
fundamentally unserious about his relation to his father and, essentially, to himself.
To play with an assumed identity—by changing his voice —is to risk his
father's Tzmperception, for he feels himself to be merely like a mocker.

150
TOLEDOT
Appearance and reality produce multiple distorted inter-reflections; in
playing the role of his brother, Jacob risks having his own authentic
reality misunderstood; in order to buffer him against such a caricature
role, Rebecca must dress him in the gross skins of slaughtered animals.
The most serious issues are at stake. The midrash on Proverbs, for
example, asserts: "A scholar who neglects the word of Torah is like one
who makes mockery [ki-metateia] of the One who spoke and the world
was created."13 To neglect that which is most essential to one's authentic
being—in this case, the responsibility of the scholar to his text—is a
criminal act of not taking God seriously. The notion of metateia,  
therefore, is implicated in the question of gravity, of the "heaviness," the
seriousness of being. To jest with this, to play with one's voice, is to
disrupt one's access to God-in-the-world. It is to be guilty of a kind of
frivolity that dissociates one from others, from continuities and larger
purposes. "To thine own self be true," pontificates Polonius, ". . . Thou
canst not then be false to any man."14 To abandon one's individuated
selfhood, to trifle with the voices of others, is ultimately to undermine
not only the differences, but the connections, between people.
Truth to self is not, however, a simple concept. Rashi introduces his
commentary to this Parsha, that deals with role-playing and deception,
with an extraordinary—and classic—passage. The Torah text begins:
"This is the story of Isaac, son of Abraham. Abraham begot Isaac"
(25:19). Rashi accounts for the redundancy:
Since the text has just said, "Isaac, son of Abraham," does it have to
add, "Abraham begot Isaac"? But the mockers of the generation were
saying, "Sarah conceived from Avimelekh—she lived with Abraham
for many years without conceiving." What did God do? He formed
Isaac's facial features like Abraham's, so that everyone testified,
"Abraham begot Isaac."
Rashi, drawing on the midrash, focuses the basic problems of paternity
and identity. In this one extraordinary case, all the ambiguities—legal
and empirical—surrounding the question of paternity are swept aside by
the "ocular proof." What can never be conclusively proven—before the
age of blood and tissue tests, at any rate—becomes a matter of general
consensus: God creates an overwhelming likeness between father and
son, whom the mockers so plausibly threaten to dissociate from each
other. The knowing laughter of the mockers denies the connection

Sincerity and Authenticity
151
between father and son; to accept this ironic view is to yield to the  
unbearable lightness of being, to allow appearances to dominate perception.15
And yet, God Himself acknowledges the force of the ironic view. In
one of Rashi's sources,16 Isaac's weaning feast is planned to prove to "all
the nations of the world" that Sarah is indeed the baby's natural mother:
she nurses all the aristocratic infants who are brought to the feast,
without nurses, in order to test her. In spite of this, the mockers are not
silenced: "Immediately, Isaac's facial features were transformed, and  
resembled Abraham's; everyone cried out, 'Abraham begot Isaac!'"
In this source, God's manipulation of Isaac's appearance is delayed
from the fetal stage to his weaning day (at age three). The delay focuses
the theme of change, of manipulation of the material. Isaac startlingly
emerges from this midrashic description as the wearer of a life-long mask.
His unequivocal resemblance to Abraham is intended to make a point
about connection and continuity. But, in order to make that point, Isaac
has to wear Abraham's face, even as he evolves an identity that in every
empirical aspect is clearly very different from Abraham's. God makes the
change "for the sake of peace."17 He is prepared to equivocate, whether
verbally (by misquoting Sarah's disparaging thoughts about her  
husband's age, "Now that I am withered, am I to have enjoyment—with my
husband so old" [18:22]) or in terms of flesh—by changing Isaac's
appearance, "for the sake of peace," for the sake of wholeness, to silence
the ironic voices of the fragmenters.
Great is peace, for the Torah speaks fictions for the sake of peace. . . .
When the nations of the world said, "Can a hundred-year-old man
procreate? She must have conceived from Avimelekh or Pharaoh!,"
there was suspicion in Abraham's heart about this. What did God do?
He told the angel in charge of the embryo, "Make him exacdy like
Abraham, so that everyone will testify that he is Abraham's son.". . .
Everyone who saw Abraham said, "Obviously, Abraham begot Isaac."18
God prepares visual evidence to counteract the plausible, destructive
suspicions of Abraham himself. In the world of appearances, the real
nature of things is often thoroughly masked; there is testimony and
countertestimony; not even Abraham is exempt from the turbulent  
processes of interpretation.19 But here, for once, God intervenes to prevent
disintegration and skepticism; in order to do this, however, He has Isaac
masquerade in a face whose simple affirmations run counter to the

152
TOLEDOT
differences that are basic to his being. He lives and explores his truth—his
discontinuity from his father—while wearing a mask that proclaims  
continuity and resemblance.
Isaac: The terror of weightlessness
The question of change, of masking for serious—as opposed to frivolous
or disintegrative — purposes, arises with full force in the drama of Jacob's
deception of his father. Jacob's dread of seeming "like a dissembler," with
its emphasis on a frivolous, disparaging attitude to the fixities and  
harmonious connections of self and world, is apparently realized when Isaac
discovers that he has been deceived. He is "seized with a very violent
trembling." Isaac's anxiety is explained by Rashi as a terror at precisely
this kind of change in the basic stabilities and relationships of the family
structure (27:36):
Why was Isaac afraid? He said, "Perhaps I have sinned in blessing the
younger before the older. I have changed the order of relationships When
Esau cried out, "He has supplanted me twice," Isaac asked, "What did
he do to you?" and Esau answered, "He took my birthright." Then
Isaac said, "That is what I was anxious about—that I had crossed the
straight line of law. Now I realize that I did give my blessing to the
firstborn!"
For Isaac, the idea of breaching the given structures is anathema. The
"order of relationships," the "straight line of law" —the differences and
hierarchies inherent in all structures—are sacred for him. Without them,
"chaos is come again." Or, as the midrash puts it, "he saw gehinnom, the
abyss, open beneath him" (Rashi, 27:33). The idea of disguise provokes
profound anxiety about the weightiness of things. Nietzsche dreaded the
"weightlessness of all things"; perhaps the fascination and fear that the
masquerade often arouses registers some profound apprehension about
the inauthenticity of all experience. To play the "change" game with skin
and voice is to equivocate about that central strength that Rousseau calls
the "sentiment of being."20
And yet, as we have suggested, it is precisely the voice game, in which
identity is most radically compromised, that is basic to Jacob's concept of
the masquerade. It is because he is to imitate Esau's voice that he may fall
foul of Isaac's terror of weightlessness.

Sincerity and Authenticity
153
Indeed, the midrash offers a startling reading of Isaac's gnomic  
assessment of the unseen son standing in front of him: "Jacob drew close to his
father Isaac, who felt him and said, 'The voice is the voice of Jacob, yet the
hands are the hands of Esau'" (27:22). This is commonly understood as
expressing the conflicting evidence presented to Isaac's senses by Jacob's
voice, on the one hand, and hairy Esau-like goatskins, on the other. The
midrash, however, offers this reading: "The voice is of a wise man, while
the hands have been skinning corpses,"21 A super-commentary reads:
"The voice is one of indirection and cunning—because Jacob slyly
changed his voice to that of Esau."22
The "voice of Jacob" is read as the voice of cunning and  
transformation (the name "Jacob" derives from the root akov — crooked, indirect), so
that the midrashic reference to a "wise man" is similarly understood as
meaning the cunning play with voices. "The hands of Esau" is read as
referring to Jacob's bands that have completed their task ("Esau" is
misread assoo—"they have completed") of skinning the animals and
covering themselves with the skins.
Such a reading implies that Isaac's sense of the unseen son in front of
him is not conflicted. Isaac hears Jacob imitating Esau's voice and senses
him as wearing a burlesque costume of animal pelts, simulating Esau's
skin. That is, on this understanding, the full hybrid role-playing quality
of Jacob's project is perceived by Isaac. And yet—astonishingly—"he
blessed him" (27:3). And later, as he shakes with anxiety as the fitnesses
and fixities of proper relationship gape apart, he confirms the blessing—
"And indeed he is blessed" (27:33).
Impersonation and authenticity
Profound paradoxes of impersonation and authenticity are mobilized in
this scene. Lionel Trilling begins his classic study, Sincerity andAutben-
ticity, with an anachronistic application of the term "sincerity": "We
cannot say of the patriarch Abraham that he was a sincere man. That
statement must seem only comical. The sincerity of Achilles or Beowulf
cannot be discussed: they neither have nor lack sincerity."23 A concept
suitable to a discussion of Werther or of Marianne Dashwood is, Trilling
claims, evidently irrelevant to ancient literary texts. However, to focus on
the question of Jacob's sincerity would not, I suggest, be at all comical. It

154
TOLEDOT
might, indeed, go some way to addressing the same issues that loom large
in the midrashic tradition.
Jacob is first introduced as a simple, naif man (ish tarn — 25:27); Rashi
comments: "Inexpert at hunting; his words reflect his inner meaning.
One who is not sharp at deceiving is called tarn—naif, sincere." This is
the man who fears seeming "like a dissembler"; and who then  
impersonates his brother, not merely by hanging animal pelts over his flesh, but
by the subtle mimicries of voice. As we have seen, according to one
reading, at least, Isaac in fact recognizes this as Jacob's special talent. And
yet the Talmud in Sanhedrin24 equates this with idolatry, with a  
fundamental inauthenticity, an unseriousness about the coherence and  
continuity of identity. In this act of impersonation, indeed, are focused
the powerful tensions that Trilling analyzes in his study of sincerity
and authenticity.
By deploying texts from Diderot, Hegel, and Shakespeare, Trilling
proposes to us the "dismaying thought that sincerity is undeserving of
our respect." The disintegrated, alienated, and distraught  
consciousness—which Hegel calls "base" — represents a higher mode of freedom
than that of the "honest soul," the condition of "nobility," which is
committed to accord with the external power of society. To detach
oneself from imposed conditions, from the roles assigned by birth and
social rank, is to lose one's self, but thereby to gain access to a new
authenticity of self.
Trilling uses Hegel's paradoxical analysis of the "honest soul" and the
"disintegrated consciousness" as the basis for his study of the historical
movement from the admiration of "sincerity" to that of "authenticity."25
I should like to use this model to suggest a reading of Jacob's entry into
the world of "authenticity," the world in which he will look "like a
dissembler," and leave behind him his primary sense of himself as ish tarn,
a "sincere," "noble" man. Like Hegel's heroic individual, Jacob must
become "base," alienated, a player of many roles, before he can redefine,
in his life, the meaning of "nobility." A kind of freedom has to become
his, before he can indeed to his "own self be true." He must enter the
world of seeming, of enactment, of performance, in which authenticity
can be defined only retroactively.26
The hazards of such a world are palpable. It is much simpler and safer
to remain "sincere"; but Jacob risks entry into the world of ambiguities,
equivocations, mimicries. This is, properly, Esau's world, of hunting,

Sincerity and Authenticity
155
tracking, "transformations'' of the human-animal margins.27 Here one
becomes whatever one has to become, in order to eat and to feed others.
An increasingly complex notion of the "self" becomes Jacob's, as he puts
on the costumes, the skin of Esau. The bafflement of the narrative is that,
even as he imitates Esau's voice, Isaac recognizes the Jacob-voice of
mimicry and, spontaneously, blesses him. Isaac—in whom any  
obliteration of limits and distinctions rouses profound anxiety—is yet moved
both to bless the masquerading Jacob and, later, in full possession of the
facts, in a new cognition of reason and order, to confirm that blessing.
Isaac's blindness: after-image of the Akedah
In order to set the enigma of Isaac's blessing in context, it will be helpful,
at this point, to explore some dimensions of the "family dynamics" that
underlie Jacob's performance and Isaac's response to it. The drama of
deception begins with a reference to Isaac's blindness: "When Isaac was
old and his eyes were too dim to see" (27:1). Even though the text itself
clearly explains the cause of Isaac's blindness, Rashi nevertheless offers
three comments:
"His eyes were too dim to see": Because of the smoke of these  
daughters-in-law, who were offering incense to idols. Another explanation:
When Isaac was bound on the altar and his father wanted to slaughter
him, at that moment, the heavens opened up and the ministering
angels saw and wept, and their tears came down and fell into his eyes;
therefore, his eyes dimmed. Another explanation: so that Jacob should
take the blessings.
Rashi's first explanation has the virtue of interpreting Isaac's blindness
in its context. The previous verse had spoken of Esau's wives, who were "a
source of bitterness to Isaac and Rebecca." The anger and frustration
caused by their daughters-in-law, with their alien culture, essentially fogs
Isaac's perception. In the Tanhuma narrative, God brings blindness on
Isaac, as a defense mechanism against the frustration of what he has to
witness in his household—the absence of the Shehina, the hollowness of a
house without God. On this view, a kind of artificial peace cocoons the
sightless Isaac.28
The third explanation has a utilitarian thrust; there is a sense of
"God's plot" —for the narrative to work, for Jacob to get the blessings,

156
TOLEDOT
Isaac must be blind. As Rashi's first explanation accounted for the  
continuity of the narrative preceding Isaac's blindness, so this third  
explanation accounts for the continuity of the following narrative. Moreover,
from the point of view of Jacob's inner development, one might say that
the process called "Jacob's taking of the blessings" would never have been
launched if Isaac had not been blind and therefore obliged to "know"
Jacob by other means. This is the dimension of the deception scene that
I will explore at a later point.
It is, however, Rashi's second explanation that is most fascinating,
precisely because of its anomalousness. Suddenly, out of context, Rashi
refers to the Akedah—the "almost sacrifice" known as the Binding of
Isaac. Rashi cites the midrash: as Isaac lay on the altar, he looked up, the
angels looked down—their glances met, in the form of blinding tears. Is
there some suggestion of Use majeste here} Does Isaac probe the heavens
with a too-scorching gaze? Is there a decree that his "windows be sealed
up,"29 to maintain the human boundaries of vision?
What remains opaque, however, is the relevance of the Akedah  
experience to the present narrative. Possibly, Rashi indicates, by including this
midrashic etiology of blindness, that everything in Isaac's life experience,
his entire "sentiment of being," is shaped by the Akedah. Without the
Akedah, Rashi implies, we understand nothing of Isaac. And this remains
true, despite —or perhaps just because of—the fact that nowhere is the
Akedah moment ever referred to explicitly, after the event. Midrashic
readings of the post-Akedah narrative, however, are full of intimated
repercussions and connections, linking it through indirect, subterranean
channels to subsequent events.
If we look at Rashi's source, indeed, a detail emerges that significantly
colors our understanding of the blinding effects of the Akedah:30
"Isaac's eyes became dimmed from seeing" [literal translation of the
word me-re'ot]: from the impact of that vision. For when Abraham
bound his son on the altar, the ministering angels cried, as it is written,
"Hark, the Arielites cry aloud" [Isaiah 33:7]. And tears dropped from
their eyes into his eyes, and were imprinted into his eyes. And when he
became old, his eyes became dimmed, from seeing.
The midrash is finely articulated to respond to the internal tension of
the verse: Isaac's blindness spans the gap between old age and the vision
of the boy bound on the altar. What Isaac experienced in his youth,

Sincerity and Authenticity
157
helplessly shackled, his eyes alone free to pierce the heavens, is  
"imprinted" forever on those eyes. The Akedah leaves in him an after-image,
a kind of inverted residue, which only in old age assumes its original
blinding quality.
What the midrash suggests is that Isaacs blindness is a delayed
reaction to the Akedah—"when he became old." Survivor of unbearable
trauma, he lives an apparently successful life. He is wealthy and  
respected, the only one of the patriarchs to be called "great" three times in
one verse: "And the man became great, and he became greater until he
was very great" (26:13). He is an object of jealousy to the Philistines. His
men reopen the old blocked wells of his father's digging and then  
discover more wells. They acquire "breadth" and "fruitfulness" (26:22).
Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, is compelled to make a treaty with
him. But after a lifetime of achievement, the deep imprint of the
Akedah develops and the whole world falls into darkness.
In recent times, we have become painfully familiar with the notion of a
response to trauma that is delayed, repressed, and that emerges in  
psychosomatic dysfunction. One example is the phenomenon of blindness
afflicting women survivors of the Cambodian massacres. A considerable
time after the Khmer Rouge horrors, and after they had found refuge in
the United States, women began to complain of eyesight problems. No
organic disorder was diagnosed, and existing diagnostic categories — such
as Freud's hysterical blindness, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder—did
not entirely fit. What the women had seen, years earlier, had made it
necessary to suppress vision, to repress emotional response.
Just such a repression is, I suggest, implicit in the notion of Isaacs
delayed blindness. He is a man whose "ashes were as though heaped on
the altar,"31 as the midrash so paradoxically describes the after-effects of
the Akedah. After such ashes, what fire? Imprinted deep in Isaac's
consciousness is the spectacle, wept by angels, of his own death. In old
age, the vision explodes in fatal bloom: his awareness of death fills every
moment of life. "Look, now, I am old, and I don't know the day of my
death. ... let me bless you, before I die" (27:2, 4). Death haunts his
imagination, the angst of one who saw nothing else in an eternal moment
of his youth. (Isaac in fact lives sixty years after this "death bed" speech!)
The Midrash Tanhuma offers a powerful reading of the blindness
motif:

158
TOLEDOT
You find that one who is blinded is like the dead. Said R. Shimeon bar
Yohai, God does not generally associate His name with the righteous,
in their lifetime, but only after death, as it is said, "As to the holy ones
who are in the land" [Psalms 16:3] —When are they holy? When they
are buried in the ground ["in the land"]. As long as they are alive, God
does not associate His name with them—for He does not believe in
them that the Evil Impulse will not still mislead them. Only when they
are dead, God associates His name with them. And yet, we find that
God associates His name with Isaac, in his lifetime—as He says to Jacob,
"I am the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac" (28:13).
There are two understandings of this. The Rabbis say, "He saw Isaac's
ashes as though they were heaped on the altar." R. Berakhya says,
"Since he was blinded, he was, as it were, dead—because he was  
secluded in his house, and the Evil Impulse ceased troubling him."32
To be alive in the world, interacting with others, with the fall use of
one's senses, is to be volatile, conflicted, exposed to radical  
transformations. God does not attach His name to those who are still in the process
of becoming] only after they are "buried in the ground," when their life is a
fait accompli, does God describe them as belonging to Him. Isaac is the
one exception to this rule, but he lives, indeed, a kind of death-in-life,
passionless. He has abandoned the vital field, where costumes are worn,
and appearances make strident claims on belief. "Off, off, you lendings."
If this is holiness, it is a chill, bare recognition of "the thing itself": "Is
man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk,
the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. . . . Thou art
the thing itself; unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare,
forked animal as thou art."33
xsaacs family: victims of the Akedah?
There are two symbols for Isaac, the survivor—the ashes of the Akedah,
and the constricted lifespan of a blind old man. Hauntingly, the Bereshit
Rabbah midrash links the two images: the survivor of the Akedah ashes
may perform a life of vitality, but the truth of the Akedah impress
ultimately effaces all the gestures and costumings of the world.
Isaac marries and has two children; but nothing in his life is uncolored
by the Akedah experience. Rebecca, whose loving alacrity and energy are
reminiscent of Abraham's, meets Isaac in the field, and her whole body

Sincerity and Authenticity
159
falls, she veils herself, before the otherworldliness of an Isaac, rapt in
34
prayer.
A fatal seepage of Isaac's ashen being ultimately changes her: the girl
who said, unhesitatingly—in response to her family's demoralizing doubts,
"Will you go with this man?" — "I will go" (24:58)35 becomes the woman
who questions, time and time again, the value of her life. Her visceral
reaction to her daughters-in-law is a kind of revulsion: "I am disgusted
with my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries a Hittite
woman . . . what good will life be to me?" (27:46). The "Why life?"
question—this is the literal form in the original Hebrew—strikes a new
note in the biblical register. She is the philosopher who interrogates life,
harshly, skeptically—puts life to the question.
Most striking in this vein, however, is her enigmatic cry, as the infants
"struggle" in her womb: "If so, why do I exist?" (25:22). The "Why?"
question, here, too, is a bare, rudimentary three-word riddle: Lama zeb
anokhi— "Why—this — I am?" Rashi amplifies the question: "Why did I
desire and pray for pregnancy (if the pain is so great)?" Perhaps Rashi is
responding to the anokhi ("I am"), as the unitary sense of identity,
tormented by the conflict of her pregnant state.
Ramban finds Rashi's amplification not sufficiently grounded in the
words of the text. Instead, he emphasizes the central importance of the
word anokhi: "If this is to be my fate, why am I in the world? I wish that
I were not, that I would die, or never have had being, as Job said,
'Better . . . had I been as though I never was'" (Job 10:19).
Ramban reads Rebecca's question as a radical challenge to being.
Rebecca-as-Job strips the "I am" consciousness of all value. Such a
nihilistic protest at the pain and conflict that the self must endure is, for
Ramban, the first urge to prayer — "And she went to inquire of the Lord"
(25:22). ButMaharal, responding to Ramban's reading, expresses some
dismay at its existential skepticism. He suggests a modulated translation
of anokhi: "'Why then am I sitting passively [batel], why do I not
investigate? It is my task to seek out explanations.' — 'And she went to
seek God.'"
In Maharal's reading, Rebecca confronts the despair of the self, and
discovers that the question of meaning has a dynamic force. Her despair is
not to circle hollowly upon itself, but to launch searchings and research-
ings, inquiries for God. For Ramban, angst sends Rebecca into an  
encounter with God. For Maharal, the questioning itself is a mode of quest.

The self—the sense of "I am" —is threatened by lassitude, by vacancy, by
the dearth of given meanings. What is called the batel experience —
leisured, passive, bored, empty, unoccupied, in the dual sense —must be
counteracted by an energy generated by absence and longing.
In a family radically shaped by the Akedah experience, Esau can
perhaps be seen as the real victim of the sacrifice. In midrashic treatments
of the narrative, Esau emerges as the "presenting patient" of the family,
to borrow a term from family therapy analyses. In him, an underlying
pathology is clinically expressed. For example, in the cooking scene,
when he sells his birthright to Jacob for a lentil stew, he disparages the
rights and privileges he is relinquishing: "I am going to die, so of what use
is my birthright to me?" (25:32). In the Hebrew original, the "Why?"
question appears again (lit., Why to me the birthright?). When he is
faced with the brute fact of mortality—"I am going to die" —Esau
questions the structures, the very language of his culture. This is, in fact,
how Bereshit Rabbah reads Esau's question—not merely as a figurative
expostulation—"I am starved to death; of what use is my birthright?":
Esau asked Jacob: "What is the stew for?" Jacob answered: "That old
man [Abraham] has died." Esau said: "That old man has been struck
down by fate!?" He answered: "Yes." Esau then said, "If so, there is no
reward, and no resurrection of the dead." The Holy Spirit cried out,
" 'Do not cry for the dead and do not lament for them' — this refers to
Abraham; 'Weep rather for him who is going' [Jeremiah 22:10] — this
refers to Esau."36
Abraham, who has died, is not pitiable, in the view of the midrash.
Esau, who is "going" toward death, whose mortality obsesses him, is the
true object of compassion. The midrash isolates the word, holekh—
"going" — in Esau's cry: his life is filled with the imminence of death, and
all cultural forms and privileges lose substance under that shadow. For
Esau, Abraham has been the test case for meaning in absurdity. If he too
is subject to the fatality of death, then Esau abandons all belief in an
ultimately intelligible reality. In the narrative of the midrash, Esau seems
to fall instant prey to existential ennui; but this is clearly the clinching
moment of a long process. The question underlying the scene is the
question of anokhi—"I am": If the self—the sense of "I am" —is going to
die, then of what use are all the myths of religion and civilization? Early in
his career, Esau has abandoned an essential quest, surrendered an essen-

161
tial energy of being. He begs to "gulp down that red sX\iH,forIam tired"
(25:30). Literally, the anokhi—the sense of "I am" —is weary.37
Esau's ennui is prefaced by the innocuous phrase, "And Esau came in
from the field" (25:29). The field, however, is Esau's essential place, his
heraldic emblem. In the midrashic glossary, it becomes a code word for
his situation. The first adult description of him is, "A skillful hunter, a
man of the field" (25:27); Rashi comments, "'A man of the field': A
vacant man [batel\y hunting wild animals and birds with his bow." It is
striking that while Rashi translates the first part of the description, "A
skillful hunter," referring to Esau's Machiavellian manipulation of his
father, he reserves the literal description of Esau as hunter for his
translation of "man of the field." That is, it seems that he unnecessarily
broadens the range of meaning of "a skillful hunter" to refer to purely
metaphorical "hunting," and then he unnecessarily narrows the meaning
of "man of the field" to refer specifically to hunting.
The key expression in Rashi's comment, however, is batel, "vacant."
Esau is a hunter, because he is vacant, empty of meanings, cut loose from
the intentional energies of life, conscious of his own vitality only in the act
of destroying life.38 Rashi's source reduces the two-part description of
Esau to two words: sudani tzedani—a leisured, "unoccupied person,
roaming the fields, and a hunter of wild animals and birds."39 That is,
Rashi is offering a basic midrashic reading of the whole description of
Esau: the inner code of the man has to do with emptiness and destructive-
ness. Esau emerges as the "field-sports" man, leisured, purposeless,
sensing the pulse of his own life only in the shedding of the blood of
others.
On this reading, Esau lives out the family angst at its harshest. The
"Why?" question ("Of what use is my birthright?") on his lips expresses
deep skepticism about the "uses" of life. ("How weary, stale, flat, and
unprofitable / Seem to me all the uses of this world!"40 It represents the
pure philosophical stance, suggested in Plato's "Philosophy is the  
practice of death." If existence is dominated by the necessity of death, "not
even the gods fight against Necessity."41 Lev Shestov, the Russian-Jewish
early existentialist, defines the beginning of philosophy as "only where
the kingdom of strict Necessity reveals itself. Our thought, in the final
analysis, is only the search for this strict Necessity."42 That is, Greek
thought, filtering down to Western civilization as a whole, is essentially

162
TOLEDOT
submissive to Necessity. This is the thought of Esau, progenitor and
prototype of Greece and Rome, in rabbinic typology.
Shestov characterizes Greek thought as radically "reflective," rather
than passionate, its face turned toward death rather than life:
Philosophy has always meant and wished to mean reflection, Besin-
nung, looking backward. Now it is necessary to add that "looking
backward," by its very nature, excludes the possibility and even the
thought of struggle. "Looking backward" paralyzes man. He who
turns around, who looks backward, must see what already exists, that is
to say, the head of Medusa; and he who sees Medusa's head is inevitably
petrified.43
Esau represents that petrified being of whom Shestov writes. Stony
acquiescence is his response to the heaviness, the fatality of existence, to
the question that haunts Beethoven's last quartet, "Muss es sein?" (Must
it be?). "If so, there is no reward and no resurrection of the dead." He is
unable to hope, to struggle, to will, to dream. In him, death has full
dominion.
The relation between Isaac and Esau always seems enigmatic. "And
Isaac loved Esau, because game was in his mouth, while Rebecca loved
Jacob" (25:28). Even if we understand the word ahav, love, as merely
relative (as, for instance, in the JPS translation, u\s20lC favored Esau"), the
family system clearly falls into two groups. And the nature of Isaac's love
for Esau is strangely addressed in that explanatory clause: "because game
was in his mouth." A taste for game is the basis of Isaac's preference for
the hunting son, the field-sports man.
The Zohar makes the most challenging comment, undercutting our
vague assumption that this love is a case of "attraction of opposites," that
the blind recluse needs the lusty, outdoors energy of Esau to nourish
some inward hunger. On the contrary, the Zohar claims, "Everyone loves
his own kind—one who is similar to himself." What Isaac loves in Esau is
precisely the hunter, the alienated "disintegrated consciousness" of one
for whom all the "noble" privileges and promises of life have dissolved in
blood.
Isaac recognizes the fury evoked by animal life: the desire to extirpate
what has no proper existence. In his own case, existential helplessness led
to withdrawal, to a rigid respect for the priorities and structures of the
given world. To Isaac, the spectacle of Esau's despair turned to destruc-

Sincerity and Authenticity
163
tiveness suggests a passion for truth, an intolerance for palliatives, a kind
of tortured authenticity. To Isaac, Esau is the analytical mind, obsessed
with the unreality of existence. A figure of Byronic melancholy, Esau
appeals to his father's heart: this is a son who deeply needs blessing from a
father who, despite all external differences, intuits the rhythm of his
despair.
The paradoxical similarity of Isaac and Esau is indicated by the
notation of "the field." Isaac is first encountered by Rebecca, "meditating
in the field toward evening" (24:63). "Meditating" translates the word
la-suah, for which many translations are offered, ranging from "walking
among the shrubbery" (sihim) to "praying"44 The more mystical  
understandings of the phrase include in their palette the melancholy coloring
of "toward evening," and the midrashic decodings of "the field" as
referring to Mount Moriah, the site of the Akedah.
What emerges from such a subtle layering of meaning is a portrait of
Isaac imprinted with the deep death-knowledge of his Binding, face
turned toward the dying of the light, darkly narrating his story to God.
The field in which Isaac walks he transforms into the language of prayer.
The field of Esau's darkness, however, is a field of silence; the tension of
ambush, the release of bloodshed provides the illusion of a vital heartbeat
in emptiness. Isaac's love for Esau is a knowing love that seeks to bless—
that is, to animate and populate — that emptiness.
The motif of "walking in fields" that unites Isaac and Esau evokes a
passage in Walter Benjamin's essay, "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire." He
describes the figure of \ht flaneur, a composite figure drawn from Poe
and Baudelaire.45 In his discussion, the situation of the walker in the field
is translated into an account of the flaneur, lonely among city crowds.
Central to both characters is the batel condition. Benjamin describes
moving through traffic, or scanning the advertising pages of a newspaper
in terms that may lead us to read Rashi's "man of the field" definition
with new eyes:
Moving through this traffic involves the individual in a series of shocks
and collisions. At dangerous intersections, nervous impulses flow
through him in rapid succession, like the energy from a battery.
Baudelaire speaks of a man who plunges into the crowd as into a
reservoir of electric energy. Circumscribing the experience of the
shock, he calls this man "a kaleidoscope equipped with consciousness."

164
TOLEDOT
The flaneur is compared to the unskilled worker, who is drilled into
performing simplified operations. Pedestrians "act as if they had adapted
themselves to the machines and could express themselves only  
automatically. Their behavior is a reaction to shocks."47
The drudgery of the laborer is, in its own way, a counterpart to the
drudgery of the gambler. The work of both is equally devoid of
substance.48
The jolting, disconnected trail of the hunter, the sense of drudgery
("for I am weary"), the work that is "devoid of substance" (batel, vacant,
void) —most of all, perhaps, the sense of dismissal of the "weighty past"
("Of what use to me is the birthright? . . . And Esau despised the  
birthright"): all this gives us an Esau who is a prototype victim of the
"thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to."49 Isaac has retired from
the fray: "The Evil Impulse has ceased to trouble him."50 But Esau
staggers from murder to murder (indeed, according to the midrash, from
woman to woman),51 in a search for the consummation that will include
and redeem all traumas: "a consummation devoutly to be wished," says
Hamlet. "To die —to sleep."52
Jacob and Esau: contrast and symmetry
If we compare the twin brothers, Esau is most clearly visible using his
limbs ("the hands are the hands of Esau"; the hunter's legs carry him
from shock to shock) to enact his despair in the world; while Jacob is one
who "sits in tents," essentially limbless, all mind, as, in the traditional
midrashic reading, he studies sacred lore. There is a stark contrast
between the two, which the text seems to emphasize at every turn, and
which the Sages extend to the future history and cultural profiles of the
two peoples who are to descend from them.
But the contrast and symmetry shift considerably, if we look more
closely at the text, and at midrashic versions of the narrative. Jacob
passively "sits in tents," while his brother vigorously ranges the great
outdoors. But what tents are these? The Zohar says enigmatically, "The
tents of Abraham and Isaac." There is a suggestion that Jacob is born
without a strong personal bent of his own. The early years of his maturity
are spent in the created worlds of his father and grandfather; he is
engaged in a search for God by indirection.

Sincerity and Authenticity
165
There is a smoothness about Jacob, which is not merely a matter of
skin texture. "My brother Esau is a hairy man and I am smooth-skinned,"
says Jacob to his mother (27:11). And the midrash speaks of Esau's
disheveled curls in which the stubble from the threshing floor gets
tangled.53 Jacob's smoothness ("baldness") is easily cleaned off by a
gesture of the hand over the head. So, teaches the midrash, Jacob may be
soiled by sin throughout the year but—unlike Esau —he can find  
atonement (lit., wiping over) on the Day of Atonement: sins find no essential
complexity in him in which to take root. The midrash ends with a
comment on its own unparalleled importance: other midrashic parables
may be forced or tendentious, but this one expresses an essential
truth.
Jacob's smoothness refers to the same quality in him as is suggested by
the epithet, "a simple man." He is easily wiped clean: sin finds no deep
roosting place in him. The comparison with Esau seems clearly in Jacob's
favor: Esau is left with an unruly shag full of stubble.
And yet we cannot but notice that in the first description of the
newborn twins, there is no mention made of any such contrast. Esau is
vividly, even grotesquely, described: "The first one emerged red, like a
hairy mantle all over" (25:25). But of Jacob we know only that "he
emerged, holding on to the heel of Esau" (25:26). In other words, we
might say that Jacob, unlike Esau, has no strong self-image from birth.
He is contrasted with his twin only in not being clearly characterized at
all. There is a neutral quality to him; he defines himself as Esau's shadow;
he follows in his wake, his perspective filled with his brother's legs.
According to Rashi, Jacob is named by his father alone —"And he
called him Jacob" —for an opaque, indirect, "follower" quality of his
personality; while Esau is named by all— "And they called him Esau" — for
his obvious precocious maturity, as signified by his "mantle" of hair.
Nothing is said, in fact, of Jacob's smoothness. Indeed, the midrash
strangely emphasizes that the twins are identical, in their early years.54
" 'When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the
field, while Jacob was a simple man who sat in tents' [25:27]. For thirteen
years, they would both go to school and come home from school. At
thirteen, one went to the study house, and the other to pagan temples."
As Rashi puts it, in their childhood, they were indistinguishable. Only
after they achieved maturity did their ways part.

166
TOLEDOT
Jacob constructs his identity
The midrash draws attention to the ways in which Jacob, in particular,
chooses to construct his identity. (There is a subtle asymmetry in the
verse: "And Esau was a skillful hunter . . . and Jacob a simple man." The
lack of a verb in the description of Jacob suggests a less-than-satisfactory
identity, hastily assumed for the purposes of differentiation.) If Esau has
chosen to be a hunter, a complex "disintegrated spirit," a Byronic  
sufferer of angst, then Jacob must assume the opposite role, the passive,
limbless scholar, absorbed in the worlds of his father and his grandfather.
If Esau is a hairy man, then he must be a smooth, sincere man, capable of
periodic at-one-ment, unmenaced by ambiguity.
It is only from Jacob's own description that we see an absolute contrast
between the twins. To himself, he seems painfully smooth, bald,  
immature. It is, indeed, not merely as an obvious physical difference between
the twins, but as a symbolic measure of perceived difference that Jacob
fixes on the hairy-smooth contrast to explain his resistance to his mother's
plan. As we have noticed, Rebecca does not, in fact, speak of  
impersonation. She simply suggests that, whereas Isaac has asked Esau to bring him
food, as a preamble to blessing, Jacob should provide food for his father,
"as he loves it," and as a preamble to blessing (27:6-10). Rebecca's speech
reads almost as a challenge to Jacob to arrive first in Isaac's room, and to
earn blessing by the deliciousness of his food.55 It is Jacob who responds
by describing the clearest contrast between himself and Esau. "Esau is
hairy," he says, "and I am smooth" (27:11).
One dimension of the contrast is registered in the passage we have
quoted from Beresbit Rabbab: to be hairy is to become entangled with the
world, to find it impossible simply to wipe oneself free of sin. In a real
sense, the symbolism of hair suggests impurity, complication, a lodging
place for dirt, as Mary Douglas defines it: matter out of place.56 Impurity
and danger inhere in this modality. Simple, clear categories—the me and
the not-me—are confused. Hair represents the anomalous; it obscures
the pattern. As soon as he reaches the age of self-construction, Jacob
defines himself as a "simple man" —a word that evokes purity and order.
To be smooth, however, also suggests the lack of a densely evolved
sense of self. Surely there is a certain fascination for Jacob in the  
imagining of his brother. A "hairy man" is a sexually mature man.57 The
midrash even puns on saHr ("hairy"/"goat-demon") to suggest a de-

Sincerity and Authenticity
167
monk, vitalistic quality to the imagined Esau: "a demonic man, as in
'goat-demons shall dance there'" (Isaiah 13:21).58
The will to be tragic:
Esau's "Dionysiac" temperament
In the course of a famous discussion of the "Dionysian" impulse, as the
key to understanding the Greeks, Nietzsche asks rhetorically, "What
does that synthesis of god and goat in the Satyr point to? What self-
experience, what 'stress,' made the Greek think of the Dionysian reveller
and primitive man as a satyr?"59 The satyr, the goat-god, comes to
symbolize the dual desire, the longing for beauty and the longing "for the
ugly, the good, resolute desire of the Old Hellene for pessimism, for
tragic myth, for the picture of all that is terrible, evil, enigmatic,  
destructive, fatal at the basis of existence.,, In Nietzsche's view, the Dionysian
madness represents a radical paradox: "What if the Greeks, in the very
wealth of their youth had the will to be tragic and were pessimists? What if
it was madness itself. . . which brought the greatest blessings upon Hellas?"
Nietzsche's understanding of the Greek tragic temperament may
illuminate our reading of Esau, as he is seen by his father and his brother.
His pessimism, his fascination with blood and death, can be interpreted
as arising "fromjoy, from strength, from exuberant health, from overfull-
ness." Perhaps Jacob sees his twin, ruddy and vigorous as well as  
possessed with a "longing for the ugly," as a Dionysian type, a complex satyr,
dancing a vital, enigmatic dance?
The symbolism of hair, indeed, as it is treated in biblical and midrashic
sources, suggests many of the "Dionysian" characteristics. In sheer legal
terms, for instance, the appearance of two hairs signifies the onset of
sexual maturity.60 Hair expresses the ambiguous boundary of self and
world; in the idiom, for example, "Not a hair of his head shall fall to the
ground" (I Samuel 14:45), hair is both part and not part of the body;
while the expression, "a wind passed by me, making hair of my flesh
bristle" (Job 4:15), suggests that hair is, after all, connected with the
nervous system and expresses the inwardness of fear and excitement. Like
erectile tissue, hair can stand on end, drawing public attention to private
emotion. In an extraordinary midrash, Judah is described as having two
hairs that grow out of his chest; when he is angry, they bristle and pierce
his clothes.61 Hair is the interstice between psyche and soma: Judah's hair

168
TOLEDOT
expresses his energy, the force of his anger, its penetrating effect on the
world.
The Jerusalem Talmud62 describes Samson's hair as clanging like a
bell, with the force of the Holy Spirit moving within him. A voice speaks
to Job "from out of the storm [ba-sa'ara]" \ this becomes, in provocative
midrashic misreading, "from every separate hair [se'ar] of Job's head,
God would speak to him." That is, hair represents an ambiguous inner-
outer status, originating from within the body, but vehicle of energies
that have their source in God. Like lawns of grass, in Calvino's essay,
"The Infinite Lawn,"63 hair exemplifies the particular imbued with the
whole, the many, complex resources of vitality of all kinds.
Midrash Tanhuma gives us yet another provocative case of hair
symbolism:
The story is told of a priest who would inspect skin-infections to
diagnose leprosy. He became impoverished and planned to travel
abroad to improve his financial situation. He called his wife and told
her, "People are accustomed to come to me for diagnosis, so it is hard
for me to leave them. Come, I'll teach you how to diagnose. If you see
that the root [the "fountain"] of the hair-follicle is dried up, then you
will know he is ill —for in every single hair, God has created its own
'fountain\* [source of sebumen] to drink from." His wife replied, "If
God has provided a source of nourishment for every hair, what about
you, who are a human being, with many hairs, and your children
depend on you for their livelihood — how much more will God provide
resources for you!" So she prevented him from leaving the Holy
Land.64
With an almost surrealistic focus on the individual hair as vehicle for
inward resources that are the gift of God, the midrash presents us with an
image of the human being, whose many hairs bristle with a vitality born
of a complex hidden nature endowed by God. Such a "hairy" human
being becomes a type for the Dionysian energy of which Nietzsche
speaks: at one pole, animalic, demonic, the "goat-god," the satyr, and at
the other the originator of the tragic vision, longing for beauty and for
ugliness, for pleasure and for pain. For such a creature, self-knowledge
must, of necessity, be a complex process; self-deception must be a  
constant hazard.65 It is not surprising that Jacob opts for smoothness, for
simplicity, for sincerity.

Sincerity and Authenticity
169
Jacob: from sincerity to authenticity
And yet there comes a time when Jacob clothes his smoothness with
goat's hair and goes to his father to be blessed. "And he smelt the
fragrance of his clothes and he blessed him" (27:27). "Nothing,"  
comments Rashi, "smells worse than goat's hair; but the fragrance of Eden
came in with him." (" 'See, the fragrance of my son is like the fragrance of
the field that God has blessed.'") Jacob fears that his father will regard
him as a dissembler, as one who takes serious matters of his own  
authenticity lightly, as one who plays with Esau's voice. In answer to his fear,
Rebecca dresses him in goatskins, foul-smelling—and Paradisal odors
suddenly emanate from him! What notion of selfhood and authenticity
can we glean from this midrash?66
When Jacob confronts his father in grotesque mimicry of his brother,
he significantly reappropriates dimensions of the self that he had "given"
to Esau. At the very beginning of their existence, "the boys struggled [va-
yitrotzetzu] within her" (25:22). The verb seems to derive from the root
rootz, meaning "to run." Rashi quotes two midrashic readings. On the
first reading, each twin tries to escape the womb, when Rebecca passes
the place of his own specific predilection—the house of study, or the
pagan temple. On the second reading, they struggle (clash) with each
other about the inheritance of the two worlds (the temporal world and the
spiritual world-to-come).
On the first reading, the "running" of the twins is in opposite  
directions, driven by congenitally contrary passions. On the second, however,
the running expresses conflict: what, asks Maharal, is the basis of the
conflict, if each twin desires a different world for himself? Maharal
answers by denying the premise: both twins, he asserts, want "the
wholeness of existence," physical and spiritual—that is the basis of the
conflict. No facile role splitting will resolve this primal struggle.  
Difference and identity both mark the fetal twins. The intense energy, the
global desire of both Jacob and Esau, are equivalent in the womb. This,
indeed, is how Ibn Ezra reads the verb: "They raced like streaks of
lightning" (Nahum 2:5),
Jacob, like Esau, desires a full-bodied, as well as full-spirited,  
existence. He has legs for the race and arms for the struggle. But the flashing
energy of Ibn Ezra's image is somehow transformed into the image of a
Jacob "who sits in tents," who leads a sedentary existence, submerged in

170
TOLEDOT
the life of study. Perhaps the family memory of Isaac, bound hand and
foot, haunts Jacob's life, hangs heavy on his limbs. The very reference to
"tents" recalls the powerful description of the studious life, offered by the
Sages themselves: "This is the law—a man who dies in the tent. . ."
begins the passage in Numbers 19:14 that gives the laws of corpse
defilement, which the Talmud deliberately misreads. A man who is truly
committed to Torah study, to the "tents of Torah," has to "die" to the
pleasures of the world.67
In the equally evocative idiom quoted by Rashi (28:9), Jacob will spend
fourteen years "buried,, in the study house of Shem and Ever. The
language of Torah becomes Jacob's trademark; the voice of her son
learning that language in all its subtlety is, according to one midrash,
what Rebecca most loves.68 But there is a sacrifice, a "death" involved in
the submergence in such a high culture. This is akin to the loss described
by Trilling, in Sincerity and Authenticity, of "that 'strength' which,  
Schiller tells us, 'man brought with him from the state of savagery5 and which
he finds it so difficult to preserve in a highly developed culture. The
sentiment of being is the sentiment of being strong." The concern is with
"such energy as contrives that the centre shall hold, that the  
circumference of the self keep unbroken, that the person be an integer,  
impenetrable, perdurable, and autonomous in being if not in action."69
This primitive strength that is diminished by a high culture is the issue
on which Jacob's action in "taking" Esau's blessing pivots. Having "given,"
in his perception and fascinated passivity, the virtues offeree,  
resourcefulness on every level, and complex authenticity to Esau, Jacob is  
suddenly challenged by his mother to take them back, to recognize the
unsuspected ambiguities of his own nature. To bring his father food,
"such as he loves," is to commit himself to the totality of his father's
"knowing" of him, a knowing that goes beyond words.
Until now, Esau has presented himself to his father in such a way that
Isaac has been "nurtured" by him, has received delight from him. That
is, Esau has functioned in the world of seeming: he is a good actor, whose
force of being arouses passion, the "sentiment of being" in Isaac. Till
now, Jacob might have said, like Hamlet, "Seems? . . . I know not seems!"70
He has engaged in no "action" — in the sense that method actors use the
word, to denote the full intent of a particular scene, the desire and
struggle that underlie the mere spoken word. Essentially, he has not
engaged with either his father or his brother at all.

Sincerity and Authenticity
171
Now, his mother urges him into his father's room, to replace Esau in
the act of "feeding" Isaac. At stake is the question of sincerity and
authenticity: Jacob's chosen identity as tarn, as a simple, sincere man, as
against a more complex, "disintegrated" concept of the self. If Jacob is to
feed his father, he must engage in an action, expose himself utterly. The
risks are radical; Jacob condenses them into that one word, ki-metateia —
to seem like a frivolous player with identities, sporting with voices. And
the measure of the success of his confrontation is the strange aside spoken
by Isaac, as the full truth is borne in upon him: "Who was it then that
hunted game and brought it me? —And I ate it all before you came, and I
blessed him. And indeed he is blessed" (27:33). Isaac tasted in Jacob's
food worlds of delight that led inevitably to blessing.71
In an extraordinary manner, the moment when Jacob confronts his
blind father, wearing Esau's skin (goadike, demonic) and even imitating
Esau's voice, becomes a moment when the senses tell spiritual truth.
Isaac, who cannot see, and therefore cannot recognize Jacob, uses all his
other senses to know him. What happens in the "action" of the  
encounter is that Jacob as distinct identity, "simple man," withdrawn from the
field, disappears from the scene. Up to this point, he has been referred to
by name, redundandy; now, Jacob becomes a pronoun. From the  
moment that Isaac touches his son, through his tasting of his son's food, and
the smelling of his clothes (which are of course Esau's clothes), Jacob's
name is not mentioned.
jacob becomes Esau: the ironic posture
This suggests more than the confusion or doubt in Isaac's mind. It evokes
the disappearance of the old self-constructed Jacob, and the birth of a
new hybrid being. Isaac perceives this being, through all his functioning
senses, and udoes not identify him, for his hands were hairy, like those of his
brother Esau" (27:23). In this condition of totally blurred identity72 —
Isaac not deceived by the hairy hands but recognizing a reality beyond
mere naming—Isaac blesses the nameless son, whose voice, touch, taste,
smell convince him of his authenticity.
The paradox is, of course, immense. Jacob assumes disguise, he enters
the world of seeming, he impersonates Esau, and yet his father, knowing
him in a newly intimate mode—suggested by the recurrent word, va-
yigash, to come close (27:21, 22, 25, 26, 27), composes an image of his

172
TOLEDOT
nameless son that draws blessing from him. The fact is, moreover, that
Jacob speaks an outright lie: in answer to his father's question, "Who are
you, my son?" he says, "I am Esau your firstborn" (27:19).
In Hebrew, his self-identification is contained in three words: anokhi
eisav bekhorekba. Traditional commentaries, clearly embarrassed by what
looks like a succinct falsehood, have generally split off the first word
anokhi—"I am" —from the other two —as though to protect Jacob's
integrity from the world of Esau's reality. Rashi, for instance, reads:
"anokhi—I am the one who is bringing you food; eisav bekhorekba —Es&u
is your firstborn."73
There is, however, another possible reading. This rather audaciously
takes Jacob's statement as representing a kind of truth, a truth of  
authenticity, rather than of sincerity. The Or Ha-baim, for instance, suggests
that since Jacob has bought the birthright from Esau, he has acquired
some essential virtue of Esau: "He has become Esau, in the birthright
dimension."
Sefat Emet takes up the idea of impersonation as expressing the desire
to expand the range of self. According to a famous rabbinic statement, it
is sometimes possible to assume the "part," the "role" of another person
in Paradise.74 Jacob assumes the costume of Esau, takes on what had been
Esau's role. This involves Jacob in a new, complex, and dangerous sense
of himself. No longer merely simple, "sincere," he now carries all the
explosive energies, symbolized by hair, by strong limbs. ("And he went
in . . . and he brought. . . the hands are the hands of Esau," which skin
animals and assume disguises.) Now, good and evil are intermingled in
him; he will be forever involved with the ambiguities of the world of
seeming. Sefat Emet concludes paradoxically: "Now that he is dressed in
Esau's clothes, playing his role, it is written, 'And Isaac smelled his
clothes (and blessed him).' And Jacob spoke truth, when he said, 'I am Esau
your firstborn' — in the sense of inward selfhood and destiny."
Jacob, then, is really Esau, as he lays claim to the perceived energies of
his twin brother. "Every profound spirit," says Nietzsche, "needs a
mask."75 Emerson, similarly, writes in his journal for 1841, "Many men
can write better in a mask than for themselves." Trilling provocatively
suggests, "The doctrine of masks proposes the intellectual value of the
ironic posture."76 He points out that the Greek derivation of the word
"irony" means "a dissembler"; and defines the concept as "saying one

Sincerity and Authenticity
173
thing when another is meant ... in order to establish a disconnection
between the speaker and interlocutor, or between the speaker and that
which is being spoken about, or even between the speaker and himself/'
Adopting this last phrase, we may say that Jacob achieves, in the conscious
irony of "I am Esau your firstborn," the "kind of freedom which we call
detachment. If 'existence\* is responded to as if it were less than totally in
earnest, Spirit is the less bound by it. It can then without sadness accept
existence, and without resentment transact such business with it as is
necessary. . . . The human relation to it need not be fixed and categorical;
it can be mercurial and improvisational.,,77
Jacob can, then, be seen as speaking in conscious irony, so as to
establish a disconnection, primarily, "between the speaker and himself.,,
This gives him the kind of freedom that is based on detachment, on a
salutary sense of performance that extends his possibilities of play. He thus
enters the world that the Ishbitzer calls the world ofsafek, of doubt, where
authenticity can perhaps only be traced retroactively.78
"All life/' claims Nietzsche, "rests on appearance, art, illusion, optics,
necessity of perspective and error."79 Anathema to such a view, for
instance, is Christian dogma, "which is only and will be only moral, and
which, with its absolute standards, for instance, its truthfulness of God,
relegates — that is, disowns, convicts, condemns — art, all art, to the realm
offalsehood."
It is precisely such a perspective, I would suggest, that underlies those
midrashic narratives about occasions when God Himself "changes,"
improvises on the truth, "for the sake of peace."
We looked earlier at the motif of God's changing Isaac's appearance,
making him resemble Abraham, in order to convince the mocking world
of a hidden truth.80 This is a case of irony in action: God yields, as it were,
to the world of optics, is prepared to "change," to prevaricate with the
rigid forms of life, in order to validate improbable continuities. Existence
is accepted in the mode of play, which, Schiller says, overcomes "the
earnestness of duty and destiny." "Man only plays when he is in
the fullest sense of the word a human being, and he is only fully a
human being when he plays."81 This position, Trilling proposes, is not a
nihilistic one, but indeed is animated by a real moral earnestness. Within
the midrashic tradition, God plays frequently, and with earnest intent;
and man is most fully human when he imitates God, in work and at play.

174
TOLEDOT
grossing the threshold
In a similar vein, Jacob's fear of being misunderstood as ki-metateia, as a
frivolous player with voices and roles, rises out of the moral earnestness of
one who has entered the world of "appearance, art, illusion, optics,
necessity of perspective and error." The midrash describes that moment
of entry. Rebecca invests Jacob in Esau's clothes and skins, and then
accompanies him to the petah, the doorway of Isaac's room. There, she
says, "Till now, I owed you my support— from now on, your Creator will
stand by you."82 She then puts the food into his hand, and he brings it
across the threshold to his father.
The petah, the threshold, is that liminal place where status changes,
and new realities begin. In halakhic (legal) terms, the petah belongs
neither to the internal space nor to the external. It is a marginal,  
ambiguous area with powers and dangers of its own.83
The symbolism of the mother accompanying her son to the petah
evokes the powerful birth parable in the Jerusalem Talmud:84 " 'The
devisings of man's mind are evil from his youth' (Genesis 8:21): Said R.
Yudan, '"From his youth [mine'urav]" is spelt defectively. Therefore,
read it, 'From the time that he shakes himself [punning on the root na Vr,
youth, energetic movement] and comes out into the world.'"'"
Evil begins in man from the moment of birth (and not, as some claim,
from the moment of conception): this is the moment of exit, or of
entrance into the world, depending on one's perspective. "At the entrance,
sin lies in wait" [Genesis 4:7], the Talmud85 quotes God, as he urges Cain
to "accept existence and without resentment transact such business with
it as is necessary."86 To be born is to leave the simplicity, the "sincerity,"
of life-with-mother and to cross a threshold into a world ruled by
"appearance, art, illusion, optics, necessity of perspective and error."
Such birth is empowered by the energies of evil; limbs are charged to
play the roles of life. Jacob, interestingly, is described in the Bereshit
Rabbah narrative as crossing that threshold, "compelled, bowed, and
weeping."87 He loses control of his muscles, his heart is as soft as wax, and
God has to place two angels on either side of him to support him.88 He is a
novice in the world of the disintegrated consciousness: the passage of
birth is palpably traumatic for him.
But by the time he has been touched by his father, he is able to answer
Isaac's reiterated question, "Are you really my son Esau?" with the single

Sincerity and Authenticity
175
vford, Ani— "I am" (27:24). This is the response of authentic being, clear
of the strain of role playing. It is this Ani of inner freedom that the
midrash compares to the ani of an angel in a very different narrative. This
is the story of the birth of Samson, in the book of Judges. The angel
announces the birth of a son (Samson) to Manoah's wife. Rather coarsely,
Manoah interrogates the angel when he reappears: "Are you the man
who spoke to the woman?" Qudges 12:13). The angel replies, "I am
(Ani)" And the midrash amplifies: "The angel said, 'You think of me as a
man, but I am not a man—I am an angel.' Similarly, when Isaac asked
Jacob, 'Are you my son Esau?' he replied, 'Ani—I am—I am not Esau, but
Jacob.'"89
The answer, Ani, essentially reserves the "sentiment of being" from
all public influence. No social or even familial pressure will shape Jacob's
sense of his identity. The authentic self disengages from the conceptions
of others; the Jacob who can szyAni resists any attempt to pluck out the
heart of his mystery.
If the entry into Isaac's room represents a kind of moral birth to fall
personhood, we can identify the climax of the scene as the moment where
Isaac recognizes that the hybrid being in his arms carries his own  
blessedness within himself. Here the paradox of masked authenticity reaches its
point of highest tension. Isaac asks his son yet again to "come close," this
time not to be touched only, but to be kissed. "And he came close and he
kissed him. And he smelled his clothes and he blessed him, saying, 'See,
the smell of my son is like the smell of the field that God has blessed. May
God give you . . . '(2 7:2 7-2 8). The climax of the encounter is, of course,
the blessing; but the blessing emerges seamlessly from the kiss and from
Isaac's soliloquy (he is not talking to Jacob — "See, the smell of my son")
about fragrance and fields already blessed by God.
The word Re'eh, with which Isaac begins his speech, means literally,
"Lookl the smell of my son. . . ." The effect of sense-confusion —called
by the French symbolist poets synaesthesia—yields an impression of  
mystical transcendence. Limitations of the senses no longer define the
knowledge Isaac has of the nameless son in his arms. He sees and smells
Jacob's clothes (which include the foul-smelling goatskins), and attains
a moment of enlightenment (the JPS translation of Re'eh is simply, "Ah\
the smell of my son"). There is no discontinuity, no jolt, no conscious
decision to bless his son. Instead, there is an intimation of a field and of
blessedness, the "fragrance of Eden," according to the midrash,90 so that

176
TOLEDOT
"his mind becomes calm,"91 and the words flow spontaneously from a
sensuous-spiritual knowledge.
The Zohar92 carries the notion a step further. The text, "And he said,
'See! the smell of my son'" can be read two ways. The obvious reading is:
"Isaac said, 'See! . . .'" But it can also be read: "God said, 'See! . . .'"
Meshekh Hokhmah suggests a synthesis: "God spoke out of Isaac's mouth
[that is, Isaac was divinely inspired], 'See! There is no longer any need to
protect yourself against seeing. You can abandon the defensive strategy of
blindness. The one who stands in front of you will irritate no optic
nerves.'"
Here, however, the paradox of impersonation and authenticity  
becomes most challenging. For what Isaac smells in the moment of  
illumination and inspiration is not "Jacob's clothes" but Esau's clothes. That
is, it is the deception in its essential expression, the mask, the irony with
which Jacob now improvises his role, that Isaac apprehends—and  
apprehends as blessed.
These ambiguous "clothes" become the subject of fascinating mid-
rashic meditation. Goatskins may smell rank, but these clothes are from
Eden, the paradisal garb of Adam in the Garden; the "field" is the "field
of apples," again a reference to Eden; when Jacob enters Isaac's room,
the fragrance of Eden enters with him.93
Another line of interpretation suggests that the smell is of the incense
which will rise from the Temple on Mount Moriah—a coded reference to
Isaac's relation to the "field" ("Isaac called the Temple 'the field' ").94 A
startling connection is suggested between Isaac's Moriah experience (his
Binding) and the future offering of incense in that same field, which had
become a dream place of despair and mortal ennui to his son Esau.
Incense becomes a symbol of what is to redeem that angst of absurdity
and weariness that Esau represents. For it is composed of eleven spices —
of complex, even esoteric composition—including the spice called gal-
banum (helbonah), which is notoriously foul-smelling. In a classic analogy,
the essential rankness in the whole sweet-smelling composition is  
compared to the essential presence of sinners among the community,  
particularly on a fast day.95 The pungency of evil is a necessary ingredient in the
social structure of the people, and perhaps also in the personal  
psychology of the individual. Incense comes to represent the powerful  
interactions of the Akedah experience, with its dangers and despairs, with life-

Sincerity and Authenticity
111
affirming perspectives. Such perspectives require the Akedah dimension,
if they are to have force and significance.
The clothes of impersonation: incense and treachery
As Isaac smells incense from Jacob's clothes, which are the clothes of
impersonation, the paradox of the scene reaches its height. As though to
emphasize the paradox, the midrash plays on the word for "clothes":
" 'And he smelled his clothes' —do not read, 'his clothes [begadav],' but
'his traitors [bogdav].' "96 There follows a narrative about the return to the
fold of two Jewish traitors, whose passionate repentance becomes a
paradigm for the people. Isaac smells the hazards of treachery and evil
that are contained within the complexity, the ambiguous perception of
the world, that Jacob now bears. No longer simple or sincere, Jacob is
forced to be many things, to play many parts. Yet, despite the dangers in
this expanded notion of authenticity, Isaac senses a wholeness, a health
and strength, that leads him intuitively to blessing.97
The Zohar makes the essential comment. Isaac smells the treacherous
clothes, the foul goatskins, which the midrashic traditions describe as
fragrant with paradise. But how does this alchemy work? How is evil
transformed into an essential ingredient of blessing? The text says, "He
smelled his clothes and he blessed him, saying, 'Look! the smell of my son is
like the smell of the field that God has blessed.'" And the Zohar  
comments:98 Only when Jacob wears the clothes do they smell of Eden—Isaac
speaks, significantly, of the "smell of my son?
The sentiment of being
A potential beauty is released from the ambiguities of the "disintegrated
consciousness." Jacob searches for his authenticity among all the "lend-
ings" of the theatrical wardrobe. What Isaac senses is the "smell of my
son," which transforms the costumes of insincerity.99 It is ultimately the
essence of his son—permeating clothes and skins —that registers as
blessing.
The Jacob who leaves his father's presence (lit., his father's face
[27:30]) knows himself as he has seen himself mirrored in his father's
blind eyes. Like Winnicott's infant, mirrored in his mother's gaze,100 he is
truly born to selfhood, as he "goes out" of the infant stage of growth. To

178
TOLEDOT
"go out" is to engage in dangerous, necessary separations, to realize one's
sentiment of being. In a beautiful passage in Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, the
midrash describes the inward state of Jacob, at this moment of his life:
When Jacob left his father's presence, he left adorned like a  
bridegroom and like a bride in her ornaments. And there descended on him
reviving dew from heaven, and his bones were covered with fat; and he,
too, became a champion fighter and athlete. That is why it is said: "By
the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob—There, the shepherd, the rock
of Israel" (Genesis 49:24).101
The physical vigor that is described here is first sensed as the  
"ornaments" of a new status. Jacob is transformed: he "wears" his new,
enriched self—even the dew that brings him to new life seems to come
down on his skin, from outside himself. (Of course, this is a reference to
the words of Isaac's blessing: "May God give you of the dew of heaven and
the fat of the earth. . . .")
But ultimately, the description suggests a radiant awareness of new
possibilities that springs from deep within the self. The bones that are
covered with fat evoke the text in Proverbs 15:30: "Good news puts fat on
the bones." The "good news" of the blessings — considered as an  
existential event, rather than merely as words spoken—gives Jacob a sense of
health and power that affects his very bones. In Hebrew, the word for
"bones"— atzamot—is closely related to the word for "self" — etzem.
What is nourished — even created anew—in Jacob is the essence of his
selfhood. Suddenly, suggests the midrash, Jacob is aware of the complex
coherence that holds his bones together. He can articulate his body, with
power and control.
What Jacob has gained in his impersonation of Esau is a sense of power
in his limbs. He has "mighty hands"; the reference to the shepherd who
deals with the stone takes us on to the first stage of Jacob's encounter with
the ordeals and promises of Exile. (While Laban's shepherds stand
helpless, Jacob effortlessly removes the stone from the well — "like a cork
from a jar," says Rashi, "to show you that his strength was great" [29:10].)
"And he, too, became a champion fighter and athlete," continues the
midrash. "He, too—like Esau." The impersonation has freed Jacob to a
new sense of what Oliver Sacks writes of as "proprioception."102  
Perceptive use of hands and legs is restored. What had been alienated — "given"
to Esau—is now reappropriated. With it comes the power to integrate
sensations "to the level of perceptions that were related to the world" and

Sincerity and Authenticity
179
to oneself; the power to "to say, 'I perceive, I recognize, I will, I act/ "103
The experience of "re-realization" often occurs suddenly, Sacks notes:
"There is, as it were, a critical (functional and ontological) threshold."104
To be born as a "motor individual," a first impulse of desire for wholeness
is necessary. The strength of Jacob's hands is re-realized on the day that
he skins the animals and lays them over his own skin.
Sacks poignantly describes the return to proprioception:
Everything was transformed, absolutely, in that moment, in that leap
from a cold fluttering and flashing to the warm stream of music, the
stream of action, the stream of life. . . . [It] was essentially and indivisi-
bly a stream, an organic whole, without any separations or seams, but
articulate, articulated, articulate with life. An entirely new principle
came into effect—what Leibniz called a "new active principle of
unity" — a unity only present in, and given by, action.105
The wholeness of the sentiment of being, of full, integrated  
articulation, is suggested by the simple description of Jacob walking out into the
world: "And Jacob went out of Beer Sheva. . . . And Jacob lifted up his
legs and he went. . ." (29:1). Rashi's comment illuminates our theme:
"His heart lifted up his legs and he became light on his feet." The active
principle of unity harmonizing powerful complexities is the hope that
Jacob himself first articulated, when he found it in himself to say,
2\*11-"I am."
The "demon dance" of Esau, which had fascinated Jacob, is now
subsumed into the powerful, controlled movements of a different dance.
In this way, Isaac's limbs, bound and helpless, are finally released. Jacob
leaves his father and, whole in skin and bone, arms and legs articulated by
the inner music of the Ani—U\ am" —he is quickened into life. "Every
disease is a musical problem, every cure a musical solution" (Novalis).
The blessings that, according to the midrash,106 had been tenuously
his, are to become consolidated, appropriated by the energy of his own
being. This is a process of affirming and confirming, "in his hand." It
begins when that hand clothes itself in insincere skins, out of a desire to
emerge into greater wholeness.

Energy is only Life, and is from the Body. Energy is eternal Delight.
— William Blake
The imprint of absence
"Jacob left Beer Sheva, and set out for Haran" (28:10).
Jacob embarks on a journey away from his parents — at their bidding—
and, in the course of twenty years in Haran, he marries four wives, has
twelve children, and amasses a fortune. At this point, he returns with his
family and acquisitions to Canaan and, eventually, to his father's house.
This is a journey that is pointedly different from his grandfather's
originating journey: the lekh lekha wandering to the place yet to be shown,
the place of promise and destiny. Jacob does not simply "go" (lekh); he
"leaves" (va-yetze). What has been achieved and known for two  
generations he now relinquishes. And his destination is specific and named:
"Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and gone to Padan Aram"
(28:7).
Jacob's journey has a clearly delineated beginning and end. But its
purpose is ambiguous, as indicated in the subdued irony of that bland
clause, "Jacob had obeyed his father and mother." His parents both
trigger his journey, but with very different motivations. Rebecca warns
him that Esau is out to kill him in revenge for "taking" Isaac's blessing.
Using the same compelling admonition as on that previous occasion
("Now, my son, listen to me"), she urges him: "Flee at once [kum] to
Haran" (27:43). Isaac too summons Jacob and commands him, in a
parallel speech: "Up [kum] go to Padan Aram" (28:2). In leaving, Jacob
obeys both parents. Doubly, perhaps ambivalently motivated, he flees
180

Dispersions
181
from his vengeful brother and he goes to find a wife abroad, in the
Mesopotamian origins of the family. He is moved by forces from both his
past and his future.
Thus we live in a most strange dilemma
between the distant bow and the too piercing
arrow.1
Neither "fleeing" nor "going," however, is emphasized in the title
word, Va-yetze ("And he left"). Rashi questions the purpose of this
opening clause. He offers a classic midrashic response: "This tells us that
the 'leaving\* of a righteous person from a place makes an imprint. As long
as the righteous person is in the city, he is its glory and light and majesty.
When he leaves, its glory, light and majesty are evacuated" (28:10).
On one level, this midrash is communicating the perception of  
absence. There is an imprint, a new awareness of the greatness of a person
precisely when his physical presence is removed. Sartre writes in his
childhood reminiscences, Words, of the occasion on which he first  
realized the meaning of significant absence. His grandfather
made a pronouncement which pierced me to the heart: "Someone's
lacking here: it's Simonnot.". . . In the centre of a tumultuous circle, I
saw a pillar: Monsieur Simonnot himself, absent in flesh and blood.
This astonishing absence transfigured him. A great many people  
connected with the Institute were absent. . . . Only Monsieur Simonnot
was lacking. It had been enough to mention his name: emptiness had
sunk into that crowded hall like a knife. I was amazed that a man had his
place fixed. His place: a void hollowed out by universal expectation, an
invisible womb from which it seemed one could suddenly be reborn.2
The imprint, the full awareness of the indispensable person, is known
only after he has removed himself from his place.
Rashi speaks of a void left behind Jacob as he begins his journey. But
perhaps the void is in Jacob, as well. As he "goes out" of his place, a
vacuum separates him from his origins, a kind of necessary detachment.3
If Jacob is to find a wife, he must separate himself from his parents, body,
mind, and heart. "Sometimes," declares the midrash,4 "one goes toward
one's mate, and sometimes one's mate comes toward oneself." In this
case, and by contrast with his father, who waited at home for his mate to
come toward him, Jacob has to undertake a journey, if he is to marry at all.

182
VA-YETZE
This is clearly more than a physical journey: it involves a movement away
from the essential place of family and destiny, in order to fulfill not only
his father's bidding but perhaps even God's primal statement: "Hence a
man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, so that they
become one flesh" (2:24).
To attach oneself fully to a wife apparently involves an act of  
abandonment. Only so can Jacob's twenty-year absence be justified. A project has
to be completed, which requires a movement away from his parents, a
detachment from previous identities and fixities. The purpose of this
process is indicated in the enigmatic words —spoken, according to a
traditional reading,5 by God himself— "so that they become one flesh.,,
Rashi takes this as referring to the child who is the being in whom the
separate "flesh,, of the parents unites. Rashi here avoids any "romantic"
understanding of "one flesh": no full union is possible between a couple
other than what is physically created by both of them.
Ramban, on the other hand, rejects Rashi's view as not being  
specifically human: animals, too, produce "one flesh," when they procreate.
Here, he claims, is the characteristic of human coupling that marks it off
from the matings of the animal world: it is not random and short-lived,
but
since the first human couple were created bone of each other's bone
and flesh of each other's flesh, he would cling to her and she would be
in his bosom as his own flesh, and he would desire her as his constant
companion. As it was with Adam, so with his descendants—the males
hold fast to their wives, leave their fathers and mothers, and see their
wives as though they were one flesh with them.
In Ramban's reading, to be "one flesh" is the existential ground of
marriage: to become one — not simply in a sexual, momentary sense, or in
the procreating of children. The couple sets up a new reality, which
involves a certain movement away from the givens of heredity and
background. The paradigm of Adam and Eve, who of course have no
parents to abandon, expresses the totality of the marriage relationship.
There is a muted irony in the appeal to such an absolute model, in which
betrayals and abandonments, shifts of loyalty, have no place. Future
human couples will experience the full problematics of such  
abandonments, as they attempt to negotiate the paradoxes of separateness and
identity.

Dispersions
183
The yearning for inner space
In Jacobs case, the issue becomes explicit and central to his whole life. In
order to found the "house of Israel," he leaves his parents' house. A
unitary innocence is abandoned. He begins his life as a "mild man who
stayed in camp" (25:27). In his earlyyears, Jacob is imagined as  
characteristically inhabiting inner spaces. For fourteen years, narrates the mid-
rash,6 he is "buried" in the house of Shem and Ever: in the study house,
he constructs his internal world of mind and spirit. Then comes a
moment of "going out," of birth into the external world; he must leave
his parents' home; years later, Laban shrewdly comments, "You were
longing for your father's house" (31:30). Through all twenty years of
energy and hard work, a profound yearning for the inner space of origin
has animated him.
The image of the house is central to Jacob's responses. After his dream
at Beth-El, Jacob immediately describes the place as "the house of God"
(28:17); and the Talmud notices the importance of the bayyit, the house,
in his imagination. An important midrashic tradition claims that the site
of Jacob's dream is Mount Moriah, the future place of the Holy Temple.
This is the center of the universe, the axis mundi: all the patriarchs
describe it, using the imagery of their deepest experience. Jacob names it
Beth-El, the House of God, choosing an image of inwardness and
coherence. And God prefers Jacob's image to that of Abraham, who sees
a mountain, as the formal image of highest holiness, and to that of Isaac,
who sees a field.7 Therefore, the Talmud affirms, the Holy Temple is
called the "house of the God of Jacob" (Isaiah 2:3): it is his lifelong
passion for the bayyit, for the structure that contains and defines its
contents, that will ultimately characterize the religious imagination of his
descendants.
But this is no simple nostalgia for home and hearth. In order to achieve
the marriage for which he wrenches himself away from parents and
promised land, he will have to travel outwards, break through many
boundaries. Unlike Abraham, his grandfather, he is not traveling, in any
simple sense, toward the land of promise. Abraham began his journey in
response to God's word. In Jacob's case, God is silent. Without express
guidance from God, Jacob has to "go away," to diffuse the focused
experience of his father's house, the study house, the land of promise.
Unlike Isaac, Jacob will have no servant to bridge the gap between inward
and outward, to bring him home a wife.

184
VA-YETZE
The very terms in which God blesses him, in the dream at Beth-El, are
expansive and even violent in their resonance: "You shall spread out [u-
faratzta] to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south"
(28:14). This, it is true, will lead to blessing for the whole world ("All the
families of the earth shall bless themselves by you"). But the word
U'faratzta ("You shall spread out"), which Rashi reads as an indication of
strength, does have explosive, even destructive implications. It often
suggests the breaking of structures;8 indeed the midrash specifically
interprets "One who makes a breach [ha-poretz] goes before them"
(Micah 2:13) as a reference to Jacob, in whose merit God breaks open the
Red Sea for his descendants.9
This is a strange blessing for one for whom simplicity, harmony,
structure, and inwardness are essential elements of his imagination and
temperament. God here endows him with a strength that acknowledges
no limits, that tears apart and drives through. On a literal level, the
blessing is realized in the economic success that Jacob achieves: "Va-
yifrotz ha-ish me yod me yod" — "So the man burst outwards very, very much,
and came to own large flocks, maidservants and menservants, camels and
asses" (30:43). The fugitive who crossed the river with a walking stick as
his sole property (32:11) has extended his being into the world of  
possessions. He has "broken through" the opaqueness of things and attached
them to himself.
The paradox of Jacob's destiny appears at its clearest, perhaps, in the
question of marriage. It is one wife that Isaac and Rebecca have in mind
when they send him off to Haran. Jacob's intention in his years of working
for Laban is described by the prophet Hosea: "There, Israel served for a
wife, for a wife he had to guard sheep" (12:13). The entire focus of Jacob's
labor and night vigils is "a wife."10 Alone among the patriarchs, Jacob is
described as loving his wife with a love that transforms time; he loves
Rachel at first sight, and he works for seven years, which "seemed to him
but a few days because of his love for her" (29:20). There seems to be a
natural progression here, from Abraham, with his two wives, to Isaac,
who is monogamous but has a servant for matchmaker, and who loves his
wife only after marriage, to Jacob, whose love is self-chosen and filled
with an energy of intentionality.
When he finishes his seven years of labor for Rachel, he speaks to
Laban with a candor that has astonished many readers: "Give me my
wife, for my time is fulfilled, that I may cohabit with her" (Ut., that I may
come into her). In Rachel, Jacob seeks his home, in senses beyond the

185
sexual only. He seeks the unity of which Ramban speaks, when he
describes the "one flesh" of human marriage. "A consummation  
devoutly to be wished,,, perhaps—but not what God has in store for him.
Instead of one wife he gets four. With love comes jealousy and hatred.
The plot twists and thickens, in a way that is both blessing and perplexity
to Jacob.
The darkness of exile
In leaving home, Jacob goes out into exile. This is an exile not only from
his geographical home but, in some radical sense, from himself. His
going out makes an imprint on himself: how is he to know himself in that
strange country, that darkness of exile? As he begins his journey, the sun
sets (28:11); when he returns, twenty years later, the narrative describes a
sunrise (32:32). Both these markers of time, the midrash suggests, are
functions of Jacob's personal sense of time.11 Between these two points,
there is darkness, the Dark Night of the Soul.
The most significant event of the Parsha, Jacob's marriage, is  
diffracted, its single focus shattered, during one dark night. Obviously, a
little light on the wedding night would have made Laban's deception
impossible. What happens during the night is irreparable, however. All
the recognition of the morning cannot alter the reality of what has been
transacted between Jacob and Leah. "When morning came, there was
Leah!" (29:25). "But during the night, she was not Leah. Rachel had
given her the secret code words that Jacob, fearing deception, had given
Rachel" (Rashi).
In some real sense, Leah becomes Rachel during the night. That is the
very nature of the night, of the world of exile. Identities meld into one
another, faces and forms swirl in the dark, meeting and splitting off,
beckoning and mocking. Where the visual is so untrustworthy, great
weight is placed on the voice, on language. And it is primarily in this
medium that, according to the midrash, Jacob is most poignantly betrayed.
Describing the preparations for the wedding of Jacob and Rachel, the
midrash in Bereshit Rabbah emphasizes the oral, voices speaking, hinting
at deception, playing with words to reveal or veil the truth:
All that day, they prepared for the wedding, with song and celebration.
Jacob asked, "Why are you doing me so much kindness?" They
replied, "You have done us much kindness through your presence

186
VA-YETZE
among us," and they praised him and sang, "Ha Lea! Ha Lea!"
[hinting at the deception through the ululations of joy]. In the evening,
they came and put out the lights. He said, "What is this? Why have you
put out the lights, while men and women are mingling with one
another?" They answered, "What do you think—that we are dissolute
as rams?" [Rashi: "We express our modesty by bringing the bride to
the groom in the dark"] And all that night, he called her, "Rachel!" and
she answered him. In the morning, "And behold, she was Leah" [lit.].
He said to her, "Deceiver, daughter of a deceiver! Did I not call you
Rachel last night and you answered me?!" She replied, "Is there a
master without students? Did your father not call you Esau and you
answered him?!"12
Jacob, it seems, expects voices to tell the truth. He hears neither the
play within the ululation of the wedding guests, nor the tension between
voice and meaning in Leah's responses. The midrash emphasizes the
darkness, not merely as a plot necessity, but as suggesting contrary
symbolisms: to Jacob, darkness means mingling, loss of distinctness and
structure, moral dissoluteness; while Laban's accomplices affirm the
modesty of darkness as a cover for shame.
Jacob's suspicion of darkness is immediately validated: the substitution
of Leah for Rachel is a function of precisely the kind of manipulation of
reality that Jacob most fears. The fully stated clarity of his love is blurred
by the introduction of Leah into his intimate life. From now on,  
everything will be relative, the echo of the voice of one wife will resound
through the words of the other: "And he came also to Rachel, and he loved
also Rachel more than Leah" (29:30).
Jacob's love for Rachel is stained by comparison, by coming after. His
hate for Leah is palpable to her only after he has married Rachel (29:31—33):
what might have been interpreted as indifference changes color by the
side of the Jacob-Rachel relationship. Eventually, two more wives, Bilhah
and Zilpah, are added to the family. Many children are born: but the
single-minded passion with which Jacob had demanded, "Give me my
wife, that I may come in to her," is diffracted into the jealousies, the side
glances and negotiations of wives vying with each other for favor.
This diffraction, the modality of "more,"13 increasing complication
and proliferation, breeds in the darkness, in the domain of the oblique,
the illusory, the ambiguous. This is the darkness that begins as Jacob
leaves his parents' house and the land of promise. Instantly, precipitately,

Dispersions
187
the sun sets. "And Jacob went out . . . and he hit on a place [lit.] and he
stayed there overnight, for the sun had set" (28:10-11). The onset of
darkness is related in the pluperfect— "And the sun had set" — and not as
part of the normal order of events ("and the sun set, so Jacob stayed
overnight"). Rashi therefore quotes the midrash: "The sun set for him
suddenly, earlier than usual, so that he would indeed spend the night
there."
The encounter with darkness: the Evening Prayer
Dramatic, unexpected encounter happens here, in space and in time. "He
collided with a certain place" —the word va-yifga suggests a dynamic
encounter with an object that is traveling toward oneself. The force of the
meeting is palpable but mysterious. Traditionally, the "certain place" is
identified with Mount Moriah, "where Jacob's father was bound in
sacrifice."14 This is the future place of the Holy Temple, of prayer and
sacrifice, of the human attempt to come close to God. It is a place of
purity and danger, of great longing and strict distancing. But the makom,
the "certain place," is equally a metaphoric reference to God Himself,
"who is the Place of the universe, while the universe is not His place."15
Jacob, therefore, makes contact here with God Himself. There is a shock
of spiritual recognition, which is hinted at in the classic midrashic  
translation of va-yifga: "he prayed . . . Jacob initiated the Evening Prayer. Each
of the patriarchs initiated one of the three daily prayers, responding to
the three phases of the day: at evening, a person should say, "May it be
Thy will, O Lord my God, that You bring me out of darkness into
light."16
Jacob is, in fact, the first human being to pray in the dark. There is a
terror, a "blocking" quality to the night. "He tried to pass through, but
the world became entirely like a wall in front of him."17 Darkness looms
suddenly, unexpectedly, barring his passage. But this darkness is  
deliberately precipitated by God, "so as to speak to Jacob in private—like a king
who calls for the lights to be extinguished, as he wishes to speak to his
friend in private."
This explanation for the early nightfall—as permitting a certain  
intimacy of relationship between God and Jacob—is different from the one
Rashi refers to: "God made the sun set early, so that he would spend the
night there" Rashi's source emphasizes the contrast: God wants darkness,

188
VA-YETZE
not as cover for intimate dialogue, but simply so that Jacob should sleep in
that place: "God said, 'This righteous man has come to My lodging
house —shall he get off without sleeping the night here?'"18
It is Mount Moriah, the place of the Holy Temple, where his father
was bound in sacrifice, that Jacob names, with a certain domestic  
familiarity, the House of God (28:19). It is this local, intimate quality that
Jacob brings for the first time to the understanding of God: "Jacob
initiated the Evening Prayer." In encountering the darkness, he was the
first person to achieve the previously impossible act of "praying in the
darky "Obviously," asserts the Sefat Emet, "it is not within the power of
one who sits in darkness to pray—as in the aphorism, 'One who is bound
cannot free himself.' "19 Leaving all support systems behind him, Jacob
moves into the world of the night. Here, nothing is clear, all is shifting,
phantasm, illusion. And here, paradoxically, Jacob finds his ground of
truth.
This ground of truth is the very meaning of the "certain place" that
Jacob suddenly encounters. In the narrative in Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer,
"God met him there. And why is He called The Place? — Because in every
place where the righteous are [where the righteous stand: Yalkut], there
He is with them, as it is said, 'In every place where I mention My name, I
shall come to you and bless you.'" The sacredness of the place, of the
encounter with God, is based on the "standing," the stable, vertical
being, of the righteous. Wherever the righteous are, in the fullness of
selfhood, calling out God's name, they elicit His presence through their
prayer.
In this reading, the place of meeting is marked out by human beings:
God responds to the intimate but total summons of the righteous. And
yet, there is surprise: Jacob prays to God and finds that he has invented a
new genre of prayer. For night has fallen. He intended to pray in
daylight,20 in the mode of all human prayer till then, drawing strength
from the light of the sun; but God put out the lights and Jacob discovers a
new possibility— almost an impossibility, an oxymoron, as the Sefat Emet
conceives it—called the Evening Prayer.
Tie paradox of sleep
There is something essential, if not yet conscious, in Jacob, that prepares
him to be the inventor of the Evening Prayer. The place, the prayer,

Dispersions
189
God's presence — all are contingent on the being of the righteous person.
Only the time —the night—falls suddenly in his path, so that he will
encounter God in a new way. And here arises the strangeness of God's
purpose: the place of night experience is simply called "My lodging
house"; all God wants of Jacob is that he sleep there, in the most sacred
place in the world. "Shall he get off without a night's sleep there?," God
asks, as though such sleep is the ultimate religious duty. And so, the
Torah tells how "Jacob lay down in that place" (28:11). And Rashi
sharpens the emphasis: "In that place, he lay down, but during the
fourteen years that he lived in the study house of Ever, he never lay down
at night, for he was preoccupied with Torah."
For fourteen years, according to this enigmatic midrash, Jacob has
turned night into day, relentlessly pursuing the clarities of a scholar's life.
The paradox is manifest: the one night of sleep Jacob enjoys is in the holy
place. It is followed by twenty more years of sleeplessness, as Jacob
himself recounts to Laban: "Scorching heat ravaged me by day and frost
by night; and sleep fled from my eyes" (31:40). Alert to sensations, to the
differing sensual experience of day and night, Jacob works and watches,
from the time he leaves Canaan to the time he returns. In effect, a
continuous vigil of sleepless nights over a period of thirty-four years is
interrupted by one significant night of sleep, here in the House of God.
Rashi's comment underlines the inner tension of such an experience.
When Jacob wakes up, he says, "Surely the Lord is present in this place,
and I did not know it" (28:16). Many commentators probe the  
significance of "I did not know it." Why does Jacob mark out his ignorance of
God's presence? How would knowledge have affected his behavior?
Seforno, for instance, suggests very plausibly, "If I had known, I would
have prepared myself for prophecy—and this I did not do." Rashi,  
however, chooses to follow a midrashic perception: "If I had known, I would
not have slept."
On one level, the idea of sleep as a kind of sacrilege in a holy place is
quite plausible. The basic text is, "You shall venerate [lit., fear] My
sanctuary" (Leviticus 19:30). Belatedly realizing the sacredness of the
place, Jacob is filled with penitent awe: "And he was afraid, and he said,
How awesome is this place!" The sense of the fearfulness of the place
should have prevented him from sleeping here: the sense that Rudolph
Otto describes as the numinous awareness of the Other, of that which is
incommensurate with humanity. Such a sense finds legal expression in

190
VA-YETZE
several sources: "One does not behave frivolously in the synagogue . . .
and one does not sleep there."21 "R. Zeira's students asked him, 'How
have you deserved such long life?' He answered: 'I did not sleep in the
house of study.' "22 In the Temple, sleep is forbidden; even to sit in the
courtyard is permitted only to kings of the Davidic dynasty.23
The vigilant awe that should be the response to the holy place is
dispelled in the posture of sleep. In Rashi's view, Jacob suffers a kind of
guilt over this, as he wakes up. But the paradox is clear: if Jacob had not
slept, he would not have dreamed of God and angels, would not have
received his first message from God, and would not know that this is a
holy place. Furthermore, as we have seen, the midrash emphasizes God's
wish that Jacob should sleep here: God shifts the scenes, alters the lighting,
all for the purpose that the "righteous man should sleep there." There is
a profound intimation here about the dynamics of sleep, about loss of
consciousness and the possible gifts of unconsciousness, about knowing
and dreaming.
Sleep is a one-sixtieth part of death, say the Sages.24 The waking effort
is to know, not to miss any detail, to absorb all knowledge into conscious
cognitive life. To be awake is the modality of the student who dares not
waste a moment. Walter Benjamin writes about Kafka:
"'But when do you sleep?' asked Karl, looking at the student in
surprise. 'Oh, sleep!' said the student. Til get some sleep when I'm
finished with my studies.'" This reminds one of the reluctance with
which children go to bed; after all, while they are asleep, something
might happen that concerns them. . . . While they study, the students
are awake, and perhaps their being kept awake is the best thing about
these studies. The hunger artist fasts, the doorkeeper is silent, and the
students are awake.25
The essence of the students' life, the irrational but necessary  
expression of their artistry, is their wakefulness. One moment's distraction may
cause one to miss the single detail that redeems, that construes the whole.
Driven by the desire for coherence, how dare one yield to the phantasms
of the night? Jacob regrets that during the time he slept, "he was not
aware of himself," and therefore was not engaged in the conscious act of
developing his relationship with God.26 So that, despite the inspiration
and the promises of his dream, Jacob experiences a paradoxical fear, a

Dispersions
191
sense that accompanies any gift of illumination, that one is not large
enough, or live enough, to contain this gift.
Though Jacob's sleep, therefore, is the basic condition for God's
revelation, it also produces a kind of awe, of estrangement. One  
extraordinary motif in the midrashic reading of Jacob's dream is the depiction of
the angels "goingup and down onit [the ladder]" (28:12). In the midrash
in Bereshit Rabbah, the angels are going up and down on Jacob, not on the
ladder:
What can this mean? They are accusing and defending him. They are
pushing him, leaping over him, abusing him—as it is said, "You are My
servant, Israel in whom I glory" [Isaiah 49:3] — "You are the one whose
face is carved out in the worlds above [in the Throne of Glory (Pirkei
d'Rabbi Eliezer)]" The angels go up and see Jacob's face; they come
down and find him sleeping. This is like a king, who would sit in
judgment in his council chamber. His people would go up and see him
there in his dignity; they would then go down and find him in the
corridor, sleeping!27
Jacob is the focus of the angels' activity. He exists both in the higher
worlds —in some ideal, spiritual, and wakeful form —and in the lower
worlds—ungracefully, disgracefully asleep. This duality exercises the
angels considerably. Their vertical movement—up and down—expresses
the contrasts of Jacob's human experience, spiritual and physical. By and
large, the angels are antagonistic: they taunt Jacob, who—sleeping—
expresses the cloddishness, the static insensibility of the body spread-
eagled on the earth, held fast in the grip of gravity.
But God defends Jacob—like a nurse who fans away flies from the
sleeping prince.28 "God was standing beside him" (28:13)— God dispels
all the charges of the angels, simply by being there, standing protectively
over Jacob, endowing Jacob with the strength of knowing His presence.
A certain wordless sense of God redeems the apparent cloddishness of
sleep. For it is sleep and the dream-reverie which sleep generates that
makes Jacob aware of his sleeping self and the movements of the  
querulous angels. He dreams their ascent and descent: he himself is the
ladder29 on which, like a music stave, they try to read the mystery of his
music. He dreams of them, and of himself, and of God. His sleep,
therefore, is far from static:
Our nocturnal life is an ocean because we float in it. In sleep we never
live motionless on the earth. We fall from one sleep into a deeper sleep,

192
VA-YETZE
or something in us wants to wake up: then it causes us to rise. We are
forever rising or falling. Sleep has a vertical dynamic. It oscillates
between sleeping more deeply and less deeply.30
Jacob oscillates between up and down; but as God stands over him to
protect him, a new synthesis is experienced, a still point in the turning
world. The words describing God's "posture" suggest stability,  
unconditional attention and support. Rashi comments simply: "to guard him."
There is much fear in Jacob, a live sense of the whole gamut of  
possibilities in store for him. But God provides reassurance —not by cutting
off the range of oscillation, but by allowing him to experience its full
extent. In a quasi-therapeutic sense, God contains Jacob's vertical agitations.
The ladder is placed toward the earth; its top reaches toward the
heavens (28:12): there are opposing tendencies in man that extend him
endlessly in both directions. But the basis is undoubtedly the earth: the
ladder is placed, with fall intentionality, in the earthly direction,31 and
it is from the earth that the angels begin their agitated movement.
The stability that God, standing over Jacob, promises him, is rooted in
the physical image of the sleeper, his body extended horizontally. "The
ground on which you are lying I will assign to you" (28:13). Rashi gives
the image of the sleeping body immense power: "God folded up the
whole land of Israel beneath him, and hinted that it would be easy for his
children to conquer it as the four cubits that are the space of a human
being."32
To lie down and sleep can apparently be a mode of large conquest. To
sleep in the place where his father was bound in sacrifice can perhaps be
seen as a gesture of defeat, a refusal to confront the terror of the place.33
But God appears to Jacob, as he experiences the full dream-terror, the
oscillation of anger and guilt that the angels project. And Jacob's  
attention is turned, within the dream, on the power of his own sleeping body,
attached to the earth. All that a man may be is compacted within his
trunk, his head, his limbs. The whole land of Israel is his, if he can fill the
proper shape of humanity, if he can body forth the image of God, on
earth.
The vertical and the horizontal: God's promise
The paradox of the vertical and the horizontal is here set into dynamic
motion. The ladder on which the angels ascend and descend is an

Dispersions
193
ironically mechanical prop. For are angels not made to fly? Where are the
essential wings? The stepping movement that must, in the dream,  
connect above with below, the uninspired comparison of the physical and
spiritual faces of Jacob, are a travesty of the buoyant impulse without
which journeys cannot be undertaken. So, in his dream, Jacob rejects the
ladder; and God reveals Himself with a new promise, based on the
promises to Abraham and Isaac, but vitally different:
I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac:
the ground on which you are lying I will assign to you and to your
offspring. Your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall
spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All
the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you and your  
descendants. Remember, I am with you: I will protect you wherever you go
and will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have
done what I have promised you. (28:13-15)
God promises, firstly, the land—but now, as it relates to Jacob's
gravity-held body. His seed "will be as the dust of the earth" —an image
as earthly and gross as can be found. But this "low" image produces the
"bursting," explosive promise of u-faratzta (translated here, "you shall
spread out").34 There is a descent into the concrete reality of the earth,
which will produce enormous force and —ultimately—blessing for the
whole world. In Abraham's blessing, the perspective had been the  
empirical wonder of a childless man having many descendants, of a landless alien
coming to acquire a whole country clearly dominated by another  
civilization.35 Now, however, the wonder of the promise is focused on one body,
lying on the ground, and its force for extension and blessing.
The heart of the promise, however, the new note struck in the history
of God's speeches to man, is the last verse: "Remember, I am with you: I
will protect you wherever you go." Here, on one level, God speaks of ends
to be consummated: Jacob will return from exile, all the promises made
to his fathers will be fulfilled in him. ("All that I have spoken was about
you" reads Rashi. "God had never spoken to Jacob before this" [28:15].
Jacob is the chosen son, to whom all the promises of destiny referred.)
But, essentially, God's message to Jacob goes far beyond this established
pattern. "I [anokhi] am with you": this suggests an energy that will
accompanyjacob constantly through all the vicissitudes of exile. There is
a quality of life promised here —a buoyancy Jacob will experience as he

194
VA-YETZE
walks through the world. By contrast with the angels and their  
compulsive ascent and descent of the ladder, Jacob will go with an extended
anokhi, a sense of self that, mysteriously, will contain God. This will affect
his perspective on the horizontal world, even as he moves outwards
upon it.
Rashi places "I am with you" in the context of Jacob's fear. Afraid of
both Esau and Laban, of past and future, Jacob is to find essential support
in this single phrase. It is not merely that in the end all will be well: it is
that a vitality never before known will now be his. Rashi similarly
translates God's assurance to Moses, as he responds to God's call with
anxious questions ("Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and free the
Israelites from Egypt?"): "I will be with you; that shall be your sign that it
was I who sent you" (Exodus 3:11-12). Rashi: "This is in answer to 'Who
am I . . . ?' It is My mission, not yours [lit., It is not yours but mine] — for I
will be with you."
The promise to "be with" Jacob, as with Moses, reveals an electric
charge in human life, a new sense of God involved in the steps of the
journey. Jacob is no longer entirely his own man: he goes on divine
business. When, at the end of his life, Jacob goes down to Egypt to rejoin
his son, Joseph, God similarly reassures him, "Fear not to go down to
Egypt. ... I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I Myself will
also bring you back" (46:3-4). The midrash comments: "This teaches
that when Israel went down to Egypt, the Divine Presence went down
with them; and when they came up from Egypt, it came up with them."36
The midrash reads the words "with you" as more than a promise of
eventual return to the Holy Land, or redemption from Egypt. God will
accompany Israel in all its troubles, its vicissitudes of Exile and Return, its
vertical oscillation of up and down.
Experientially, the promise to "be with you" translates as a mitigation
of loneliness for the human being moving downwards and upwards, prey
to the contingencies and mutability of destiny. This, in the words of
Ramban, is "a great promise: that he will not be in the hands of the
angels, but will be the portion of God, and God will be with him always"
(28:12). Pulled downwards by the forces of gravity, he will find in himself
a strange buoyancy, a dimension that is not entirely his own.
Jacob hears in God's words a concern for the vulnerability of human
existence that needs protection at every point—"I shall protect you
wherever you go—for I shall not abandon you." In direct response to

Dispersions
195
God's assurance, Jacob vows next morning: "If God will be with me, if He
protects me on this journey that I am making, and gives me bread to eat
and clothing to wear . . ." (28:20). God's protective presence is  
understood by Jacob to refer to the daily needs of existence, food and clothing,
the minutiae of human experience.37 God's care for Jacob is a microscopic
matter: out of a sense of God involved in such concerns arises the
possibility of wholeness. ("And I shall return in peace" [28:21], Rashi:
"In peace [be-shalom]" — whole, unfractured by sin).38
This concern for wholeness, indeed, is Jacob's central concern, and it
is this, essentially, that God addresses in the dream. As Jacob "goes out"
into a world of darkness and exile, order and coherence are endangered.
To sleep in a holy place is to betray an ideal of heroic stability and
consciousness: "If I had known, I should not have slept."
But God wants this sleep. He stage-manages the abrupt darkness so
that Jacob will sleep and dream here. At the heart of the dream will be an
image of his own sleeping body, with angels querulously attacking the
disgrace of his divided self, of the king in his council chamber and asleep
in the corridor. And in all the confusion, the oscillation registered by the
satirical angels, God will stand firmly by him, proclaiming solidarity, a
secret order in the chaos.
Darkness, too, is a way of knowing God. Jacob, who had spent
fourteen years turning night into day, studying Torah, preoccupied with
order and clarity, suddenly "stood up and turned day into night."39 In a
startling moment, the midrash depicts Jacob as disrupting the God-given
order of the world:
"I realized, too, that whatever God has brought to pass will recur
evermore" [Ecclesiastes 3:14]. God's original decree of binary order—
upper worlds and lower, sea and dry land, summer and winter, day and
night—is changed by the righteous. God decreed that day be eternally
day and night eternally night. Jacob stood up and made the day into
night, as it is said, "He extinguished the sun" [kava ha-shemesh, a play
on the words ki ba ha-shemesh — "for the sun had set"].
In this version of the narrative, Jacob has the power to cut across the
binary system that God has instituted as a model congenial to human
thinking. To perceive the world in terms of structural polarities is  
convenient and, in most cases, productive. But the righteous, men and women
of special potency, can shift the boundaries of conventional thinking.

196
VA-YETZE
Suddenly, it is Jacob who makes the sun set, who, after years of turning
night into day, now turns day into night. In doing this, he opens for
himself the treasury of the night: the power of God with him in the
phantasmagoria of the dark.
The classical, the linear, the predictable and reversible: one might say
that these are aspects of Jacob's early life as a "simple man, living in the
tents" (my translation) of Torah, in the harmonious interiors of the
intellect. What begins with the setting of the sun—and this, according to
the midrash we have just cited, on Jacob's own initiative —is a disruption
of these classical structures. God speaks of dust, of explosive movements
outwards in all four directions, while the angels taunt Jacob with the
anomaly of his complex and unpredictable condition. But the turbulence
of the night contains an internal structure: "I am with you. . . . I shall not
abandon you." There is a structure of dynamic process, which is not
known ahead of time. For time bounds ahead of knowledge, as the sun
sets and Jacob finds himself praying a new kind of prayer. Chaos,  
breakdown, disorder contain new possibilities for dynamic structure.
Fusing the stones: an experiment in integration
This night of sleep in a holy place, then, becomes an experiment in
integration. Before sleeping, with a deliberateness that the midrash takes
as experimental, "Jacob took of the stones of that place, he placed them at
his head and lay down in that place" (28:11):
He took twelve stones ["of the stones" suggests more than one stone].
God had decreed that he would raise up twelve tribes. Jacob said:
"Abraham did not raise up twelve tribes, nor did Isaac. But if these
twelve stones unite with one another, I shall know that I shall raise up
twelve tribes." When the stones united with one another ["Jacob woke
in the morning and he took the stone" (28:18)], he knew that he would
raise up twelve tribes.40
The fusing of the stones into one is an almost surrealistic image for
Jacob's central preoccupation. For stones do not fuse; they stubbornly,
stonily preserve their separateness. The enterprise of "raising twelve
tribes" seems similarly incapable of producing unity or harmony. This
impossible task—of creating structure and meaning in the diverse and
the chaotic—is, however, the essentially human act. In a fine, paradoxical

Dispersions
197
sense, the human being—as human being—should be able to raise up
twelve tribes —simply as the creature formed by the hands of God, and
endowed with the unpredictable creativity of God Himself.41 To raise up
twelve tribes is to engage with chaos, with the indeterminate and diverse,
and to create harmony, a wholeness out of difference:
Adam was fit to have twelve tribes rise up from him—as it is written,
"This [zeb] is the book of the children of Adam" (5:1). Zeb has the
numerical value of twelve: twelve should be the number of the progeny
of Adam. God said, "Adam is the work of My hands—should I not give
him twelve tribes?!" But He then said, "When I gave him two sons, one
of them rose up and killed his brother. If I had given him twelve sons,
how much worse it would have been!,, Therefore it is written, "And He
said to Adam [le-Adam]" — "Not Adam! [lo-Adam] I shall not give them
to Adam. To whom shall I give them? To Jacob the righteous."42
The principle of individuality tends toward anarchy; and the number
twelve has mystical implications, a number of maximal diversity. The first
siblings introduce murder into the world. God is not willing to expose
His human creature to this kind of potentially chaotic creativity, unless
He can trust him to read a new order of unity in diversity. Jacob himself
sets up the stones around his head (not as a pillow under his head,
according to midrashic readings).43 He discovers that his head is the focal
point, in which unity and coherence can be construed out of chaos.
It is his head which is endangered by the "wild animals.,,44 Oliver
Sacks writes of the complex, unstable patterns of response exhibited by
his post-encephalitic patients, and of the sense of anxiety and  
helplessness these produced in him. He quotes the chemist Prigogine, facing the
"catastrophe" of the breakdown of symmetry and reversibility in physics,
classical dynamics, and biological systems, at the end of the nineteenth
century: "In some sense, this unlimited predictability is an essential part
of the scientific picture of the physical world. We may perhaps even call it
the founding myth of classical science. ... Is this a defeat for the human
mind? Is this the end of classical thought?"45 It is the human mind and its
daylight structurings of reality that is endangered; and it is the human
mind that sets itself to discern a more complex unity in the apparently
random stream of data.
In a poignant variation on the twelve-stones motif, the midrash in
Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 35, describes the stones as coming

198
VA-YETZE
from the altar on which Isaac his father was bound. . . . And they all
became one stone, to tell Jacob that they were all destined to become
one nation in the land. . . . And in the morning, Jacob sat down to
gather the stones together (and replace them in the altar); and he found
them all one stone, and he set it up as a pillar. . . . What did God do?
He stretched out His right foot [symbolizing eternity] and sank the
stone deep into the earth, as one inserts a keystone into an arch.
Therefore, it is called Even Shetiya—the Foundation Stone of the
world.
From the place of utter fear, Jacob takes stones for his experiment.
Where his father was almost killed, he asks radical questions about the
meaning of the fragments. And a unity is affirmed which is strong enough
to support the structure, not only of the Holy Temple, but, through it, of
the whole world. Elements of primal terror are rebuilt into a basis for
stability: "Did you know, then, that joy is, in reality, a terror whose
outcome we don't fear? We go through terror from beginning to end,
and that precisely is joy. A terror about which you know more than the
beginning. A terror in which you have confidence."46
Rilke intuits the unity of joy and fear. Jacob sleeps in the place of his
father's fear and wakes to fear. But he also wakes to a new sense of his own
strength, his capacity to carry fear to the point of joy. When God blesses
him, "U-faratzta—You shall spread out," Jacob knows that his destiny
involves diffusion, a kind of violent rending of containing structures—
but, also, an intimation of growing, irrepressible vigor.47
Fear and joy, the sense of cracking apart, of dislocation, and, at the
same time, of new power—"I am with you": the paradox of Jacob's
feeling is expressed in an evocative suggestion of Hatam Sofer. When
Jacob "hits the place," there occurs a kind of dislocation; in the words of
the midrash, "He saw the Holy Temple in its state of destruction."48 The
structure of sacrifice and sacred meaning created by Abraham and Isaac is
uncreated in Jacob's experience of the place. He sees it through the prism
of night and exile; the holy place is subtly out of focus, no longer properly
aligned with the sacredness of the upper world. As long as the Holy
Temple remains truly aligned with its counterpart in heaven, Israel's
enemies have no power to enter. Destruction becomes possible when this
true positioning of the earthly structure in relation to its spiritual  
paradigm is lost.49

Dispersions
199
Jacob experiences the moment of catastrophe —the moment of  
profound dislocation which is called exile. In this moment, God speaks to
him of a destiny of diffusion, of apparent formlessness: in the midst of
this, Jacob will travel with God. As in Coleridge's classic distinction
between "mechanical regularity" and "organic form,'' Jacob is given the
power to discover, through the long process called exile, an organic form
in his experience. Such form is "innate; it shapes, as it develops, itself
from within, and the fulness of its development is one and the same with
the perfection of its outward form. Such as the life is, such is the form."50
Fullness and form: there is an obvious tension in the concept. Yet the
stones come together. And Jacob rises up from the place of his dream
with a buoyancy that is subtly expressed in the classic translation of
Targum Jonathan, and in Rashi's commentary on Jacob's motion, after the
dream: "And Jacob lifted up his legs" (29:1, my translation). The Targum
adds an adverb, "lightly"; Rashi quotes the midrash, "Since Jacob had
been given good news ... his heart lifted up his legs and he became light
on his feet."51 The sense of lightness and freedom gives Jacob a physical
sensation, almost a sensation of flying.
J\tr and dreams: the imagination of movement
The extraordinary aspect of this midrashic description of Jacob's  
response to the "good news" of the dream is its physical, dynamic nature.
The midrash on which Rashi bases his reading begins with a text from
Proverbs: "A calm disposition gives bodily health" (14:30). Where the
spirit is at ease, the body becomes light and free, a dreamlike ethereal
nature is restored. The body is integrated, moves with an elan, a "really
substantiated lightness involving the whole being . . . only the slightest
impulse is needed to activate the lightness that pervades his whole being.
It is easy and very simple: striking the heel lightly on the ground gives us the
impression of being set free."52
In his book, Air and Dreams, Gaston Bachelard explores images of
flying, in dream or waking reverie. He refers to the "first thesis of
Nietzschean Aesthetics": "What is good is light; whatever is divine
moves on tender feet."53
In an extraordinary way, the midrashic focus on Jacob's feet illustrates
Bachelard's thesis. He writes: "Gravity is a very human psychic law. It is a
part of us. It is a destiny that we must overcome, and those who have an

200
VA-YETZE
aerial temperament foresee this victory in reverie."54 "A human being, in
his youth, in his taking off, in his fecundity, wants to rise up from the
earth. The leap is a basic form of joy."55
Jacobs feet, in midrashic sources, become a symbol for the conflict of
lightness and gravity. Lugubriously, the midrash illustrates the theme of
the defeat of lightness, youth, and joy: " 'The race is not won by the swift
[lit., the light]_ [Ecclesiastes 9:11]: This refers to Jacob. Yesterday, 'Jacob
lifted up his feet'; today, 'he gathered his feet into the bed_ (49:3 3)."56
Gravity wins in the end, the retrenching, the concentration. But the
midrash invests much dynamic imagination in Jacob's buoyancy, in the
integration of body and spirit that is the greatest gift of the dream, and
that is expressed as a form of flight.
The midrashic tradition conveys the ease, the lightness with which
Jacob moves the immovable stone on the well, as he arrives at his
destination: " 'You will walk without breaking stride; When you run, you
will not stumble' [Proverbs 4:12]. Jacob's steps were not constricted, nor
did his strength fail, but like a mighty hero, he rolled off the stone from
the mouth of the well."57 Fatigue does not drag him down, nor does
vertigo dizzy him; he covers enormous ground, as though wearing seven-
league boots. The classical midrashic assertion that "the ground shrank
for Jacob," so that he was suddenly transferred to Haran, is understood in
mystical sources as referring to the prodigious high-stepping power of
Jacob's walk: his legs become longer and his steps — literally fulfilling the
terms of the quotation from Proverbs — become widened.58 Light and
wide-striding, Jacob is, in effect, almost flying: he is a long-distance
runner who gains strength and speed by stepping lightly. (In Hugh
Hudson's film, Chariots of Fire, the Jewish runner, Harold Abrahams,
practices a tip-toe run to increase buoyancy and stamina.)
The desire to fly is born of the paradoxical "good news" of Jacob's
dream: what was focused but static is to be refracted and dynamic. The
movement is to be horizontal — u-faratzta, "You shall spread out" — close
to the surface of the earth, like its dust, like the sleeping Jacob, embedded
in soil and stones. But the imagery of Jacob's feet suggests the paradox of
the foot: the basis of stability, and at the same time dynamic, with a
complex motion in which the vertical and horizontal interact.
In order to move, one separates the unity of the leg-"pedestal." What
drives one to separate, to disperse the coherent strength of the standing
position? "At a time of hunger, scatter [pazzer] your legs," writes the

Dispersions
201
Yalkut Shimoni, about the journey into exile of later travelers —Naomi
and Elimelech at the beginning of the Book of Ruth.59 Such scattering is
resonant throughout biblical and midrashic texts with nuances of  
attenuation, fruitlessness, dissipation of energy,60 poverty,61 and death.62 And
yet this diffusion is apparently the right response to hunger. One must
travel far and wide to seek what one hungers for. A certain static dignity
has to be relinquished. Jacob responds to his fate with a long-legged leap,
inspired by the knowledge that in his "walking," God is with him: "I shall
be with you, wherever you walk [lit.]."
He almost flies. Space shrinks in the buoyancy of his motion. But his
steps remain earthbound; we hear the heel strike the ground, which
"gives power to anyone who rebounds from it."63
There is a richness in the earth that gives resilience to Jacob as he goes
into exile. His motion, vertical and horizontal at once, has a paradoxical
superiority to that of the angels, who can only step up or down the rungs
of the ladder at one time. Angels are meant to fly: but in Jacob's dream,
they are restricted to the stepping space of the ladder, careful, gradual,
perhaps cramped. What Jacob experiences is the power and resilience of
his whole being, enriched by the rebound of the earth.
Jacob takes off(va-yetze) as he leaves his parents' home. Fear of exile, of
that scattering of his energy and will that is the inner meaning of exile
(pezzura is one of the terms for exile) is transformed through his dream
into an acceptance that lends wings to his feet and fecundity to body
and mind.
This energy, in itself, is the pure sensation, as the midrash imagines it,
of "I shall be with you." It accompanies him in exile, and brings  
prosperity, not only to himself, but to Laban as well. Using an unusual metaphor,
Jacob tells Laban: "God has blessed you le-ragli [lit., through my feet]
because of me" (30:30). Rashi reads: "As a result of my feet coming to
you, blessing has come to you." Rambam understands this as a phrase of
causation: "because of me."64 Rashi, too, seems to take the reference to
Jacob's feet simply as a synecdoche: "with me came blessing."
But there is a more imaginative thematic understanding of the foot
motif in Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer. Laban's flocks fell to a plague before
Jacob's arrival. Jacob nurtures the remaining sheep—"and God blessed
them because of my feet": "Do Jacob's feet have the power to increase the
fertility of Laban's sheep? From here, the Sages said that sometimes a
person's foot brings blessing to a house, while sometimes it brings ruin—

202
VA-YETZE
and Jacob's foot brought blessing."65 Jacob's presence in Laban's house
brings a vitality, a buoyancy, that is the sensed reality of "I am with you."
The sleeping body of Jacob, dreaming in the holy place, becomes instinct
with vigor. For it is, according to the midrasfr, the very site of God's
presence: wherever the righteous are, there He is.
Jacob in Padan Aram: fullness and form
The problem of integration, of the coordination of feet, hands, head, and
trunk, still remains with Jacob. Four wives, thirteen children, and  
enormous wealth present problems in administration, in husbandry, in the
fullest sense. But the narrative itself and midrashic and hasidic literature
give us a Jacob who is extended to his ripest contours. To quote Coleridge
again: perfection of form is a process that is organic and innate; "it
shapes, as it develops, itself from within." As the full human being,
seeking life and wholeness, Jacob is portrayed in terms of such process. It
is a history of continual discovery: of error and correction, of "makings
and matchings,"66 as Jacob struggles for a true perception of the world.
The psychology of visual representation, for example, is indicated by
the use of the simple word Ve-hine ("and behold"), which recurs  
constantly through the Jacob narrative.67 This gives us a Jacob whose field of
perception is always changing, sharpening its focus. The unpredictable
shocks of present time inform Jacob's world. The word puts the reader
behind Jacob's eyes, experiencing the movement of his perceptions. No
system blunts the startling quality of each encounter in the world of exile.
Jacob's process of integration begins with real fear at the possible
disintegration of the anokhi—the self—under the pressures of "poverty,
sickness and malevolent foreigners."68 When God promises him  
protection against these erosions of his identity, the words, "And behold I
[anokhi] am with you," can be read as an assurance that God's anokhi, with
all its resources, is available to Jacob, in his vicissitudes. In his dream, he is
assured of energy and integrity. And when he wakes, he experiences the
buoyancy of his feet and strength of his hands, as he rolls the stone off the
well. His body wakes and discovers its power. "The hands are the hands of
Esau," Isaac said, feeling the Esau-potential in Jacob's arms (27:22). For
Jacob to have strong arms is clearly to mark a new sense of integration:
what he knows, what he sees, he can perform in the world.

And yet, when he sees Rachel, the beloved, for the first time, he weeps.
These tears—the first in the Torah narrative—are mysterious. "Then
Jacob kissed Rachel, and broke into tears" (29:11). He kisses her, and
cries. There is even a similarity between the two verbs, Va-yishak and Va-
yevk: beginning and end of the sentence echo each other. What is the
quality of this moment, of these enigmatic tears?
Rashi brings together two views from the midrash:
"And broke into tears": Because he foresaw, through sacred inspiration,
that Rachel would not be buried together with him. Also: because he
had come with empty bands. He said, "Eliezer, my father's servant, had
in bis bands rings and bracelets and delicacies, while I—I have nothing in
my hands" This happened because Eliphaz, the son of Esau, pursued
him, at the command of his father, to kill him. When he caught up with
him, he [lit.] pulled back bis band from killing him, since he had grown
up in Isaac's bosom. He said, "But what shall I do about my father's
command?" And Jacob told him, "Take what is in my hands—for the
poor person is accounted as though dead."
In both readings, Jacob's tears are connected with death. On the one
view, he cries because of his love for Rachel, and because of their eventual
separation: not only death, but even burial will divide them. There is an
anguish at the very heart of love —the "invisible worm," of which Blake
writes ("O Rose, thou art sick!"). On the second view, he cries because he
is "as though dead." His poverty, the emptiness of his hands, declares a
loss of autonomy, of the power to do what he wills. Jacob, in effect, cries
about the two central concerns of a human life, according to Freud: love
and work. As he enters Laban's world, he intuits the profound conflicts
that will inform both these concerns.
Work : power and authenticity
On the most basic level, work is a necessity for one who is poor, who has
"nothing in his hands." These hands, that have just now freely and
proudly demonstrated their strength in rolling the stone off the well,
suddenly hang limp. "The poor man is like a dead man," say the Sages.
And Maharal explains: The poor man lacks an essential autonomy; he
depends on others for his sense of life. There is a "fountain of life" that
should flow from the self, unconditioned by the will of others. Without
this organic independence, a person is "as though dead."

204
VA-YETZE
A humiliating impotence is Jacob's sensation, even as he kisses Rachel,
after the triumph of his achievement at the well. Something vital to his
full being is eroded by poverty. He must work. Jacob is, indeed, the first
worker in the Torah. He is also the first lover. That is, he is the first
person to be specifically described as wed and ohev, engaged in physical
labor, and —before marriage — loving a woman.
The incidence of the word wed, "work," in this narrative, is very high.
Jacob works, primarily, to fill his hands: to acquire a sense of personal
power and autonomy. But he works for Laban, he must submit to the
power of an employer, who tries to prevent that "filling," that autonomy,
from ever happening. Ultimately, after all Jacob's work, he says: "Had
not the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac,
been with me, you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God took
notice of my plight and the toil of my hands" (31:42). It is God who has
protected Jacob's hands and their labor: Laban would have sent them
away empty as they came. Because God was "with" him (lit., Had not
God been to me —mine), he was able to take full responsibility for any
losses incurred by Laban (lit., from my hand, you would exact it [31:39]).
The labor of twenty years is an expenditure of energy—first for Laban,
and only afterwards for himself (30:30). His hands ultimately build his
own empire; but for the first fourteen years, he serves Laban. The word
wed is used constantly with Laban as object: essentially, Jacob serves, he
slaves for Laban, he is not his own master. The result is paradoxical:
through twenty years of labor, Jacob serves his master well; but in doing
so, he also discovers his own power. "You know," he says to Laban, "what
services I have rendered you" (30:26). And again: "You know how well I
have served you" (30:29). And again, to his wives: "You know I have
served your father with all my might" (31:6). As Jacob speaks of  
knowledge in connection with labor, he comes progressively to appropriate for
himself the right to his own labor. He knows himself and his own
strength; he is intensely aware of "all his might," precisely because he has
acquired it through long years of subjugation. His hands have become a
conscious expression of his power, of the fountain of life that springs
freely within him.
Jacob's success is conveyed in terms of material prosperity: "And the
man became very prosperous [Vayifrotz]" — a clear fulfillment, on the
economic level, of God's promise, "And you shall spread out [U-fa-

Dispersions
205
ratzta]" (28:14). Jacob's vitality is expressed in a thickening envelope of
property: of things belonging to him, attached to him.
The simple idiom that conveys the idea of property in biblical Hebrew—
Va-yehi lo (lit., and there was to him) —for the first time in the Torah
narrative becomes a central motif. Literally, if inelegantly, translated, the
idiom leaves its traces throughout these chapters. "The man became very
prosperous, and there were to him large flocks, maidservants and menser-
vants, camels and asses" (30:43). Laban's sons claim, "Jacob has taken all
that was our father's" (31:1). Rachel and Leah affirm: "Truly, all the
wealth that God has taken away from our father is to us and to our children"
(31:16). Laban, in a tantrum, finally reveals his true colors: "The  
daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my
flocks; all that you see is to me" (31:43). Jacob sends messages to his
brother, Esau, narrating his success: "and there were to me cattle, asses,
sheep" (32:6). He also commands his servants to answer Esau, when he
asks, "To whom are you? And to whom are those in front of you?": "Toyour
servanty to Jacob —they are a gift sent to my lord, to Esau" (32:19). And
Esau grants Jacob undisputed rights over his own property, with the
words, "There is to me much — let what is to you be to you" (3 3:9). By contrast,
Jacob, who has experienced a night of lonely conflict with a mysterious
foe, is able to reply: "There is to me everything" (33:11).
Jacob has expanded his personal power, his control over things and
people who are in significant relation to him. But, in doing this, he has
incurred all the dangers and jealousies attendant on success. He is the
first "self-made man" in the Bible — "With my staff alone I crossed this
Jordan, and now I have become two camps" (32:11). Solitary and poor,
thin as a stick, he began his journey. Dense and complex, his identity is
spelled out in wives, children, sheep, cattle, when he returns. But before
he confronts Esau, he strips himself: all that belongs to him he places at
the other side of the river. In an act of evacuation, he "crosses them over,"
a displacement, as though to make room for something else. "And Jacob
was left alone" (32:24-2 5). He now has room for his loneliness; gently, he
has removed all that he has attached to himself. After such a night, he can
say to Esau; "I have everything."
Through his work, then, Jacob acquires, essentially, the energy in his
arms and legs. Alone, he can wrestle—arms and legs entwined—with an
angel. The hazards of the night, of exile, however, are a factor in this work
and this wealth. Perhaps these can be seen most poignantly in Jacob's

206
VA-YETZE
reference to Laban's changing face: "And Jacob saw that Laban's face was
not with him, as it had been in the past" (31:2). Laban's face is "with"
Jacob; but later, he repeats to his wives that "Laban's face is not 'to' me, as
it was previously" (31:5). Laban's face is part of Jacob's world; he carries
its impress, its changing looks around with him. It is part of the  
"envelope" of his life. Laban's smiles and frowns affectjacob, even as he affirms
that the stability of "the God of my father has been with me."
For to worker someone is to make oneself vulnerable, dependent on
approval for one's fundamental sense of self. It is this dependence on the
face of another that Jacob has to confront in his "service" of Laban.
Literally, he has "left his father's face" (27:30): that, too, had its terrors
for him ("I shall be in his eyes as a trickster" [27:12]), but nevertheless it
expressed the noble expectations of his home. Now, it is to the changing
moods of a Laban that he must accommodate.
This relation to Laban's face represents a profound challenge to
Jacob's integrity. The Talmud in Berakhot 6b speaks of the debilitating
effect of dependence on others: "When a person is needy of people, his
face changes like a kroomy as it is said, 'One who humiliates himself before
people is like a kroom' [Psalms 12:9]. What is a kroom? There is a bird in
the seaboard cities whose name is kroom. When the sun rises, it turns
many colors." Like the kroom bird, one who is too much affected by
others' faces finds his own face turning all colors, blushing and paling in
response to their changing expressions.
R. Nahman of Bratzlav discusses this passage.69 For him, what is at
issue here is personal authenticity. Someone who is "needy of others" —
financially, or in terms of self-esteem—will find it very difficult to pray
with the community. He will be excruciatingly aware of the gaze of
others, which will induce a fatal self-consciousness in him. His prayers
will then become affected, marked with theatrical expressions, in order
to please and impress others. His face will lose its natural coloring:
chameleonlike, he will respond to the imagined expectations of others.
With great subtlety, R. Nahman describes the effects of emotional
dependence: the false complexity that replaces the simple expression of
the integrated self. At its truest, that is what the human face represents —
a forceful integration of the authentic self that can confront other selves,
other faces, without fear or favor.
This is the challenge that Jacob faces, in his relation to Laban. He
must acquire strong hands, but not at the expense of his face. R. Nahman

quotes: "Grant truth to Jacob" [Micah 7:20]; and "Such is the circle of
those who turn to Him, Jacob, who seek Your presence" (Psalms 24:6).
He reads: those who seek God's face seek the Jacob face in themselves—
the authentic human face of one who struggles for truth. And he finishes
his discussion with a reading of Psalms 146:2: "I shall praise God with my
life." When one is needy of others' approval, one does not live from the
sources of one's own life. Such a person's life is not life, say the Sages70 —
not authentic life. Only one who has freed himself of such needs can truly
pray to God: "I shall praise God with my life."
Jacob's authentic life is constantly threatened by his relation to Laban.
The truth of his own face must survive the necessary masks of an
alienated existence. This is one of the radical tensions of exile, of work/w\*
another. If Jacob's face survives, his truth will be the stronger, perhaps.
But this reality of work is the reality of a post-Eden world. When Adam
was originally placed in the Garden, his brief was to "work it and to tend
it" (2:15). The two verbs (avad and shamar) are identical to those  
systematically used of Jacob, as he works by day and "watches" by night. The
idyllic situation of the Garden made an organic nurturing and self-
nurturing activity of work. But the reality of Jacob's life in exile—doubly
alienated from paradisal simplicity—is one of conflict, threatened  
integrity, jealousies, and resentments.
L^ove: union and separation
Similarly, in relation to that other main human concern—love—the
paradise model only seems to throw the reality of Jacob's life into higher
relief. For Eve was made of Adam's rib; and Adam said, "This time, bone
of my bone" (2:23). Only this time is the full organic unity of man and wife
to be achieved. They are, literally, of the same body: Adam recognizes a
part of himself restored to him—transformed, visible, but intimately his.
Other love stories will contain memories, intimations perhaps of this
primal unity. But separate identities and viewpoints will make for a
tension that will complicate the desired union.71
Jacob is, in a sense, the first lover in the Torah narrative. By this, I
mean that he aspires to an ideal, all-consuming love. Isaac is also of course
described as loving his wife (24:67), but this is a love of marriage, of
comfort after bereavement. Jacob, on the other hand, loves Rachel from
the moment he sees her. "And when Jacob saw Rachel . . .Jacob went up

208
VA-YETZE
and rolled the stone off the mouth of the well" (29:10). Jacob's feat with
the stone on the well is clearly inspired by the sight of Rachel: his kiss and
his tears express an intensity that is not explained in the text. Rashi, as we
have seen, speaks of a love that foresees its own ultimate frustration. Jacob
desires eternal union with Rachel, and in the very moment when desire is
born, he knows that he will be separated from her, by death and burial.
It is a strange passion that brings Jacob to tears. Who would think of
the grave at the moment of live encounter? Jacob lives in that moment the
full paradox of union and separation that will characterize his whole
relation to Rachel. She will be his, but not as he imagined. There will be
"also" Leah, and Bilhah, and Zilpah. He will love her, but his love will
generate jealousy and hatred in his household, now and in generations to
come. And, ultimately, they will be buried apart.
The knowledge that full unity cannot be achieved is like a sword
between them. It is in this sense that Jacob is the first lover in the Torah—
in the European, romantic sense, in which a central component of
passion is unattainability.72 From the tales of courtly love, knightly
adventures engaged in for the sake of the beloved, a notion of self-
validation through love has emerged. Prominent in such tales is the
theme of the impossible, even illicit, love, whose fire burns stronger for
the taboo. Both themes —work for the sake of love, and frustration as a
catalyst of passion — inform the story of Jacob and Rachel.
The connection between work and love is made lucidly in the famous
description of Jacob's courtship: "So Jacob served seven years for Rachel
and they seemed to him but a few days because of his love for her" (29:20).
Jacob has already demonstrated the energy that the sight of Rachel has
released in him, when he rolled the stone off the well. In a sense, the
whole of Jacob's experience in the darkness of exile is an inquiry into the
relation of desire, frustration, and action. When Jacob "works for Rachel,"
the verb avad is used without the usual suffix or object that denotes his
employee status with Laban— "I have served you." Here, instead,  
"working for Rachel" [be-Rahel\ expresses the energy source of his work, its
purpose and motivation. The be- prefix conveys a sense almost of the
saturation of the work with the idea of Rachel. Because the work is
inspired by desire, time goes fast. In a state of high vitality, he drives
toward the accomplishment of his desire; his arms become stronger, and
the society he has adopted becomes wealthier.

As when the sun set early at the beginning of his journey, and as when
the ground shrank under his leaping feet, after his dream, so during this
period of his life Jacob experiences the "shrinking" of time, in relation to
human buoyancy and will. There is a strength that is connected with
desire—a taut-limbed sense, sleepless, highly articulated: "The hunger
artist fasts, the doorkeeper is silent, and the students are awake" —
and Jacob works and watches for Rachel. Perhaps, in the same way as
Benjamin suggests that the students' being kept awake is the best
thing about their studies, Jacob's working and watching is the best thing
about his love.
Even on the level of animal husbandry, a point is made in the narrative
about this connection of strength and desire. Jacob's strategy for  
increasing his wealth is described thus: "Moreover, when the sturdier animals
were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the troughs, in full view of the
animals, so that they mated by the rods" (30:41). The word translated
here, "sturdier," mekusharot, is derived by Ramban from the word, kesher,
meaning "bond, relationship." The males, writes Ramban, were "bound
by desire" to the females: the young born of such matings are called the
"bound ones." Ramban also cites a view that the sturdier animals have a
taut-limbed vigor, which is related to good health and strong desire.
The compulsion of desire — "His own life is boundup with his" (44:30)
is the later description of Jacob's love for Benjamin—gives a clearly erotic
focus to Jacob's working courtship of Rachel. At the end of seven years, he
says to Laban, with almost brutal directness: "Give me my wife ... so
that I may come in to her" (29:21). He wants, in the fullest sense, to come
home. And he is cheated by Laban: Leah replaces Rachel under the
wedding canopy. On the surface, the deception is not tragic: after the
elapse of seven days, he marries Rachel; the work and the desire come to
their fulfillment. But in reality, a wholeness has been fractured.
\\Mchel: barrenness and prayer
Jacob is now married to two women: a storm of emotion—hatred,  
jealousy—replaces the calm harbor of fulfillment. And a profound  
frustration underlies the relationships between Jacob and his two wives. Leah
loves Jacob —names her children as a record of her changing relation to
her husband; Jacob loves Rachel; while Rachel's main passion is for
children. Essentially, all the protagonists most want what they cannot

210
VA-YETZE
have. In this sense, the compulsion of desire continues to drive them,
even after the apparent resolution of marriage.
The only recorded dialogue between Jacob and Rachel can perhaps be
read in the light of such an understanding of the dynamics of desire and
frustration. Jacob is strangely angry with Rachel, when she begs for his
help in "giving her children": "And Rachel said to Jacob, 'Give me
children, or I shall die/ Jacob was incensed at Rachel, and said, 'Can I take
the place of God, who has denied you fruit of the womb?'" (30:1-2).
Rachel cries for children, "or I shall die." Literally, the Hebrew
translates as "or / am dead." Rashi, quoting the midrash, writes: "One
who has no children is accounted as dead."73 Seforno quotes from Isaiah
56:3: "I am a withered tree." Both commentators understand Rachel not
to be having a feminine tantrum — threatening her husband with dire
consequences, if he does not "give" her children.74 Rather, she is simply
describing a dull meaninglessness, a loss of sap in her life. And Jacob's
anger becomes comprehensible. It is painful for him to hear his wife—
whom he loves for herself, not as a means for procreation75 — declare so
plainly that her primary passion is not for him.
Rashi reads his apparently callous reply: "You say that I should do as
my father did—pray for you. But I am not like my father: he had no
children, while I do have children. It is you He has denied, not me"
In Rashi's reading, the callousness of Jacob's answer seems, if  
anything, exacerbated. Jacob seems to proclaim his satisfaction, his lack of
involvement in Rachel's pain. But perhaps Jacob speaks out of the anger
of a man whose love meets with poor response. On one level, he is simply
saying that his life would be amply fed by his relationship with her: her
deprivations are different from his and must inform her own personal
relationship with God.
In this scene, as in the scene where Jacob weeps on meeting Rachel,
Rashi emphasizes the midrashic statements about life conditions that are
"accounted as deathly." Poverty and childlessness: in an emotional sense,
these are the two life-threatening conditions. In a Torah portion that deals
with the question of energy, Rashi reads the paradoxes of desire and
frustration. Poverty drives Jacob to work and prosperity in an alienated
world; childlessness drives Rachel to authentic prayer and fertility: "Now
God remembered Rachel; God heeded her and opened her womb"
(30:22).76

211
L^eab: the dynamic imagination
Leah, by contrast, is patently unloved by Jacob — and, therefore, given
children: "The Lord saw that Leah was unloved and he opened her
womb" (29:31). The balance of frustration and desire is translated into an
"unromantic" fertility. Leah names her children for her wistful, ever-
hopeful pain: "The Lord has seen my affliction. . . . Now my husband
will love me. . . . The Lord heard that I was unloved. . . . This time my
husband will become attached to me. . . ." (29:32-34).
Her relationship with Jacob is, essentially, an act of will; for, in some
enigmatic sense, it was never meant to be. Even before Jacob arrives on
the scene, midrashic tradition asserts she was destined to marry Esau:
familial and social consensus had allocated her to her elder cousin. Her
anguished protest at her fate is expressed in her "weak eyes" — reddened
from weeping:
"Leah had weak eyes" [29:17]: This is to her credit. She would hear
people talking at the crossroads: "Rebecca has two sons, and Laban has
two daughters—the elder daughter will marry the elder son, the  
younger daughter the younger son." She sat at the crossroads, asking: "The
elder son—what kind of person is he?" "A bad person, a robber." "And
the younger son—what kind of person is he?" "A mild man, who sits in
the tents of Torah." And she cried till her eyelashes fell off.77
"Everyone said, the elder daughter will marry the elder son" (Rashi):
there is a destined quality, a kind of fitness about the matches projected
between the two sets of cousins. In some sense, Leah really belongs to
Esau. Another version of the midrash in fact reads, "Leah was fit to marry
none but Esau."78 In this version, she cries in protest: " 'Rachel and I both
came out of one womb —and Rachel is going to marry the righteous
Jacob, while I marry the wicked Esau!' And she wept, till her eyes became
weak."
In effect, Leah defies her fate. She refuses to accept the "fit" marriage.
Sitting at the "crossroads," where destinies fork, she interrogates her
fate, demands to know the implications and consequences of what "must
be." Her tears generate her many children. For a formidable energy
builds up in her, in her deprivation; she takes RachePs place under the
marriage canopy; and in the darkness, in which forms and structures
become fluid, in which transformations, fantastic combinations, and
splittings become possible, Leah becomes Rachel.79

212
VA-YETZE
"When morning came, there [ve-hine—behold!] was Leah!" (29:25).
Rashi comments: But at night she was not Leah. The effect of ve-hine is to
convey a real jolt of perception. Jacob had experienced her during the
night as Rachel: "But I called you 'Rachel,' and you answered me!"80
Leah had found in herself the potential to be Rachel And when, in this
devastatingly ironic midrash, she replies: "But did your father not call you
'Esau/ and you answered him!" she re-evokes in Jacob the power of his
old desire to be other, to reappropriate the qualities projected on the rival
brother.
Essentially, Leah tells Jacob that there are other possibilities of  
relationship than that of idyllic, total love. There is the dynamic imagination,
through which Jacob becomes Esau, Leah becomes Rachel.81 There is
the world of the night, in which shadow selves, maskings, word plays
baffle and fascinate the dreamer. Both Jacob and Leah play their fuller
selves: they are both audacious actors in the poretz mode. U-faratzta—
"You shall spread out" God commanded/promised Jacob in his dream.
Va-yifrotz —And the man did indeed burst through the boundaries of a
simple prescribed identity. He extended his register in all directions.
Leah simply invites him to recognize her as a fellow spirit in the world of
the night.
The marriage of Leah and Jacob, therefore, represents one type of
possible marriage, the type that is characterized by children, by the
multiple consequences of a complex self-knowledge. This is Rashi's
concept of "one flesh": the child, the fruit of two people struggling to
understand who they may be, singly and together. Even in his anger, even
in the "hate" that the narrative ascribes to him, Jacob looks at his
children and says, "The mother of these —can I divorce her?"82 The
children represent possible "makings and matchings" of self and other:
possible integrations of parts of himself that Leah has mirrored back to
him. There is no divorcing the source of such intimations.
Jacob's house: fractured perspectives
Jacob and Leah are buried together. The irony is manifest. The  
struggling, complex couple, with their many children, remain forever together
in the Cave of Makhpelah, the Cave of Couples; while Rachel, the only
true wife of intention and desire, is buried separately, on the road to
Bethlehem.

Dispersions
213
Sadly, Jacob remembers, at the end of his life: "I, when I was returning
from Padan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, while I was journeying in the land
of Canaan, when still some distance short of Ephrath; and I buried her
there on the road to Ephrath,, (48:7). A relationship that began with tears
of foreboding at the ultimate separation of himself and Rachel ends as he
explains to Joseph, the son of that marriage, why this separation was
necessary.
Rashi penetrates the unspoken layers of dialogue:
"I buried her there": I did not even take her to Bethlehem, bring her into
the Holy Land, proper. I know you resent this. But know that it was at
the command of God that I buried her there, so that she might be a
help to her children. When Nebuchadnezzar will send them into exile,
and they pass her grave, "there, on the road," Rachel will come out of
her grave and cry and ask for mercy for them— as it is said, "A cry is
heard in Ramah—wailing, bitter weeping—Rachel weeping for her
children. She refuses to be comforted for her children, who are gone.
Thus said the Lord: Restrain your voice from weeping, your eyes from
shedding tears; for there is a reward for your labor— declares the Lord:
they shall return from the enemy's land. And there is hope for your
future — declares the Lord: your children shall return to their country"
[Jeremiah 31:14-16].
Jacob explains to Joseph why Rachel—with whom he desired nothing
more than to be "one flesh," in Ramban's understanding of the concept:
total and eternal union, without conflict or variation—had to be buried
"there, on the road," in an alienated wayside grave on the boundary of the
Holy Land. At that border place, her eternal yearning for her children
will generate redemptive force. Her tears will win a response from God:
her children will not disappear into the night. Through the sheer power
of her yearning for her children, "who are not" (lit., who are gone), and
practiced by much longing for children, who were not, Rachel will bring
them back into real, coherent being.
Maharal adds a poignant note. Why, he asks, does Rachel weep more
that the other mothers of the exiled children of Israel? He quotes a
midrash, in which Rachel protests to God:
"What have my children done, that You have brought such  
punishment upon them? If it is because they worship idols—which are called
tzarah—a rival wife—then consider my case. I loved my husband,

214
VA-YETZE
Jacob, and he worked seven years for me, and, in the end, my father
gave him my sister as a wife, and I suppressed my love for my husband,
and gave my sister the code words. I am flesh and blood, while You are a
compassionate King— how much more should you have pity on them!,,
And God acknowledges the truth of her words: "There is reward for
your labor."83
Maharal understands this midrash as RachePs most personal, most
philosophical reading of reality. The world is not a coherent, integrated
world. Such unity as would be symbolized by Jacob's marriage to Rachel
is an ultimate, messianic vision. Jacob must marry two wives, because his
"house" must represent a truth about existence in this world, the truth of
fractured perspectives. Rachel accepts this truth, though it defaces the
purity of her love, with love. Such an acceptance puts her on the high
moral ground: can God not similarly accept with love an Israel who sins
because of that inherent defect, that lack of clear coherence, with which
God Himself has fashioned the world? Rachel sees the separation in her
married life, the frustration of total unity, as an indication of the nature of
things. She alone, therefore, has the power to ask God for mercy.
In this reading, Maharal cuts to the heart of Jacob's tragic experience.
Everything in his life is shaped by the threat of a breakdown of desired
form. The integrated harmony of his vision is diffracted into pieces with
jagged edges. Reality reveals itself to him in the sharp, successive,  
provisional images of ve-bine . . . ve-bine . . . ("Behold . . . behold . . ."); of
gam . . . gam . . . ("also . . . also . . ."). Perception changes reality from
moment to moment.
This is, Maharal says, a world of perud— of disjunction: Jacob and
Rachel live that perud bravely, with imagination, with awareness that
through the disjunctions, through the catastrophic shards, anokhi im-
kba — u\ am with you." There is an inner architecture, which only the
desirous imagination can fathom. Through the imagery of physical
buoyancy and strength, of flight, sleeplessness, and unfulfilled desire,
Jacob traces the outlines of a human profile—of head, trunk, arms, legs,
and face —the person in the image of God, alive "with his own life-''
Lranslating pain into strength
Exile, dislocation, and disjunction are not, it seems, absolute states. They
hold at their heart the seed of unity, coherence, and continuity. For— as

Dispersions
215
Galileo asserted of the physical planet—"Nevertheless—in spite of  
everything—it moves": there is a constant process of change, a shifting of
the patterns, which, paradoxically, tends to order. Rachel, buried in "no
place," on the wayside, in the volatile, ever-changing world of her exiled
children, has the power to generate their reintegration and return.
Rachel dies in childbirth. In one sense, this is a most poignant example
of fragmentation and absurdity: to be cut off at the very beginning of
creativity, just as new life breaks into the world. And, in fact, she calls her
baby, Ben-oni, "the son of my sorrow." "But his father called him, Ben-
yamin—the son of my strength" (35:18).84 On the face of it, the child is
named twice, to record the anguish of his dying mother, and the virile
triumph of his father.
But Ramban suggests a different reading. He notes that all the  
children of Jacob were named by their mothers. Jacob does not rename the
child; he translates the word, oni, to mean, "goodness and strength."
Responding to an enigmatic expression in Bereshit Rabbah\*5 — "the child's
father named him Ben-yamin, in the Holy Tongue" — Ramban writes:
"Jacob translated Rachel's language into goodness."
Jacob is the translator, the one who senses the ambiguous, changing
meanings of language. The word oni in Hebrew means both pain and
strength. It is the very nature of holiness to translate pain into strength—
even to intuit the strength within the pain, the coherence within chaos.
It is for this purpose, perhaps, that Jacob goes abroad: in order to
become a translator, to speak the Holy Tongue, his mother tongue, with
a new awareness of its complexity. For though he has learned the  
language of his exile—the apparendy unequivocal language of pain and
alienation—he brings this knowledge to a fullness of experience, in which
it reveals its "holiness," to a point at which terror fuses with joy, sorrow
with strength. A skilled translator, he can play with meanings, faithful
both to Rachel's pain and to the integrative energy at the heart of
that pain.

The Quest for Wholeness
^afe return: Gods promise and Jacobs commitment
Jacob returns to the Holy Land, after twenty years' absence. Return
proves to be a complex experience of confrontations, deaths, and  
disasters. His first act as he reenters the Holy Land is to send messengers to his
estranged brother, Esau, parleying for peace and bearing gifts of  
reconciliation. Fearful for his life, he prays to God —the first quoted prayer in
the Torah—and prepares for war. And during the night before meeting
Esau with his four hundred men, Jacob encounters a mysterious "man,"
with whom he wrestles all night, till the sun rises and he limps toward his
brother.
No sooner has he placated his brother than his daughter, Dinah, is
raped by Shekhem, a local prince, and the whole town of Shekhem is
massacred by his vengeful sons Simeon and Levi. Then, Rebecca's nurse,
Deborah — whose presence in Jacob's camp has not previously been
mentioned — dies, and the mourning is marked by the naming of the oak
tree under which she is buried, Allan Bakhut, "the oak of weeping"
(35:8).\* This is followed by the death of Rachel in childbirth, and by the
enigmatic brief narrative, in which Reuben "lay with Bilhah, his father's
concubine. And Israel found out" (35:22).
This brief survey of the tribulations afflicting Jacob on his return to
the Holy Land casts a shadow over God's promise to Jacob, as he left the
land twenty years earlier. In his dream at Beth El, Jacob had heard God
say, "I will bring you back to this land" (28:15). And, on waking, he had
vowed his response to the promise: "If God remains with me, if He
protects me . . . and if I return safe [be-shalom] to my father's house — the
Lord shall be my God. And this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall
be God's abode" (28:20-22). In his vow, Jacob had added be-shalom —
"safe, in peace" —to the words of God's promise: his concept of return
216

The Quest for Wholeness
217
involves an idea of wholeness. Rashi, in fact, reads be-shalom as "intact,
uncontaminated by sin. May I not learn from Laban's ways." Jacob
understood God's promise —read it back to Him—as culminating not
merely in a physically safe return to his country, but in a spiritually
unaffected return to his father's house. He desires a wholeness and a
closing of the circle, as he imagines the end of his exile, and his reabsorp-
tion into his father's house.
There may even be more than a nuance of commitment to Jacob's
hope for the future; possibly, his call for integrity throughout his exile is
part of his vow, and not—as usually read —part of the conditions he lays
down before he will fulfill his vow.2 On such a reading, Jacob takes a
certain responsibility for returning whole, "unspoiled," from his  
wanderings, and, equally, for closing the circle of his travels by returning to
his father's house. He does not merely desire such a return, but sets
himself in full intentionality on a course of preserving a certain original
integrity.
How far does reality consummate God's promise and Jacob's  
intention? As far as integrity is concerned, the text seems to vouch for Jacob
that he does indeed return intact from his travels: "And Jacob arrived safe
[shalem, lit., whole] in the city of Shekhem" (33:18). Rashi here expands
the notion of wholeness to multiple areas of human concern: "Whole in
his body, as he was cured of his limp; whole in his financial resources, as
he lost nothing by his munificent gift to Esau; whole in his Torah, as he
forgot nothing of his learning in Laban's house."
In an acute midrashic play on words, Rashi places Jacob's hidden
concern with integrity in almost surrealistic focus. Jacob sends a message
to Esau, in which he speaks of his "sojourn" (garti) with Laban: garti
expresses a way of seeing his time in Laban's house as provisional,
temporary.3 Rashi quotes a classic midrash: "Garti has the same  
numerical value as taryag—the 613 commandments: 'I sojourned with Laban,
but I kept all 613 commandments, and did not learn from Laban's
ways.'" In other words, he encodes in his message to his brother what he
feels to be his real strength —the fact that his identity has remained
unaffected by all his vicissitudes.
If, however, we examine more closely the midrash quoted by Rashi, in
which wholeness — physical, financial, and intellectual — is unpacked
from the word shalem (33:18), an implicit tension is exposed at each level
of the description. Physical health is a matter of having been injured — the

218
VA-YISHLAH
limp with which Jacob emerges from his night of wrestling with the man-
angel— and of having been cured of his injury. Financial health follows on
a moment when Jacob is compelled to sign away a large chunk of his
property to Esau; in spite of this, claims the midrash, his holdings suffer
no loss. Intellectually, too, the claim is that Jacob loses none of his
learning in the course of twenty years in Laban's house. From all three
descriptions, a tension of loss and gain becomes manifest. To be whole,
apparently, means to have been in great danger and to have been saved.
Jacob's integrity has been significantly assailed on many levels, but losses
have been recouped, injuries healed, the erosion of memory successfully
fought.
Rashi continues with a parable: "like a man who says to his friend: X
emerged from between the lions' teeth and arrived home intact. So here,
'And he arrived intact. . . from Pad an Aram': from Lab an and Esau, who
both attacked him on his journey." There is an anarchic pleasure in
telling of the voracious danger and of the immaculate escape. But these
are the pleasures of myth and fairy tale; the narrative form is emphasized
in Rashi's framing device, where what sounds like a tall tale is being told.
In a more realistic context, the image of lions' teeth generates a tension in
which wholeness becomes a dynamic rather than a static idea. What is the
history of such wholeness? To mix the metaphor—how did the  
antibodies work, how were they developed, as Jacob's organism encountered
the infections of the world of Laban and Esau?
The question of "wholeness," in fact, is central and problematic in
Jacob's concept of himself and his destiny. First described as a "simple
man" (25:27), he desires—even vows his commitment to—a more  
complex process of health, in the Anglo-Saxon meaning of the word  
("wholeness"). This is a problem in equilibrium, in the managing of contrary
forms, in the husbanding of divergent energies. In Rashi's reading (32:5),
Jacob seems to pride himself on a certain impervious quality, a holding
fast to his own course, unstirred by alien winds. In other words, he seems
to see himself as successfully returned, exactly in the terms he had used
twenty years before to commit himself to a paradoxical stability in
vicissitude. This stern imperviousness is a different thing, however, from
the "wholeness" that the narrative voice, as read by Rashi, attributes to
him. Here, the midrash gives us the troubled dynamic of loss and gain,
sickness and health, oblivion and awareness.

The Quest for Wholeness
219
Lhe return to lsaac\ house: ambiguous nostalgia
As for the second "hidden" promise, implicit in Jacob's vow ("I shall
return whole to my father's bouse"), here, too, Jacob's desire, even his
commitment, to a certain act of closure is fulfilled in an unforeseen,
troubled manner. On the one hand, Jacob clearly yearns for his father's
house: he unilaterally introduces it into his reading of God's promise;
and Laban, with shrewd insight, analyzes Jacob's underlying passion
during the years of his exile: "you were longing for your father's house"
(31:30). This is a chronic nostalgia, not simply for home, but for the
home of his father. That, at least, is how Laban sees Jacob's motivation in
leaving him so stealthily.
But here, the issue of nostalgia becomes ambiguous. For the startling
truth is that Jacob never spontaneously mentions his father again, after
his vow at Beth El. On the two occasions when he speaks of return—to
Laban (30:25) and to his wives (31:13) — his desire to see his father simply
does not figure among his reasons for ending his exile. And even when he
refers to the God of his fathers, who has preserved him from Laban's
rapacity, he speaks ambiguously and enigmatically of "the God of my
father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac" (31:42). From its
position in the sentence, "my father" can be understood as referring to
Abraham, while Isaac is not even credited with a relationship to God,
other than the oblique reference to fear.4 Highly guarded in speaking of
his father, Jacob in fact returns to him only toward the end of the Parsha:
"And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre" (35:27). His return to
source is followed by a summation of Isaac's life —clearly constitutes its
consummation—and by Isaac's death. It is as though Isaac waited to die
until Jacob finally arrives back home; a sense is subtly conveyed of long
delay, of a return deferred, perhaps even avoided.
The subtext of Jacob's vow, then, presents us with a problem of
deferral, as well as a problem of wholeness. The midrash gives us a clue of
the time that elapses before Jacob actually returns home. After he has
made peace with Esau—perhaps an unavoidable preliminary to returning
home—"Jacob journeyed on to Succoth, and built a house for himself
and made stalls for his cattle" (33:17). Rashi quotes the Talmud: "He
stayed there eighteen months —a summer [Succoth, stalls], a winter [a
house], and a summer [stalls]."5 From there, he moves on to Shekhem,
where his daughter is raped and his sons massacre the townspeople. After

220
VA-YISHLAH
that, he moves on to Beth El, where he fulfills the main thrust of his
vow— to set up a stone pillar in the place of his original dream and to offer
a libation to God. There follow the deaths of Deborah and Rachel;
Reuben lies with Bilhah, in a new camping site, Migdal Ha-Eder, where
Jacob "settles"; and, finally, Jacob returns to his father.
At least eighteen months, therefore, and probably a considerably
longer period, elapses before Jacob closes the circle and returns to his
point of origin. How is one to understand this delay, this absence of Isaac
from Jacob's consciousness, from the morning after his dream until he
finally arrives home, only to bury him?
The problem of delay
The problem of delay can be approached obliquely, if we explore the
implications of the one surprising criticism leveled against Jacob in the
midrashic narratives. The Rabbis, in general, breathe no word of  
disapproval for any of Jacob's apparently more dubious acts: his acquisition of
the birthright, his "taking" of the blessing, his financial negotiations with
Laban. The harshest criticism—and the suggestion that he was terribly
punished — is leveled against Jacob's delay in fulfilling the overt thrust of
his vow at Beth El. God finally has to tell him, with some exasperation:
"Arise, go to Beth El and remain there; and build an altar there to God
who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau"
(35:1). On this, Rashi comments, condensing the Midrash Tanhuma
narrative: "Because you delayed on your journey, you were punished by
this, your daughter's fate."
The extraordinary midrashic claim is that Jacob is delinquent in
delaying his return to Beth El, where he had vowed that the stone pillar
he had erected would "become a house of God." What are tjie  
repercussions of this vow? And why is delay in fulfilling it considered so gravely as
to be punishable by the agony of his daughter?6
Even while he is still in Padan Aram, God has to remind him of his vow:
"I am the God of Beth El, where you anointed a pillar and where you
made a vow to Me. Now, arise and leave this land and return to your
native land" (31:13). Rashi reads this as implicit reproach: "'Whereyou
made a vow to Me': —and you must [lit.] pay it, since you said, 'It will
become a house of God' —that you would offer sacrifices there." This
reference to Jacob's vow does not appear in the original account in which

The Quest for Wholeness 221
God tells Jacob to return home (31:3). It is Jacob, in fact, who fills in this
detail —he must pay off what he has promised—when he explains to his
wives why he must return. The narrative thus suggests, most subtly, the
workings of Jacob's subconscious mind, the guilt that he feels at a
profound ambivalence he senses in himself.
Specifically, however, to "pay off" a vow has a precise meaning, which
Rashi here indicates. At root, a vow is a vow to sacrifice.7 When one is in
trouble, one promises to give of oneself, of one's real resources, to God, if
He will act to save one's life. The animal sacrificed, the money allocated
to the Holy Temple, is a metaphoric, even a metonymic, displacement for
the life of a person. "When you make a vow to the Lord your God, do not
put off fulfilling it, for the Lord your God will require it of you, and you
will have incurred guilt" (Deuteronomy 23:22). The statutory period of
"delay" is declared to be a cycle of three pilgrim festivals.8 Once this
period has passed, a person finds himself guilty of delay (ihur) in "paying"
his obligations of sacrifice, be they animal or money equivalents.
Even before he returns to the Holy Land, therefore, Jacob is aware of a
reluctance to "pay the sacrifice." Technically, he must transform the
place of the dream into a house of God, by sacrifice. Symbolically,
something unwhole in himself remains unresolved, according to Rashi,
until God finally and explicitly urges him to "arise, go to Beth El."
Rashi's source, in Midrash Tanhuma, is vividly evocative of the  
troubled condition of "delay":9
There are three conditions where a person's ledger is examined: if one
goes on a journey alone, if one sits in a house that is in danger of
collapse, and if one vows and does not pay [lit., make whole] one's
vow. . . . How do we know about the problem of vowing and not
paying? Because it is written, "When you make a vow to the Lord your
God, do not put off fulfilling it" [Deuteronomy 23:22]; and "It is a
snare for a man to pledge a sacred gift rashly, and to give thought to
(examine) his vows only after they have been made" [Proverbs 20:2 5]. If
one delays paying one's vow, one's ledger is examined, and the angels
assume a prosecutorial stance, and speak of his sins. . . . Come and see:
when Jacob went to Aram Naharayim, what is written? "And Jacob
made a vow. ..." He went and became wealthy, and returned and
settled down, and did not pay his vow. So God brought Esau against
him, bent on killing him, and he took all that huge gift from him—200
goats, etc.—yet Jacob did not pay attention. He brought the angel
against him; he wrestled with him but did not kill him, as it is said:

222

"Jacob was left alone. And a man wresded with him until the break of
dawn" — that was Sammael, Esau's guardian angel, who wanted to kill
him, as it is said, "He saw that he could not prevail against him." But
Jacob was crippled. And when he still did not pay attention, the trouble
with Dinah came upon him: "And Dinah went out." When he still did
not pay attention, the trouble with Rachel came upon him: "And
Rachel died and was buried." Then God said, "How long will this
righteous man take punishment and not pay attention to the sin for
which he is suffering? I must inform him now: 'Arise, go to Beth El.' —
These troubles have come upon you only because you delayed fulfilling
your vow. If you do not want any more trouble—arise and go to Beth
El, and make an altar there, in the very place where you vowed to Me.
In time of distress, you made a vow, and in time of ease, you let it slip
from your mind?!"
When Jacob made his vow, he prayed to be preserved from the three
cardinal sins: idolatry, immorality, and bloodshed. Because he delayed
fulfilling his vow, he became guilty of all three: idolatry— " 'Rid  
yourselves of the alien gods in your midst'" (35:2); immorality—the story
of Dinah; and bloodshed — "They [Simeon and Levi] killed every male
[in the city of Shekhem]" (34:25). This teaches you that delaying the
fulfillment of a vow is a graver offense than all three cardinal sins!
"It is better not to vow at all than to vow and not fulfill" (Ecclesiastes
5:4). R. Meir said: It is better than both alternatives [vowing and not
fulfilling one's vow, or even vowing and fulfilling one's vow] not to vow
at all. A person should simply bring his lamb to the Temple Courtyard
and slaughter it. R. Yehuda said: It is better than both alternatives
[vowing and not fulfilling one's vow, or not vowing at all] to vow and
fulfill one's vow, as it is said, "Make vows and pay them to the Lord your
God" (Psalms 76:12). One then receives reward, both for the vow and
for the fulfillment.
The main statement of the midrash is, of course, that the making of a
vow creates a sacred, dangerous reality. To delay fulfilling a vow is not so
much a moral issue as it is a question of disturbing an essential balance.
Like going on a journey, unaccompanied, or sitting in a house that is
about to collapse, the unfulfilled vow suggests a state of disequilibrium:
the whole structure may collapse around one's ears, the forces of chaos
are free to attack, one has exposed oneself to the baneful stare of the
accusing angels.
While solitary journeys and dilapidated houses are obviously  
dangerous, however, the peculiar peril of the unfulfilled vow needs some

111
clarification. It is as though one has enjoyed a special kind of oral
pleasure, as in the quotation from Proverbs: one has eaten of the sacred,
of the animals set aside for ritual purposes. To vow is to break a rational
limitation, a clear boundary between hand and mouth, as another mid-
rash puts it: "Let your hand [the fulfillment of your vow] be close to your
mouth. The Sages said: Let your hand be in front of your mouth—that is,
hold the object to be vowed, ready in your hand, before uttering vows."10 If
the mouth is not underwritten, as it were, by the hand, if words  
correspond to nothing, then one finds that one has created a reality-that-is-
not-reality.
Language has the power to create such marginal — sacred and  
dangerous—realities. In making a vow, one constructs an image of an  
intended future, and thereby opens a Pandora's box of conflicts and  
resistances, of hitherto hidden fears and fantasies: the ledger of one's inner
being, in the imagery of the midrash, is exposed to searching angelic
gaze. The unbalanced books are audited, and one may find, even if only in
subconscious form, the three cardinal sins traced within. The gap  
between hand and mouth is a perilous space; by bringing trouble after
trouble upon him, God tries to make Jacob aware of the need to close the
gap. But Jacob does not pay attention: he is insensitive to the implications
of catastrophe, to the single message encoded in the many blows that rain
down on him.
The midrash insists that the root of all Jacob's vicissitudes on his
return to the Holy Land is the problem of delay, that dangerous space of
unawareness that separates the vow from its fulfillment. In the end, God
gives up on symbolic codes of reminder and—baldly, literally—tells
Jacob to close the gap between symbolic language and realization: "Arise,
go to Beth El." For the vow claims to transcend, to transgress the limits of
space and time. It pretends to a stake now in a portion of reality that is not,
empirically, ncrw. This is the great joy of utterance before the fact: it puts
into words what must be deferred, and translates the exigencies of action
into the freedom of symbolic language.
At times. ... I would let myself daydream; I would discover, in a state
of anguish, ghastly possibilities, a monstrous universe that was only the
underside of my omnipotence; I would say to myself: anything can
happen! and that meant: I can imagine anything. Tremulously, always
on the point of tearing up the page, I would relate supernatural

VA-YISHLAH
atrocities. If my mother happened to read over my shoulder, she would
utter a cry of glory and alarm: "What an imagination!"11
and alarm
Glory and alarm: the power of imagination and of language arouses
ambivalent responses. In the midrashic argument, the alarmed response
is that of R. Meir, who declares: better not to vow at all. For there is always
risk in utterance, in the work of the mouth. Better simply to act: language
is unnecessary and potentially dangerous. Its danger is formulated in the
reproach God directs at Jacob: "When you were in distress, you made a
vow—now you are at ease, you let it slip from your mind." What could
make one utter what is not there, if one were not in such distress as impels
one to a vow, rather than die? One offers one's real substance in words,
substituting for the life that is under duress. But this offer of words is
intrinsically an irresponsible, perilous substitute. It is a gesture of  
sacrifice without the blood, without the real cost. In the best of cases, even
where the gap is eventually closed, one should not do it, says R. Meir: the
alarming power of words is too great.
R. Yehuda, on the other hand, insists on the glory of avowals. The
highest possibility is that of vowing and fulfilling one's vow, achieving a
kind of equilibrium that will contain the originating anguish that led to
words in the first place. Such words are informed by the pressure of
reality. Just to take the animal and slaughter it is a brief, inglorious act: to
vow the sacrifice, to lay claim to a territory in time not yet one's own, is to
be most fully human.
In the vow, imagination and will press for words to embody a radical
sense of power. "Every intention is an attention, and attention is I-can,"
writes Merleau-Ponty.12 In making a vow ("Man is the only creature who
can make promises" [Nietzsche]),13 one experiences one's identity, one's
ability to see and construct a future. But consciously to intend an act— an
act of closure, in particular—and then to feel oneself incapable of making
good on that intention, is to be plunged into a radical despair, in which all
the books are opened to the accusing stare of the vengeful angels.
This, I suggest, is the implication of the midrash about Jacob's  
condition at the time of his return to the Holy Land. Returning is a harrowing
experience: vows have to be made good, what was begun in words has to
be completed, made whole (shalem — to pay, fulfill, make whole). If Jacob
Kjlory

The Quest for Wholeness
225
had fulfilled his vow, according to R. Yehuda, he would have received
reward both for the vow and for the fulfillment. He would have been the
first human being14 to engage in this most alarming, glorious act of
interfusing words and acts, so that each informs the other. Jacob,  
however, does not make good on his vow; mysteriously, in a way that is never
made explicit in the text, he avoids such a closing of the circle.
The notion of delay in fulfilling a vow is profoundly equivocal. Jacob
does not, after all, refuse to fulfill his vow: he simply delays, hangs back
(aher, the word for "delay," is rooted in the idea of "behind, at the back").
This is a passive, not active, denial. But, effectively, repression is the
gravest form of refusal (graver than the three cardinal sins), since it will
not engage with—avow or disavow—the vow. Through all the symbolic
bombardments of fate, he remains unaware, not reading the signs of his
condition. In the imagery of the midrash, the books are open and fatally
unbalanced: he alone fails to decipher the traces of his own debt.
The problem that is called "delay" is most clearly inscribed in the
issue of the vow: God finally sets aside the challenges and risks of
symbolic disclosure and tells Jacob to return to Beth El and bring his
sacrifices. This issue is then apparently resolved, immediately preceding
the death of Deborah and Jacob's renaming (35:7). The main thrust of
the vow is fulfilled, language is made whole in action, as Jacob builds an
altar and offers sacrifices in the very place of his vow.
This, however, is only the visible tip of the iceberg. The fulfillment of
the vow with animal sacrifices can be seen as the "objective correlative"
(T. S. Eliot's term) for a much larger and more pervasive problem. Rashi
hints at a more diffuse issue of delay: " 'While Jacob stayed in that land'
(35:22): during the period before he came to Hebron, to Isaac, all these
things happened to him."
VJinah's tragedy: Jacob's responsibility
The issue is not simply one of delay in the technical fulfillment of a vow
(as in the Tanhuma passage), but of what Rashi himself, in a subtle
recasting of the words, calls a "delay 0« tbejoumey" (35:1).15 The  
implication, spelled out inMizrahi's supercommentary on Rashi (35:22), is that
Jacob's delay is in returning to his father. It was because of this delay that
"all these things happened to him." There is an intuition here of reluc-

226
VA-YISHLAH
tance, of hanging back. And it is this reservation, this arriere-pensee, that
will claim much of our attention from this point.
For what, indeed, holds Jacob back? Among the criticisms that the
Sages level at Jacob, perhaps the most unexpected is his responsibility for
the rape of Dinah. This, specifically, according to Rashi (35:1), happened
because of "delay on the journey." But Rashi himself quotes midrashic
sources to suggest an apparently different etiology for that disaster:" 'His
eleven children' (32:22): And where was Dinah? He placed her in a box and
locked it, so that Esau should not lay eyes on her. For this, Jacob was
punished, for withholding her from his brother—perhaps she would have
redeemed him? —and she fell into the hands of Shekhem."
Mizrahi strikingly diagnoses Jacob's refusal to let Esau see and marry
Dinah as the root of the tragedy that leads to Dinah's rape. There is
something in Jacob that expresses itself in putting Dinah in a box.
Because of this —presumably because he is afraid to confront Esau with
Dinah visible —Jacob has to delay in Succoth for eighteen months and
incurs the terrible punishment of the Shekhem catastrophe. On such a
reading, there is a radical connection between Jacob's refusal to let Esau
see Dinah and his "delay on the journey": Dinah's tragedy is a  
consequence of both, the final point in a narrative chain that goes back to
Jacob's failure in love for his brother, Esau:16 "He said: This wicked man
has presumptuous eyes —let him not look at her and take her from
me. . . . God said to him: 'A friend owes loyalty to one who fails'
(Job 6:14) —You have withheld love from your brother."17
Beneath a plausible surface—Jacob protects his only daughter from
Esau's lust—the midrash detects a kind of avarice: "he will take her from
me." Augustine's insight about incest comes to mind: it is forbidden
because it represents the sin of avarice18 —love is being hoarded, kept
"locked up," in the family. Precisely here, within Jacob's apparently
reasonable fear for his daughter, the Sages decipher a failure in hesed, in
that imaginative risk-taking that leads one to vow and to make good
on vows.
The connection between Dinah's fate and Jacob's attitude to the
future is again imaginatively sketched in the following midrash:
R. Yehuda bar Simon said: "Do not boast of tomorrow" [Proverbs
27:1]— yet you said, "Tomorrow, let my honesty testify for me"  
[Genesis 30:33]. Tomorrow, your daughter will go out and be tormented by

The Quest for Wholeness
111
Shekhem. R. Hanina said: "A friend owes loyalty to one who fails" [Job
6:14] —you have withheld love from your brother.19
Two views of the root cause of Dinah's tragedy are juxtaposed here:
R. Hanina speaks of the failure in love, which we touched on in the
previous midrash, while R. Yehuda points to a speech of Jacob's in quite a
different context. Guaranteeing his own future probity in fulfilling the
terms of their salary agreement, Jacob speaks of the morrow with great
confidence. R. Yehuda finds this confidence about the future  
objectionable. He mobilizes the verse from Proverbs: "Do not boast of tomorrow,"
to suggest that Jacob is guilty of a kind of hubris about his righteousness
"tomorrow." The verse continues, "for you do not know what the day
will bring" (lit., what the day will give birth to). In this reading, Jacob is
found radically responsible for Dinah's fate: he speaks of the future with
an arrogance that is inappropriate to the real mystery, the discontinuity
of history, as seen by one fully participating in its contingencies. The
birth image conveys this sense of the unknowable: Jacob charges at the
future with a bravado not of confidence, but of fear. What happens to
Dinah is a terrible reminder of the hollowness of such bravado.
This criticism of Jacob may seem excessively rigorous. But taken in
conjunction with R. Hanina's view— about a failure in besed, in  
imaginative love —and with a third, enigmatic criticism, a profile begins to
emerge, a subtle tracing of what the Sages see as Jacob's main problem —
the problem we have indicated as deferral, delay, hanging back.
The third criticism occurs strangely after Jacob is reconciled with
Esau and after his stay in Succoth. He arrives at Shekhem, buys a plot of
land, and constructs an altar: "And he called Him, El, God of Israel"
(33:20). The rape of Dinah follows immediately. The Hebrew text is
highly ambiguous: it is not clear who called whom (or what). Rashi, for
instance, offers two explanations: Jacob commemorates his new  
relationship to God in that place by the name he gives the altar; and God names
Jacob, El, indicating strength.20 Most extraordinary, however, is the
reading in Bereshit Rabbab:
"And he called him, God": Jacob said, "You are the God of the upper
worlds, and I am god of the lower worlds." Even the cantor in the
synagogue does not arrogate authority to himself [cannot assume the
privilege of reading the Torah unless he has first been summoned] —
and you would arrogate authority [serara] to yourself! Tomorrow, your

228
VA-YISHLAH
daughter will go out and be tormented— as it is written, "Now Dinah
went out."21
In a provocative, deliberate misreading of the text, the midrash has
Jacob call himself, "El, God of Israel," arrogating to himself divine
powers "in the lower worlds." Again, some form of hubris seems to be
involved, a tragic miscalculation of the range of his own control over the
lower worlds. Jacob has a certain consciousness of his ability to create
worlds, to impose order and meaning on his experience. But this self-
consciousness is faulted by the Sages: there are limits to control.
Indeed, the problem of authority [serara] is raised implicitly in the very
name that the angel has given to Jacob: "Your name shall no longer be
Jacob but Israel" (32:29). Rashi explains the name change:
"No longer shall it be said that the blessings came to you through
insinuation and trickery, but by authority [serara-yisra-el] and openly
[lit., with a revealed face]. God will reveal Himself to you at Beth El,
and He will change your name, and there He will bless you. And I will
be there and confirm them for you." Hence, it is written: "And he
[Jacob] strove [sara] with an angel and prevailed—the other had to
weep and implore him" [Hosea 12:5]. What did the angel implore
him? "At Beth El, God will meet us and there He will speak with us.
Wait for me [let me go], until He speaks with us there." But Jacob did
not agree and, against his will, the angel confirmed the blessings to
him-"And he blessed him there" [32:30].
Jacob insists on assuming his changed name immediately. The angel
acknowledges that "you have striven [sarita— exerted power, authority]
with God and with men," but begs that Jacob's new modality of control
be properly defined by God at Beth El. Jacob will not wait. One modern
reading22 has, in fact, seen in this premature assumption of the name,
Israel, the fault that the midrash decries: "Jacob called himself Israel"
before he had any authority to do so (35:10).
What Jacob reveals in this enigmatic episode is a profound fascination
with the idea of authority. Subtly, the midrash suggests that such a power
to structure his reality is both genuinely his, proven by the encounter
with the angel, and yet somehow beyond him, desired by him with too
much passion. The question of timing is central: Jacob will not let the
angel go and wait for God's confirmation of his new sense of power. It is as
though an old skin is being sloughed off, a sense of uncongenial identity is

The Quest for Wholeness
229
rejected, with an impatience that provokes criticism: "you arrogate  
authority to yourself."
Jacob on power: fascination and fear
Jacob's concern for serara, for control over his experience, invites further
exploration. When he first sends messengers to placate Esau, he uses the
expression, "I have sojourned [garti] with Laban" (32:5). Rashi offers
two readings. In one, as we have seen, Jacob proclaims his spiritual
integrity—untouched by Laban's culture, he has kept all 613  
commandments. In the other, however, he assumes a low profile, presumably in
order to pacify Esau: "I have not become powerful [sar—z prince] or
important, but have simply been a stranger \ger]. It is not worth your
while to hate me for father's blessings, since he blessed me, 'Be master
[g'vir] over your brothers' [27:29], and you see that has not been fulfilled
in me."
Jacob placates Esau by insisting that one of the main issues of Isaac's
blessing has not, in fact, been realized in him: he has no power, he is
marginal to all societies. In Rashi's reading, his intention seems clearly
tactical — to defuse Esau's hatred. But perhaps there is another dimension
to his disclaimer. Perhaps Jacob protests too much, with the excessive
humility of one fascinated by the concept of authority. Fascinated and
afraid — for to be weak means to be killed, while to be strong means to kill.
In such simple terms, the midrash focuses the dilemma of power, as it
analyzes the description of Jacob's feelings before meeting Esau:" lHe was
greatly frightened and anxious' (32:8): He was afraid of being killed. And he
was anxious at the idea of killing. 'If he prevails \yitgaber] over me, he will
kill me, while if I prevail over him, I will kill him.' "23
Beyond deflecting Esau's jealousy, Jacob's disclaimer is a meditation
on powers not yet realized. The full blessing of serara and gevura is not yet
his. The question of his own survival seems poised against Esau's survival:
will the struggle for power take the form—the primal, essential form—of
fratricide?
Sharpened by the issue of survival, then, Jacob's concern about control
dominates this period of his life. Prematurely calling himself Israel, even
naming himself "god of the lower worlds," assuming mastery of the
future, keeping Dinah in a box so that Esau does not set eyes on her and
force a change in Jacob's structuring of his integrity—all these are facets

230
VA-YISHLAH
of a single will: to master, comprehend, and control his experience. This
is a concern for form, for the coherence of the parts and the integrity of
the whole. If Jacob is to achieve such authority over his life, his camp, his
future, he must box up Dinah, he must "withhold love" from Esau. For
"love spoils the straight line";24 it breaks through pre-imposed patterns,
it opens gaps in secure defenses. Jacob must be able to guarantee his
future righteousness, and he must call himself, unequivocally, Israel.
Jacob's wisdom: fastness and lateness
The central image that expresses Jacob's dilemma at this period of his
life—the dilemma of mastery—is of Jacob behind. He sends ahead herds
of livestock, as propitiatory gifts, and instructs his servants: "And you
shall say, 'He himself is behind us. . . . Your servant Jacob is behind us.'"
(32:19, 21). Arranging his encounter with Esau, he structures his camp
with great deliberation: the secondary wives with their children in front,
"Leah and her children behind [aharonim] and Rachel and Joseph last
[aharonim]" (33:2). The emphasis on "lastness" leads Rashi to quote the
well-known aphorism: aharon aharon baviv—"the further back [the later],
the more loved."
Spatially, there is a principle of lastness, corresponding to the  
temporal principle of lateness, of delay, that the midrash defined as the key to
Jacob's history at this time of return. The same Hebrew root, aber> covers
both spatial and temporal "deferment." Jacob has, in fact, choreographed
both his personal camp of wives and children and his propitiatory gifts
("He told his servants, 'keep a distance between droves' "[32:17]). He has
organized the gifts for effect, instructing each of his servants, walking
behind each of the flocks (32:20), exactly what to say to Esau. From his
position at the rear, he has planned ahead of time what Esau will ask, and
what the servants will reply: "Why did he not send Esau all the flocks
mixed together? In order to astonish him at the immensity and range of
the gift. And why did he not send them all at once [the flocks immediately
following one another]? In order to satisfy the eye of that wicked man."25
Subtly, Jacob plans the presumed effect of his gift. For maximum
impact, he allows the suspense of a space between flocks, playing with
Esau's constant surprise, as he assumes that the procession of animals has
ended—only to find it begin again.

The Quest for Wholeness
231
Characteristically, then, Jacob leads from behind-, he is the thinker, the
one who projects in images and words, the director behind the scenes.
This is, properly speaking, the position of the hunter, tracking his prey
from the rear. Jacob comes into the world behind: "After that {aharei
kheri), his brother emerged, holding on to the heel of Esau; so they named
him Jacob" (25:26). Esau cries out, deprived of his blessing, "He has
outwitted [va-ya 'akveni] me twice" (27:36) —playing on Jacob's behind-
the-scenes name. (Akev is the heel, the back of the foot.) Esau sees him as
the snake, who comes up from behind and attacks the heel.26
But the ambiguous quality of such lateness is marked by Rashi and the
Targum, in their translations of Esau's cry: "He has been too clever
[ve-bakmani\ for me." It is the essential meaning of hokhma, wisdom—not
to rush in where angels fear to tread, but to imagine and manipulate
realities from the sidelines. The sophistication of one who lies in wait,
who bides his time, who plans his strategies from the rear, is Jacob's
character and destiny. He is the ultimate man—born second, his destiny
deferred. This is the classic midrashic reading of his position at birth, a
historical vision of the eventual triumph of Jerusalem over Rome.27
Such a celebration of lateness in history has its roots in the promise to
Abraham, in the Covenant of the Pieces. It will be after all the suffering
and slavery in Egypt, God tells Abraham, that "in the end [aharei khen],
they shall go free with great wealth" (15:14). He who laughs last laughs
best. It is Jacob who will see the end of the story, the whole meaning of
history.
There is, however, a darker aspect to lateness. Jacob —about to  
become Israel — lives the full ambiguity of being behind. In the midrash, his
tragic flaw was defined as being related to lateness: "You delayed on the
journey." There is a tendency in Jacob that can be called sophistication,
subtlety, imagination, but that exposes him to less flattering epithets:
Rabbi and R. Yossi ben R. Yehuda were walking along, when they saw a
Roman police officer coming toward them. Rabbi said: He will ask you
three questions — "Who are you? What is your profession? And where
are you going?" "Who are you?" —"Jews." "What is your  
profession?" — "Businessmen." "And where are you going?" —"To allocate
wheat for the granaries at Dibnia." Rabbi presented himself to the
police officer to see what he would ask him, while R. Yossi waited
beside him to catch any further questions—so that there should be
no discrepancy in their answers. R. Yossi then asked Rabbi: Where

232
VA-YISHLAH
did you learn to prepare the answer before the question? And Rabbi
replied: From Jacob our father—"So you shall say . . . behold, he is
behind us."28
The Roman militia are experienced as embodying all the sinister
aspects of Esau, with "game in his mouth" (25:28) —which, as reported
by Rashi, is midrashically understood as "trying to trap the unwary with
sophistical questions." The situation of the two sages, menaced by hostile
authority, generates a prototypical response: Rabbi rehearses the answer
before the question. Compelled by experience of the hunter, the prey
develops its own evasion strategies: the prey, in fact, becomes hunter,
subtly tracking the enemy, "knowing from behind." Their paradigm is
Jacob, characteristically "behind," late, wary, conscious of all  
possibilities. The sages and their paradigm assume a purely reactionary role:
they will not take the initiative, they merely prepare their responses to the
initiatives of others.
This, of course, is an eminently reasonable stance in a situation where
all the power is with the enemy. But it is not so much the political as the
psychological aspect of the midrash that commands our attention. The
sages, faced with brute power, firmly ground that power in the arena of
language. Who wins in that arena wins the game. The obliquities of
language, the rhetorical power attributed by the sages to Esau, are met by
a truthful, but thoroughly rehearsed use of language on the part of Jacob.
Always cautious, alive to the possible implications of a narrative, to the
fatal consequences of discrepancies between texts, the sages hone and
harmonize their story— as Jacob writes the script for the dialogues of his
servants and Esau, choreographs the eloquent movements of the herds of
livestock.
What is at issue is indicated in the expletive effect of Jacob's name, as
Esau so derisively and bitterly utters it: "Was he then named Jacob that
he might outwit me these two times?" (27:36). It is not a question of
deception, of lying to his brother: the sages tell the truth under  
interrogation. What maddens Esau is Jacob's reluctance to confront, his
distrust of the face of the other. He will wait offstage, preparing his lines
until they are word-perfect. He will parley for peace, but he will not trust
the immediacy of a relationship with his brother, however sincere his
kisses may seem to be.29
Spontaneity, therefore, is not Jacob's strong suit. Time must elapse,
meanings must be allowed to emerge, before one hazards a reaction.

The Quest for Wholeness
233
What is to be must be as fully preconceived in the mind as possible.30
This is, of course, a kind of control, a way of mastering a perilous reality.
Oblique, subtle, Jacob plans ahead, previsioning Esau's responses,  
choreographing sheep and goats, so that they send messages of endless
stimulation, induce in his brother spasms of an almost erotic excitement.
His own camp he structures with an equal deliberation: what is most
loved is behind, what is behind is most beloved. Love flourishes where the
deferred, the symbolic meanings are most in play, in the spaces, the
fissures, where imagination traces out infinite possibilities.31
becoming Israel: confrontation and mastery
The ultimate —and absurd —recourse of such a dynamic of reservation
and deferral is the image of Dinah in a box. Jacob has "withheld love"
from his brother; he has lost hope and trust in a reality of confrontation
and change. The paradoxical hazard of too sophisticated, too "delaying"
a consciousness is a kind of impotence. To be obsessed with controlling
the issues in a complex world is to risk losing all dynamic contact with that
world.
But the Jacob of our Parsha is Jacob-about-to-become-Israel. From
his first message to Esau, he is concerned with the fact that he has not yet
consummated his father's blessing: "Be master over your brothers"
(27:29): "I have not become powerful or important" (Rashi, 32:5). On a
conscious level, Jacob is deflecting his brother's jealousy and hatred, but,
unconsciously, he is exercised by the problem of serara, of mastery. What
is the meaning of authority, how does one control the contingencies, the
absurdities of experience, how does one, in effect, author one's own life?
Up to now, Jacob acknowledges, "I have been on the margins of Laban's
world, a sojourner, a stranger; I have been in the abor, in the rear, the late
position." Anticipating events—the story of the striped and speckled
sheep is a paradigm here — orchestrating responses of animals and  
people—Jacob has capitalized on his intelligence and foresight. In his  
dialogues with Laban and with his wives, he has deployed all his verbal
resources to outwit his enemies. But now, the modality of "behindness"
begins to irk him, for it has not led to the fulfillment of his father's
blessing. In order to be a sar, a person of power and authority, something
else is needed — a capacity to confront, a passionate will that exposes one
to loss and injury.

234
VA-YISHLAH
In a magnificendy ironic moment, the narrative sets Jacob's "behind-
ness" in perspective, by comparing it with—of all things—Shekhem's
passion for Dinah. Dinah's brothers demand that Shekhem and all the
males in his town circumcise themselves, as part of the marriage  
agreement. "And the youth lost no time [lo iher] in doing the thing, for he
wanted Jacob's daughter" (34:19). Shekhem, the villain-rapist, is  
presented in an unexpectedly sympathetic light: he wants, he desires, he
loves.32 Exposing himself to circumcision, he risks his manhood; he does
not "hang back," "lose time," delay. On this axis, Jacob and Shekhem
emerge as polar opposites: subde, aware of suspended meanings, Jacob
lacks something in passion.
It is in this context that his confrontation with the man-angel becomes
most significant. The mysterious "man" seems to come upon him  
unawares. Before he knows, before he can put himself on guard, he is
embraced and held in the loving-hostile grip of the wresder. Rashi's
reading of the word, va-ye'avek ["wresded"] is illuminating: he  
emphasizes nuances of twining, knotting round one another, being tied  
together— "for this is the way of two people who strain to push each other
down to the ground—they embrace and struggle [bovko ve-ovko] with each
other" (32:24). This is clearly a passionate experience, involving the
closest confrontation (literally face-to-face)33 of the whole body.
We described Jacob as taken unawares by the strange "man." But
perhaps, in some enigmatic sense, Jacob is the aggressor, who has waited,
"alone," for the man, whose struggle is expressed in the passive form— as
though it is Jacob who engages with him, or who has conjured the man's
spirit out of the lonely air. Who is this man? The classic midrashic answer
is that he is Esau's guardian angel, literally his sar— his authority, the
principle of his authenticity. (The Greek ancestry of the word resonates
with violence. Authenteo: to have full power over; also, to commit a
murder. Authentes: a master, a doer; also, a perpetrator, a murderer, even a
self-murderer, a suicide.)34
Another midrashic tradition, however, suggests a more ambiguous
identification: " 'I shall not let you go till you tell me your name.' And he
called his name Israel —like his own (the angel's) name, for his name was
Israel."35
In this reading, the angel has come for no hostile purpose but "to save
and rescue him." This angel is called Israel, perhaps because that is the
purpose of his mission, to show Jacob, in a therapeutic encounter, how to

The Quest for Wholeness
235
become Israel. Since angels are named for their mission, this may be the
reason for the angel's response to Jacob's question ("What is your
name?") —"Why do you ask my name?" Jacob already knows in himself
the purpose of the angel's coming, for, essentially, he is facing himself,
the desired-feared necessity of a new name. He has summoned the angel
to save him from the condition of being Jacob.
The struggle between Jacob and the Israel principle has no  
unequivocal outcome. Two approaches to power, to authority, even to authenticity,
are mobilized here. There is a dialectical confrontation, in which, as the
Netziv puts it, "both of them prevailed."36 Jacob emerges with a thigh
injury. Even if we take into account the midrashic reading that the rising
"sun brought him healing" (Rashi, 32:31), the Netziv suggests that this
healing cured only the immediate pain and made it all the clearer to Jacob
that he would, in fact, limp all his life: "he realized that the angel, too, had
prevailed over him to some extent."
Evenly matched, Jacob wants to prevail, to absorb into himself the
power of his partner. He wants to become Israel, by mastering the angel.
The wrestling match is an occasion for clarification, for discovery of the
parameters of personal power.37 At a certain point in the match, the angel
sees that he cannot prevail over Jacob and injures his thigh. He then begs
for release: " 'Let me go, for dawn is breaking.' But he answered, 'I will
not let you go, unless you bless me'" (32:26).
Another midrash deciphers a connection between the injury and
Jacob's refusal to release the angel: "He said, 'You have injured me and
hurt me —I shall not let you go.'"38 Jacob is given a certain moral
advantage by his injury. Against all the arguments of the angel ("It is time
for me to sing God's praises —if I miss today, I will never be allowed to
sing again—I was not sent to bless you —if I obey you, I will be expelled
from my place in Heaven"), against all rational and mystical objections,
Jacob insists on holding the angel, and gaining the blessing— because he
has been injured. His Jacob-identity suffers a pang of inner knowledge.
This identity is not sufficient: the angel who has the face of Israel must
yield up his secret of "more life."39 The pain Jacob suffers empowers him
to defy convention and claim a larger range of authenticity.
Ultimately, of course, Jacob and Israel both remain his names. The
dialectical confrontation between his two personae is never entirely
resolved. This is true throughout the biblical and prophetic writings,
where the passionate power of confrontation and the sophisticated

236
VA-YISHLAH
"knowing from behind" both remain essential aspects of the man and the
nation, undergoing mutations and reworkings throughout history.40  
Certainly, before God confirms the angePs blessing, Jacob's unequivocal
assumption of the name Israel is unjustified. It betrays Jacob's ongoing
conflict, the dilemma of double identity, and his desire for unambiguous
resolutions.
Jacob-Israel: a "crippling sense of belatedness"
Jacob-Israel is indeed an uneasy combination. Jacob desires both  
knowledge and power, both subtlety and potency. If the sages criticize him for
failing in love for Esau, for a premature arrogation of authority, or for an
overconfidence about what the morrow will yield, essentially their  
criticisms can all be focused on the basic issue of ibur: "You have delayed on
the journey." To be behind or in front, to be late or early, deferring or
confronting: it is along this axis of possibilities that Jacob must plot his
course.
When he meets Esau, after his night encounter with his Israel-self,
"he himself went on ahead" (33:3). He is held in close embrace by his
brother: Va-y'habkehu clearly evokes the love-hate ambiguities of the
wrestler's grip — va-yeyavek. There is a tension that is both erotic and
agonistic, since each brother wants of the other what he lacks, and each
fears to lose his place on the earth. As Jacob's family move forward to
meet Esau, it retains its highly formalized structure, the dearest last. But
Jacob himself embraces and is embraced. He offers Esau his "blessing"
(33:11), by which he means, according to Rashi, his gift, his salute to
Esau, in the moment of true encounter: he greets the godliness in Esau's
face (33:10) and, implicitly, he wishes him, too, more life. This is a
moment of equilibrium, in which Esau is genuinely moved by Jacob's
courage and generosity.
Such a courage is composed of multiple levels of readiness, say the
sages — readiness for war, for peace, for prayer. His enlarged sense of his
own power leads Jacob, paradoxically, to an equivalent awareness of his
brother's power; underlying both is the equalizing knowledge of man's
condition in the presence of God. Emerson's definition of courage seems
relevant here: "Courage consists in the conviction that they with whom
you contend are no more than you. If we believed in the existence of strict
individuals, natures, that is, not radically identical but unknown, immea-

The Quest for Wholeness
237
surable, we should never dare to fight."41 A certain mystique of the
individual, "unknown, immeasurable," has to be shed if Jacob is to
confront Esau as "no more" than himself, as "radically identical" with
himself.
Harold Bloom deploys this passage from Emerson, as part of his
argument about the problem of power in the growth of poetic genius.
Emerson manifests "acute apprehension of the sorrows of poetic  
influence. ... If the new poet succumbs to a vision of the precursor as the
Sublime, 'unknown, immeasurable,1 then the great contention with the
dead father will be lost. . . . Emerson, shrewdest of all visionaries, early
perceived the accurate enemy in the path of aspiring youth: 'Genius is
always sufficiently the enemy of genius by overinfluence.'"
At root, the question of "overinfluence," the Oedipal problem in the
area of psychological and spiritual development, lies at the base of all
Jacob's "delays." Jacob suffers, literally and figuratively, from a  
"crippling sense of belatedness," in Bloom's rhetoric. In the simplest sense, he
is the last of the patriarchs; the essential, dramatic directions have been
plotted by his father and grandfather. If we adopt the kabbalistic formula
of hesed(\ove) andgevura (strength), Abraham has traced out the course of
love, daring, expansiveness, and imagination, while Isaac has lived the
inward life, shadowed by fear, by constriction, by a knowledge of what it is
to be bound on an altar. This, too, yields its wisdom, generates a subtlety,
a fine-tuned awareness of structures and differences. What is left for
Jacob to do?
The answer offered in classic midrashic sources is that, in some sense,
Jacob is to be the ideal "true" synthesis of the polar characteristics of
Abraham and Isaac. But, in real terms, the problem of a Jacob is not
capable of simple solutions. R. Hutner offers a colloquial Yiddish  
epigram: Abraham was the gewvrrener— the one who became; Isaac was the
geborrener— the one who was born into it; while Jacob was the far-
fallener—xhe one who no longer had any choice. Thesis, antithesis, and
synthesis: the role of the third generation is clearly the most complex,
precisely because in an obvious sense everything has already been done.
Bloom's argument, worked out in The Anxiety of Influence, A Map of
Misreading, and The Breaking of the Vessels, is that to be born later is, for
the poet, for the creative person, a "crippling" experience. One cannot
avoid saying what has already been said: one suffers from the Oedipal
dilemma of having been preceded: "A poet... is not so much a man

238
VA-YISHLAH
speaking to men as a man rebelling against being spoken to by a dead man
(the precursor) outrageously more alive than himself. A poet dare not
regard himself as being late, yet cannot accept a substitute for the first
vision he reflectively judges to have been his precursor's also."42
This is Jacob's dilemma. At the core, what "cripples" him is his sense
of his father's crippling. Isaac, in the branding moment of his life, was
bound hand and foot; and Jacob, in spite of all his movements of hand and
feet, in spite of the freedom and energy he expresses in love and work
during the years away from his father's house, remains profoundly  
absorbed by his father's trauma.
This, I suggest, is the conflict indicated by his translation of God's
promise in the dream at Beth El: where God had said, "I shall bring you
back to this land," Jacob declares, "if I come back in wholeness to my
fathers house." Thereafter, as we have noticed, Jacob avoids any mention
of his father, apart from one enigmatic reference to "the God of my
father, the God of Abraham," and to "the Fear of Isaac" (31:42). It seems
as though, in order to hew out a possible identity for himself, he flinches
from confronting the image of his father, the fear that is his father's
genius: "Genius is always sufficiently the enemy of genius by over-
influence." And he most poignantly expresses this "overinfluence" by
delaying his return home, to his "father's house."
The necessary synthesis
It is this delay, with its refusal to confront, to take account of the past, by
acknowledgment or by repudiation, that is diagnosed as the tragic flaw of
this period of his life. Hanging back, reserving his options, reluctant to
return, Jacob refuses to negotiate the necessary synthesis between his
father and his grandfather, between subtlety and passion. He is radically
afraid to speak of his father's God as anything other than fear,43 afraid to
engage with that fear and move toward love.
Harold Bloom articulates the general human dilemma:
If we are human, then we depend upon a Scene of Instruction, which is
necessarily also a scene of authority and of priority. If you will not have
one instructor or another, then precisely by rejecting all instructors,
you will condemn yourself to the earliest Scene of Instruction that
imposed itself upon you. The clearest analogue is necessarily Oedipal;
reject your parents vehemently enough, and you will become a belated

The Quest for Wholeness
239
version of them, but compound with their reality, and you may partly
free yourself.44
Jacob, afraid of fear, is fixed in fear ("Jacob was greatly frightened and
anxious" [32:8]); he is a "belated version" of Isaac, just because he rejects,
he defers the encounter with what Isaac represents. To compound with
his father's reality would be to achieve his own freedom —what Ramban
calls his own helek, his unique synthesis of the worlds of his precursors.45
For Bloom, this involves first a willingness to be instructed by the
experience of one's father, and, ultimately—as in the case of the "strong
poet" — a capacity to "misread," to engage in vital, original reinterpreta-
tions, which necessarily involve falsifications, of the work of one's  
precursors. The "willful re-interpretation of all reality" (de Man) must involve
such "misreading," because "every strong reading insists that the  
meaning it finds is exclusive and accurate."46
Jacob's career, according to Ramban, who draws on kabbalistic sources, is
a quest for equilibrium, for emet, truth on the psychological as well as the
cognitive plane. Jacob seeks his true self, in R. D. Laing's use of the term.
He wants to "read strongly" the texts his precursors have bequeathed to
him; paradoxically, though, such a reading must be both faithful and
"false," he must both submit to instruction and rebel against his late
condition, if he is to avoid being a mere replica, helplessly branded, of his
precursor.
This he achieves, Ramban claims, at the end of his life, when he goes
down to Egypt to rejoin his lost son, Joseph: "So Jacob set out with all
that was his, and he came to Beer Sheva, where he offered sacrifices to the
God of his father Isaac. God called to him in a vision by night" (46:1-2).
Why, asks Ramban, is his father Isaac so clearly specified as the paradigm
of relationship with God, at this time of his life? Rashi had quoted the
general principle that "one owes respect to one's father more than to
one's grandfather." Ramban comments that it might have been more
courteous simply to write of "the God of his fathers," without giving
preference to one or the other, as Jacob in fact does later, for the first time
(48:15),47 or else to avoid any mention of his family. The point is,
however, that Jacob, as he reaches a maturity of his own "strong" identity,
relates fully to both his precursors, and especially to his father Isaac. For it
is the Fear of Isaac (31:42, 53), Isaac's modality of worship, his reading of
reality, that has haunted Jacob throughout his life.

240
VA-YISHLAH
The nodal experience is, Ramban asserts, the "Akedah day," the
existential dread that he lived on that day he was bound in sacrifice to
God. As Jacob begins his journey down to Egypt, he has agonized
premonitions of the exile and slavery of his children; he offers sacrifices —
specifically, peace offerings (zevahim or sbelamim)—to the God of his
father Isaac, who is known in dread and blind anguish. He engages fully
with that dread, and prays that it may be moderated in him, that he may
find a new vital equilibrium.
Jacob is the first person to offer such peace offerings, expressing his
longing for peace, for wholeness. But in order to realize that desire, he
must begin with the difficult, the overwhelming experience, of his  
immediate precursor, his father. He must, in Bloom's terms, compound with
Isaac's reality; only then can he seek to balance the fear, the sense of
mystery and complexity, in which the human is dwarfed, with the  
opposing sense of besed, of love, connection, spontaneous expansion and
encounter with all that exists. This search for equilibrium, for a sense of
his "own quick'ning power,"48 Ramban calls the search for "truth." It is
consummated through sacrifice, through "peace offerings," which  
generate a new revelation of God, in a "vision by night" —a revelation of
modified dread, irradiated by hope and promise.
struggle for stability
On this reading, Jacob's life is a struggle to synthesize, to "misread"
strongly, the lives of his precursors. He knows the "crippling sense of
belatedness," of coming after the originators. He is shadowed by the
stringent agony of his father, while he wants to realize the possibility of
love, of compassion, of imaginative connection.49 But only through a
certain sacrifice, suggested in the need to "make good" on vows (le-
shalem, "pay off," "make whole"), can he engage with and transcend the
crippling psychology of belatedness.
This is the core irony. In order to overcome the debilitating anxiety of
his belatedness, Jacob must expose himself to fear, to face-to-face  
encounter with what he most dreads. He must confront the nameless horror
of the man who grips him, binds him arm and leg, if he is to acquire the
partial freedom of a limping hero, who has learned his new name—and,
incidentally, the mirror identity of the face of his dread. He comes to
know his courage and his vulnerability, simultaneously. The sun that

The Quest far Wholeness
241
rises "for him" may, indeed, as the midrash claims, bring him healing;
but still he limps, even as the sun shines for him. He has gained and lost, a
paradigm experience that sets the tone for his whole life, and for the lives
of his descendants.
What he has gained, primarily, is courage: the "conviction that they
with whom you contend are no more than you." He contends, essentially,
with himself, with his dread, his sense of evil,50 his need to control and
structure a cogent world, safe from the mystery of his father's binding.
Seeking wholeness, he struggles for a new sense of the good, that will
endure through all evil.
"I am too small," he cries to God, before engaging with Esau, "for all
the kindnesses [hasadim] and all the truth [emet]" (32:11). Strangely, the
Targum translates emet as tavevon ("goodness"). Ramban suggests that
the kindnesses may refer to all the episodes of rescue, the acts of grace, by
which God mysteriously intervenes in Jacob's life; while the word emet
refers to the enduring goodness of his life, the stable consciousness that
does not change with time and vicissitude. "I am too small," says Jacob,
with modesty and, perhaps, with realism. His whole life will be a struggle
to grow, to achieve the stability, the wholeness for which he yearns.
"You said," he reminds God in his prayer, " 'I will deal with you in
great goodness' "(32:13). God, in fact, did not say this: He never spoke of
goodness in relation to Jacob, who twice speaks of God's "goodness," in
the course of a short prayer (32:10,13). Jacob "misreads" God's promise:
he interprets in the way most vital to him the words, "I shall be with
you,"51 since what he most desires is that enduring consciousness of the
goodness of God that permeates and integrates a life.
The SefatEmet makes the point elegantly: "I will deal with you (imkha)
in great goodness" suggests that God promises Jacob that his sense of his
own life will share in the experience of God's goodness.52 God will not
merely be good to Jacob: He will make Jacob accomplice in the benign
self-creation of Israel.
A strong goodness —a paradoxical, "whole" condition in which  
passion and subtlety, safety and love are interfused: Jacob-Israel plays many
variations on this basic theme to the end of his life. Emet— truth—in this
sense is not overnight work: to encounter an angel is not to be healed for
ever. Jacob's instinct to delay, to defer encounter, to lie in wait and be
wise, is to be tempered by much experience of solitude and encounter.

242
VA-YISHLAH
But this dialectical mode of learning has the very texture of human
freedom: "You hedge me before and behind; You lay Your hand upon
me" (Psalms 139:5).53 God's hand laid on man in creation set him apart
from all other creatures, according to Rashi (1:27); they were made "by
His word," determined, made precisely according to His will, while man
was formed out of the symbolic freedom of the unmediated creative
process.54 Rashi quotes this verse from Psalms, in his commentary on the
creation of man, to sharpen the contrast between the human and the
nonhuman, between freedom and determinism.
The first part of the verse, equally, I suggest, evokes the peculiar
process by which human beings are created. Ahor and kedem ("Behind
and before"): between delay, belatedness, anxiety, and structure, on the
one hand, and spontaneity, courage, and passionate encounter, on the
other, the human being is besieged, challenged, pressed by God's hand.
The image conveys all the tension of a condition both constrained and —
strangely—free.55 Invisibly to the naked eye, Jacob dances in place, the
human dance in which he assumes the multiple postures between fore
and aft, passion and deliberation, love and fear.

VA-YESHEV W
Re-membering
the Dismembered
The quest for peace
Now Jacob was settled in the land where his father had sojourned, the
land of Canaan. (37:1)
The narrative of Jacob's later life, after his return to Canaan, is
ironically captioned by this opening verse. From the earliest midrashic
commentaries, microscopic attention has been paid to the apparently
innocuous opening— and titular—word of the Parsha—va-yeshev. On the
surface a neutral account of Jacob's "settling down" in the Holy Land,
after twenty years' exile in Padan Aram, the verse, the verb, has classically
been read as resonant with forebodings, with a sense that Jacob has fatally
misread the structure, the plot, the moral motifs of his own life: " 'Jacob
was settled9: Jacob sought to settle in peace —there leapt upon him the
agitation of Joseph. The righteous seek to settle in peace — God says, 'Is it
not enough for the righteous, what is prepared for them in the world to
come, that they seek to settle in peace in this world?'"!
There is a poignant undertow to the word va-yeshev, as Rashi reads it.
Quite reasonably, in the way that all righteous people do —the statement
about the desire for peace is unqualified (without "if" or "when")—Jacob
would like to settle his life, to find some measure of tranquillity after all
his troubles. One might even say that it is characteristic of righteous
people to yearn for such a "settling," a clarification of the turbulences and
anguish of life. But God rebuffs this yearning, in a tone of strange
sarcasm: "Is it not enough?" In God's rhetoric, the righteous are made to
seem importunate, almost greedy, their desire for peace in this world
wrongheaded, in view of the treasure awaiting them in another world.
243

244
VA-YESHEV
Neither Rashi nor his source midrash speaks of "peace," as the nature
of "what is prepared" in the world-to-come; so that one cannot read this
as simply a matter of actuarial computation— as though a certain measure
of peace were allocated to the righteous, who may not overdraw on their
this-worldly allowance. God simply asks an ironic, enigmatic question
about the desire of the righteous, and implicitly answers by the savage
"leap upon him" of "the agitation [rogez] of Joseph." What is the
meaning of God's question, of His implicit reproach to the righteous,
and, specifically, to Jacob?
We may perhaps find some clue to understanding in a phrase in the
source midrash: "When the righteous settle in peace — and seek to settle
in peace —in this world, Satan comes to accuse them."2 Subtly, the
midrash indicates a possible imbalance in the attitude of the righteous.
Given a time of tranquillity, they discover in themselves a passion for
tranquillity—they seek to settle in peace —which arouses the anger of
Satan. (Compare Rashi's version, where it is God, judicious and  
unanswerable, who criticizes the universal desire of righteous people for
peace.) In the original midrash, the righteous make themselves  
vulnerable to Satan's attack, they release a certain force of evil in the world, by
their overweening desire to settle, to discern, in this world, the innate
structure of meaning in their lives.
If we respond to this nuance in the midrash, we understand that it is
not wrong to "settle in peace," but to seek, with too great a need, such a
"settling." The quest for peace is problematic: Rashi telescopes the text
of the midrash, assuming that the emphasis on "seeking" is abundantly
evident. What he changes is the speaker of reproach — it is not Satan, but
God, who asks the ironic question; it is not so much evil as misjudgment
that is at issue in Rashi's reading.
Taking the emphasis on "quest for peace" into account, Jacob's  
"settling" becomes not a fact, but an attitude, a mode in which he seeks to
appropriate his life. In the most obvious sense, he would like to "settle
down" in the Holy Land, after his years in exile and danger. He would like
to read the narrative of his own life as entering a period of fulfillment, of
closure, after the difficult conflicts and confrontations of his youth.
Y\.eading history: the desire for aesthetic composure
Possibly, too, he would like to read the history of his family as having
arrived at its consummation. Perhaps the promise to Abraham, "between

Re-membering the Dismembered
245
the pieces" (15:13-16), a promise heavy with exile, slavery and suffering
but culminating in eventual redemption, is to be realized in this latter
period of his life?
"And Jacob was settled': Jacob speculated, "God said to Abraham that
his children would be 'sojourners'— I have been a 'sojourner' for
twenty years in the house of Laban, 'enslaved1 to the care of his sheep."
And when he saw that Esau had gone to live in another city, he said,
"With this, the 400 years' slavery is fulfilled," and his mind was settled.
But God said, "My thoughts are deeper than yours, as it said, 'For My
thoughts are not your thoughts'" [Isaiah 55:8], and immediately
brought upon him the plot [alilah] of Joseph's story. When did He
bring this plot upon him? When he thought there would be no slavery
in Egypt and his mind became setded—"Now Jacob was setded."3
Jacob tries to interpret history in the light of God's promise. God had
spoken of sojourning, alienation in "a land not theirs" —Jacob had indeed
been exiled to a land not his. Precisely as God had specified in His
covenant, He had been enslaved (the word la'avod [to work] is a leitwvrt of
the narrative of his relation to Laban) and afflicted (31:42). And the four
hundred years clearly does not represent a fixed sum of years in Egypt,
even in the normal reckoning of the fulfillment of the Covenant: God
"calculated the end" of slavery; in accord with His desire to make it
bearable, He began the calculation with the birth of Isaac (Rashi, 15:13),
who all his life is characterized as a "sojourner."
The family history of alienation in a "land not theirs" is, therefore, not
confined to the Egyptian episode. Even in Canaan, Isaac was a "stranger,"
unable to appropriate the land. In the view of this midrash, then, Jacob's
speculation is quite plausible: if God can reduce the 400-year exile to 210,
allowing for the broadest definition of exile to cover the 400-year  
stipulation, then He can reduce it still further, so that the rootlessness of the
patriarchs will be read retroactively as having fulfilled the terms of
covenantal suffering. Jacob's clue is the fact that Esau has left the Holy
Land, to find his own separate destiny: this seems to indicate the end of
the vicissitudes of the Covenant. Now, "Jacob's mind was settled": things
seemed to fall into proper perspective, a kind of clarity and coherence
invested the narrative of family history, as he set himself to read it. God,
however, reads the plot differently. However plausible Jacob's reading
may seem, however satisfying aesthetically and cognitively, he has to face

246
VA-YESHEV
the shock of participation in a very different "plot." The story of Joseph is
that shock that rouses Jacob from his aesthetic composure.
If Jacob craves a certain gratification that is hinted at in the word va-
yesbev, yet the moral criticism implicit in Rashi's reading— "It is not
enough for the righteous" —remains enigmatic. After all, the desire for
cogency— for yishuv ba-da9at, as the midrash calls it— is normally praised
in rabbinic literature: "The older they grow, the more clear-minded they
grow."4 Yishuv ha-da'at is opposed to tiruf ha-da9at— literally, to be of
torn mind —to be confused, bewildered, not fully conscious. This is a
question of order as against disorder, clarity as against confusion.
More pointedly, it is a question of composition, of composure. To be
able to connect the parts of an experience, of a text into a cogent whole, is
the task of the writer, the artist, the critic; it is properly, Rashi says
(Psalms 16:7), in quite a different context, the task of the reader of sacred
texts: "'My conscience [lit., kidneys] admonish me at night9 The sages
applied this to Abraham, who learned Torah from his own experience
(from his inward parts), before it was revealed at Sinai. So we too should
[lit.] settle [yashev] the texts in order."
Rashi comments here on his own lifework; his primary concern in
reading Torah is the discovery of order, which, as in Abraham's pre-Sinai
experience, is never given entirely. It has to emerge out of one's own
kidneys, in the bizarre image of the midrash:5 one has to undergo the
torments of wakeful darkness to "create" Torah, to find, in the intimate
encounter between reader and text, a new composition of the elements.
The satisfaction, the composure that results from such a "settling" is not
merely innocent but, even Rashi seems to assert, an ideal condition of
being: "so we too should settle. . . ."
In view of this, Jacob's attempt to resolve, to "read" the text of God's
covenant in the light of his own life seems impeccable. And yet, as we have
seen, God does not merely override Jacob's reading (as in the above
midrash), but—much more radically—He mocks such an attempt,  
wherever it occurs, as vulgar misreading, a lack of aesthetic tact.
The opening verse seems to contrast Jacob's desire to "settle," to
interpret his life and God's word, with the "sojournings" of his father,
Isaac. The provisional, God-directed quality of his father's life has been
replaced by a new enterprise in Jacob's life — the enterprise that the
kabbalists called emet—truth. Jacob wants to read the family texts strongly,
to synthesize the contrasting elements of his father's and his grand-

Re-membering the Dismembered
247
father's worlds. In a word, Jacob wants to compose a whole world of his
own: "He sought to settle in peace" indicates a cognitive and aesthetic
ambition to see history resolved, sojournings over, in this world. What
"leaps upon him" is the wild animal that tears Joseph apart—taro/tora/\*
Yosef. Instead of yishuv ba-da'at, clarity, composure, coherence, there is
tiruf ha-dayat, confusion, bewilderment, loss of consciousness.
Joseph story: turbulence and cruelty
It is in this sense that the opening, titular word of the Parsha—va-yeshev—
puts into play a concept, a human desire, that is immediately—and
literally—savaged. The chapter that tells of Joseph's being sold into
slavery by his brothers, chapter 37, begins with va-yeshev and ends with
tarcf toraf Jacob has attempted a reading that proves to be woefully
wrong. From a human perspective, there seems to be an irreducible
disorder in things. No elegant composure can veil the organic disease of
this world. And the full tension of composure and discomposure, of yishuv
and tiruf, is felt most acutely by the righteous, by those whose sense of
beauty, whose desire for harmony, exposes them to the shock of reality.
The point is made in Rashi's first comment on the Parsha. He  
contrasts the account of Esau's toledot— his children and descendants —with
that of Jacob's toledot. (The two accounts are consecutive —the previous
Parsha ended with Esau's genealogy, culminating in many generations of
kings, "before there ever was a king in Israel" [36:31].)
"And Jacob was settled": After narrating the settlings of Esau and his
children, in a brief manner—because they were not distinguished or
important enough to explain how they settled down and the order of
their wars, how they dispossessed the Hurrites—the Torah explains
the setdings of Jacob and his children, in a fall way, all the changes in
their fortunes, since they were significant before God to relate them at
length. So you find also with the ten generations from Adam to
Noah—"So and so begat so and so," but when it comes to Noah, the
text deals with him at length. So, too, with the ten generations from
Noah to Abraham—they are covered briefly and only Abraham is
described at length.
The main difference between the two accounts of settlings and  
offspring is a matter of length. Esau's children produce children in no more
time than it takes to read the words on the page; Esau himself "settles in

248
VA-YESHEV
the hill country of Seir" (36:8), with equal, uncomplicated promptitude.
The narrator is simply not interested enough to give us the complexities
of a story of settlings and childbearings. When it comes to Jacob and his
toledot, hisyishuvim, however, the story is told in all its complication, in all
the terrible, heart-stopping details. The turnings of the wheel of fortune,
the wrenching reversals of the plot, which—retroactively— can be seen to
create a chain of causality, all this is given in full, circumstantial detail in
Jacob's case.
The difference between the two narratives, however, is clearly more
than a matter of length. The real issue is one of importance. Esau's family
is not, literally, worth thinking about {hashuvim), their lives resolve
themselves predictably and simply; there are no secret areas (sefimim), no
crevices out of which God can speak. They settle down in their own
country; they bear children; they even produce kings—exemplars of
national coherence —many generations before Jacob's children are ready
to do so.
Jacob's children are individual, unique, unclassifiable. The story of
their "settling" is a long and tortuous process:
"These are the toledot of Jacob" (37:2): These are the stories of the
children of Jacob—these are their settlings and their vicissitudes—till
they arrived at the reality of settlement. The first cause was, "Joseph
was seventeen years old . . .": as a consequence of that, they went through
many turns of fate until they went down to Egypt. (Rashi, 37:2)
Rashi here offers an answer to the problem of the word toledot. He
insists that it refers to Jacob's children6 (even though only Joseph is
listed), but that eileh — "these" — refers back to the key word va-yeshev: it
signifies the zig-zag processes, by which Jacob's children finally arrived at
the point called yisbuv — full settlement. This concept of process exerts
explosive pressure on the surface meaning of the word va-yeshev. In Esau's
case, it is indeed true to say, simply and flatly, that he "settled down." In
Jacob's case, Rashi implies, a discomposed, unsettled movement of lives,
relationships, and locations begins here.
This turbulence — Rashi's word gilgul, for example, refers to a field full
of hills and depressions—ultimately leads to resolution, to a resettling in
the land of Canaan. But this will be many years later, more than 250 years
later, after much suffering, much turbulence in the story line.  
Interpretation in the midst of history will not be easy; and in a sense, the whole

Re-membering the Dismembered
249
Torah is narrated in the midst of the turbulent process of history. Arrival
at the Promised Land, the full settlement of which Rashi speaks, is always
in the future, promised, imagined, but, within the framework of the
biblical narrative proper, never consummated.
Jacob's settling is a long story, it is also a story of contingency and
cruelty that tears apart the elegant closure that Jacob speculated he could
read in his own lifetime. But for this very reason, paradoxically, Jacob and
his children are called sefunim va-basbuvim. They are substantial,  
complicated, with secret potentialities, which take time to explore.
Jacob and Esau: the choice of alienation
Rashi conveys a further sense of the contrasting destinies of Jacob and
Esau, in his comment on Esau's choice of territory (36:6-7):
"Esau went to another land [lit., to a land] because of his brother Jacob.
For their possessions were too many for them to dwell together."
Because of his brother Jacob, because of the writ of obligation of the
decree, "for a stranger will be your seed" [15:13], which was placed on
the seed of Isaac. Esau said, "Let me go away from here, I have no part
either in the gift, for this land was given to him, or in paying the
obligation."
Esau leaves for "a land": the strange indefinite article indicates that his
main urge is to remove himself from Canaan and Jacob, to find a place to
settle, wherever it may be. He rejects any share in the Covenant between
the Pieces; he will have neither the gift of the land nor the suffering
preceding it. The Covenant is, interestingly, represented as a writ of
obligation: it represents something to be paid, to be worked through, its
elements dismantled, torn open, uncovered (lifro Ja has all these nuances
of meaning). Through time, through the 400-year period specified by
God, a process of analysis and testing is to take place; only after that
process has been lived through can the Land be possessed. Esau wants no
part of the process of piecemeal self-realization and ultimate gift. He
chooses instead the instant gratification: "So Esau settled in the hill-
country of Seir—Esau being Edom" (36:8).
Another midrash fleshes out Esau's choice:
Esau said to Jacob, Let us divide all that father has left us into two parts,
and I shall choose my share, for I am the elder. What did Jacob do? He

250
VA-YESHEV
divided the property: all that his father had left, as one part, and the
Land of Israel, as the other part. What did Esau do? He went to consult
Ishmael, in the desert, as it is said, "So Esau went to Ishmael" [28:9].
Ishmael said to Esau, The Emorites and the Canaanites are now in
possession of the land, and Jacob trusts that he will inherit the land!
Take all that your father left you, and Jacob will be left with nothing! So
Esau took all that his father left him, and the Land of Israel and the
Cave of Makhpelah he gave to Jacob, and they wrote an eternally valid
contract between them. And Esau took his wives and all his property,
as it is said, "He went to another land because of his brother Jacob"
[36:6]. As a reward for removing all his things from Jacob's land, he
received a hundred states, from Seir to Magdiel.7
Esau takes the issue of inheritance under advisement. In worldly
terms, his decision is shrewd: he takes all that the world can immediately
offer him and leaves Jacob nothing to take hold of, no eretz ahuzah, such
as Esau's descendants, spread over a hundred states, with kings and
princes to lead them, are granted.
"These are the chiefs of Edom ... by their settlements in the land
which they hold" (36:43). So reads the verse that precedes "Now Jacob
was settled." Seeing his brother's destiny, the tangible power and  
coherence of his world, Jacob seeks the same security in the land where his
father had accepted a provisional, wandering existence.8 But the writ has
not yet been paid off. Jacob has chosen the Land, and with it he has
chosen a distinctly unsettled existence:
"So Jacob was settled"-. Esau's princes settled in the land of "their
holding" — that is, in the land they took hold of, as an everlasting
possession. But Jacob lived as a sojourner, like his father, in a land not
theirs but Canaan's. This means that they chose to live as sojourners in
the chosen land, and that "Strangers shall your seed be in a land not
theirs" was fulfilled in them, and not in Esau, for Jacob alone  
represents the seed of calling.9
Ramban's reading of the word va-yeshev fades it into the associations of
"his father's sojournings": his father's essential modality is continued
into Jacob's life, and, Ramban emphasizes, constitutes an existential
choice of a profoundly paradoxical nature. The Land is chosen by God;
but it is also chosen by Isaac and Jacob. They choose to sojourn in it,
although it is "not theirs." Here, Ramban executes an astonishing sleight-
of-hand: God had warned Abraham of a 400-years' exile in a "land not

Re-membering the Dismembered
251
theirs," clearly—or, at least, with the clarity of hindsight—referring to
the Israelite slavery in Egypt. But Ramban adopts the coinage of  
alienation for the patriarchs' experience of the Holy Land: it is Canaan that is
the "land not theirs," the land in which they are strangers.
Technically, of course, this is no novel idea, since it forms the basis for
the classic understanding that the 400-years' exile began with the birth of
Isaac (Rashi 15:13). But Ramban's comment goes far beyond the  
technical. Isaac and Jacob make a choice of a certain kind of existence—
squatters in a land not possessed by them. And they are contrasted in this
with Esau—who takes fast hold of his land, and who, in that very act,
disqualifies himself from the "seed of calling." The paradox is manifest:
Ramban, unlike Rashi, emphasizes the free choice of a rootless existence
in the Holy Land, and not the search for peace or stability. What
identifies the seed of destiny is the capacity to choose a troubled,  
unsettled life, with nothing in one's hand.
The contrasting destinies of Esau and Jacob, therefore, are plotted on
a graph of "settledness." Va-yesbev marks the divergence of the two lines,
the choice of immediate realization and appropriation, on the one hand,
or the ambiguous endowment of suffering and ultimate gift, on the other.
This is Ramban's understanding of Jacob's va-yesbev: he "settles for" the
long way, the way of a complex, "significant" race, whose potential
energies are to be discovered through a history of extreme experience. By
accepting responsibility for the "writ of obligation," Jacob chooses the
process rather than the fact of "settling": the many turns of the wheel, the
unlikely causalities, the unpromising beginnings.
The midrashic notion of a contract under which Jacob and Esau
assume separate destinies is referred to again, at a significant moment in
Jewish history. Before entering the Promised Land, after forty years'
wandering in the wilderness, the people send messengers to the king of
Edom, descendants of Esau: "Thus says your brother Israel: You know all
the hardships that have befallen us; that our ancestors went down to
Egypt, that we dwelt in Egypt a long time, and that the Egyptians dealt
harshly with us and our ancestors. . . . Allow us, then, to cross your
country" (Numbers 20:14-15, 17). Rashi quotes the midrash:
"Your brother Israel": Why did Moses mention brotherhood here?
Moses told him, We are brothers, children of Abraham, who was told,
"A sojourner shall be your offspring." That writ was laid on both of us
to pay off

252
VA-YESHEV
"You know all the hardships": for this reason, your father separated from
our father, "and he went to another land, because of his brother
Jacob" —because of the writ of obligation that was laid on them, and
that he left Jacob to carry.
"The Egyptians dealt harshly with us": we suffered many troubles.
"Allow uSy then, to cross your country": you have no grounds for appeal
about our inheritance of the Land of Israel, since you did not pay off the
writ of obligation.
Rashi conveys a sense of the burden of destiny: Esau reneged on his
share in this complex destiny, and has therefore no legitimate claim to its
promise, while Jacob has been left to bear its full weight. Free choice is
not the emphasis here; unlike Ramban, Rashi depicts an almost  
involuntary endurance of a divine decree. The midrashic narrative gives us an
Esau who sidesteps this destiny, leaving Jacob to endure all its painful
implications.
It seems, therefore, that there are two different emphases in the
midrashic tradition, which are expressed in the two commentaries of
Rashi and Ramban. In one reading—that of Rashi and Bereshit Rab-
bah10—a. writ of obligation, the Covenant of the Pieces, with its drama of
frustration and gift, is imposed on Abraham's family. Jacob is compelled
to pay the full amount, since his brother has opted out of the family's
responsibilities. In the other reading— that of Ramban and Pirkei d'Rabbi
Eliezer—there is a voluntary assumption by Jacob of the experience of the
Land of Israel, which, by its very nature, involves unsettledness, a life
lived not by the grip of the hand, but by the words of the promise.
Inexorable causality
It is this latter view, with its strange notion of freedom, that teases us out
of thought. For the idea that Jacob chooses the modality of indirection, of
volatile vicissitude, is contradicted by a central motif in the midrashic
readings of the Joseph narrative. Rashi, for instance, speaks of a  
concatenation of events, an inexorable causality: "The first cause was, 'Joseph
was seventeen years old.' As a result of this, they had to turn around and
go down to Egypt" (37:2). The apparent disaster, the misdirection, of the
family's emigration to Egypt, is precipitated by a "first cause" (the term
ironically plays on the Aristotelian notion of the Prime Mover, the great

Re-membering the Dismembered
253
"cause of causes," that sets all the spheres in motion): the fact of Joseph's
youth, his father's special love for him, his brothers' jealousy and hatred.
In the family narrative, what sets the wheels turning is the fact that
Joseph was seventeen, a na yar, a youth, immature in his management of
relationships. (The Baal Ha-Turim notes that na'ar and sboteh [fool] have
the same numerical value!) The word implies much more than biological
age (that, as Mizrahi points out, is already given): Joseph behaves with the
narcissism of youth, with a dangerous unawareness of the inner worlds of
others.
Later, the butler will tell Pharaoh of the dream interpreter in prison,
describing him as a na yar ivri, a Jewish lad; on which Rashi comments:
"This is a disparaging term, meaning, fool, unfit for greatness" (41:12).
Joseph has greatness thrust upon him, before the day is out—which
seems to indicate that his na'ar nature has matured considerably, as a
result of his adventures. And yet, apparently, there is a na yar quality that
accompanies him throughout his vicissitudes, and that, in his early life,
explosively combines with his cleverness and closeness to his father.
("Son of his old age," as quoted by Rashi [37:3], is read midrashically to
refer to his wisdom, his direct tutorial relationship with his father's
intellectual tradition, his clonelike resemblance to his father.) He is a
child prodigy, prematurely knowledgeable, devastatingly unaware.
Joseph's growing wisdom is indicated by an apparently minor detail:
he becomes sensitive to people's faces, to their changing expressions.
When the butler and the baker meet him on the day after their dreams, he
asks them, "Why do you appear downcast today?" (40:7). Instead of
launching into a direct account of their dreams, the text records this
trivial question, to make a point about sensitivity: "for this is the way of
the wise person, to ask his companion, why his face looks different today
from other days."11 Joseph's progress in sensitivity to the human face,
which hides and reveals invisible worlds, is a token of the deepening of his
wisdom.
But it is his clever folly, his narcissism, which precipitates the narrative
crisis. First causes, trivial, oblique data—youth, precocity,  
unawareness—lead to exile and slavery. Rashi emphasizes the inexorable chain of
events. Behind him stands a powerful midrashic tradition that emphasizes
the fatality of human life, and God's manipulation of human passions and
follies.

254
VA-YESHEV
It is in view of this tradition that Ramban's insistence that Jacob chose
the life of alienation, or the motif in Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer of a deliberately
worded contract in which Jacob assumes the burdens of the Covenant of
the Pieces, seems enigmatic. The element of free choice seems tenuous in
this narrative, particularly in the perspective of midrashic readings.
KJod's plot
Perhaps the most powerful midrash in this fatalistic vein, for example —
the midrash that poses the most provocative challenge to the concept of
human freedom—is this passage in Tanbuma, 4:
"And Joseph was brought dawn to Egypt" [39:1]: This is an example of
"Come and see the works of God, who is held in awe by men for His
acts" [Psalms 66:5]. Even the awesome [lit., terrible] things that You
bring upon us, You bring through a plot [alilab, translated here as
"acts"]. Come and see: when God created the world, from the first day,
He created the Angel of Death—"with darkness over the surface of the
deep" [1:2]—that is the Angel of Death, who darkens the faces of
human beings. And Adam was created on the sixth day and a pretext
[alilab—lit., plot] was found to blame him for bringing death to the
world, as it is said, "As soon as you eat of it, you shall die" [2:17]. This is
like a man who wants to divorce his wife, and, before going home,
writes a bill of divorce. He enters his house with the divorce in his hand,
and seeks a pretext [alilab] to give it to her. He asks her for a cup of
beverage, and she pours it for him. As he takes the cup from her, he says,
"Here is your divorce." She says, "What have I done wrong?" He
says, "Leave my house, for you have poured me a lukewarm drink!" She
says, "But you knew that I would pour you a lukewarm drink, for you
had already written the divorce bill and brought it in your hand!" In
the same way, Adam said to God, "Master of the Universe, before
You created Your world, two thousand years ago, the Torah was as a
confidant with You . . . and in the Torah, it is written, This is the
ritual: When a person dies in a tent. . .' [Numbers 19:14]. If You had
not already planned death for Your creatures, would You have written
this in the Torah? But You came to me with a pretext to make me
responsible for death—'terrible to man are Your plots.'". . .
God wanted to fulfill the decree of "Know well that your offspring
shall be strangers in a land not theirs" (15:13), so He brought about the
plot of all this narrative, so that Jacob should love Joseph, and his
brothers should hate him, and sell him to the Ishmaelites, who would

Re-membering the Dismembered
255
bring him down to Egypt. Do not read, "Joseph was brought down
to Egypt," but "Joseph brought his father and brothers down to
Egypt.". . . This is like a cow whose owners want to place a yoke on her
neck. She refuses the yoke, so what do they do? They take her calf away
from her, and pull him to the field they want ploughed. The calf
bellows for his mother, who hears and involuntarily follows her son. In
the same way, God sought to fulfill the decree of the Covenant, so He
engineered the plot of this whole narrative, and the family went down
to Egypt and paid off the writ—"Terrible to man are Your plots."
The striking characteristic of the midrash is its conscious bitterness
about God's relationship to human autonomy. Centering on the concept
of alilah, "plot," the midrash evokes complex responses. For the word
works on multiple levels of meaning: the plot of a story, a malicious
stratagem to entrap the victim—as well as simply the causality through
which one plans the future. The latter, neutral meaning is overshadowed
by a sinister quality on the other two levels. (This meaning-complex
works in both Hebrew and English: alilah and "plot" both suggest
manipulation, as the Author moves his material, characters, feelings, and
events, to His own will.)
The midrash presents human beings as participants in a drama of
God's devising. Though ultimately not malicious, God's intents are
inexorable, and human beings are for the most part unconscious actors in
His plot. How is the Author to get His characters down to Egypt? He
achieves His plot-purposes, through a realistic technique of apparent
freedoms —freedom to love, to hate, to kill, to sell into slavery. This
apparent life-likeness granted to the characters is, however, only a tribute
to the skill of the Author. In reality, all is decided ahead of time. Human
life is instrumental — like the cow, whose maternal passion is manipulated
to bring her just where her master wants her, human beings feel and act—
and may never themselves realize to what purposes they have been used.
"It is possible to be in a plot and not understand it," writes Thomas
Mann of the "God-story."12 More than possible, one might add: it is of
the very nature of life inside an alilah, inside a plot, that one does not
understand its whole structure. The wife who is handed the divorce is
acute enough to observe that her husband must have determined  
beforehand to give her the divorce. But this homely parable sets up the basic
tension of the midrash: the husband has not in any way deceived or
compelled his wife into failure. He simply set the scene for her to do what

256
VA-YESHEV
she presumably tends to do —he knows that she usually prepares  
lukewarm drinks! His knowledge of her habitual responses opens up a plot-
possibility that enables him to give her the divorce, without being
unfaithful to the demands of realism. The analogy with the plotting of a
good dramatist, however, does not make his behavior any the less sinister.
This, it seems, is the essential point of the midrash. God is the
omniscient, skillful Narrator, whose plot rests, apparently without  
artifice, on the plausible motivations of His characters. And yet, there is a
peculiar and subtle horror in such a perspective. For God not only fulfills
His own intentions through the agency of human beings; He also makes
them feel, through His plot-stratagems, fully responsible.
There comes a moment when the unconsciousness of the character is
superseded by knowledge: the woman understands what her husband had
intended, Adam resorts to complex exegesis of texts, to convey his sense
that he is both responsible for death, and a mere instrument executing
God's prior determination to bring death to the world. And Joseph, at the
very end of the narrative (45:5, 8; 50:19-20), speaks ambiguously of
God's thoughts and human thoughts, of responsibility and fatality.
But this moment of anagnorisis, of retroactive knowledge, in the first
two cases, at any rate, is full of disenchantment, as the reality of the
experience is undermined in the light of the revealed plot. It is interesting
that in both cases, written texts reveal the script of the plot—the divorce
bill serves as evidence of prior intention, while the Torah text, preceding
all life and contingency, tells of God's original invention of death. Human
beings suddenly perceive their lives as less real than the written texts that
they have been manipulated to enact. Even when Joseph offers his
brothers his observations about God's thoughts, His turning of evil to
good, as consolation, as an alleviation of their torturing guilt, the notion
of being actors in an alilah is not without its chilling aspect.
The question of the freedom and responsibility available to those
involved in an alilah is evoked in a classic midrashic hyperbole: "Jacob,
our father, should have gone down to Egypt in chains and iron collar, but
God said, 'He is my first-born son—shall I bring him down in shame? . . .
I shall draw his son down before him, and he will go down after him,
unawares, and he will bring God's presence down with him to Egypt.' "I3
Here, the cow-calf parable is explicitly applied to Jacob and Joseph.
Jacob in chains—the image evokes horror and humiliation. Prometheus,
chained to the rock, his liver endlessly torn by vultures, provides one

Re-membering the Dismembered
257
analogy—helpless, unjustly tormented. But since the biblical Author has
ends in view, other than simple retribution for hubris, He chooses a less
brutal, a less direct way of bringing Jacob down to Egypt.
In the terms of the midrash, dignity is related to privacy: Jacob will go
down to Egypt obeying his own personal motivations, not publicly
humiliated by Pharaoh's blatant power. But exactly how dignified is this
descent, in fact? In what sense is it better to go down as a result of a plot
that has evoked so much pain and loss —involving betrayals, quasi-
fratricide, and incarcerations in pit and prison—than simply to "go down
in chains"?
The question seems to relate to the basic contrast between the short
and long way of telling a story. The short, summary way of achieving the
novelist's ends is to apply whatever fictional artifice may be necessary to
move one's characters about. The hand of the author rests heavy on his
work, in such a case. Deus ex machina becomes not merely a technique for
mechanically resolving the ending of the story, but a continual resource
at every juncture of the plot. When God comes to deal with significant,
complex people, on the other hand, their substantiality demands a  
different approach. God's plot is not set aside, but is molded to the shape of
their personalities, of their uniqueness. The sheer length and privacy of
Jacob's sufferings, the complication of the devices used to move him to
Egypt, is a tribute to the massiveness of his personhood.
The problem of authentic, autonomous life and the concept of "God's
plot" is basic to midrashic understandings of the Joseph story. To seek to
"settle in peace" is, on one level, to seek an ordering of experience, a
personal construction of one's own reality, that should be both coherent
and realistic. It is, in effect, to articulate the narrative of one's own life.
This is, in an aesthetic, or even an epistemological sense, Jacob's desire;
but, sparing no sarcasm, God thwarts his desire. For God has His
counternarrative; and it is in the space between the two narratives that
Jacob stands, a Job-like figure, suffering losses on many levels.
jacob as Job: consummated anxiety
"When suddenly a scourge brings death, He mocks as the innocent
fail" [Job 9:23]: Antoninus asked Rav, What is the meaning of this?
Rav answered, This is like a king who decreed that one of his people
receive a hundred blows of the whip, and be given a hundred dinars—
the same amount of dinars as blows: if he accepted the blows, he would

258
VA-YESHEV
get the dinars, but if he could not bear the pain, or died in the middle,
he would receive nothing, and seem ludicrous for enduring the blows
for nothing—"He mocks as the innocent fail." When the righteous
settle in peace, and seek to settle in peace in this world, Satan comes
and accuses them. He says, Is it not enough what is prepared for them
in the world-to-come, but they seek to settle in peace in this world?
Know that it is so; because Jacob sought to settle in peace in this world,
and Satan leapt upon him with the agitation of Joseph. "Now Jacob was
settled"; but "I had no repose, no quiet" —no repose from Esau, no
quiet from Laban, "no rest" from Dinah, "and agitation came" [Job
3:26]— there came upon him the agitation of Joseph.14
The human condition is imagined as a kind of endurance test, on a
win-all, lose-all basis. Job cries out against universal fate: "It is all one;
therefore I say, He destroys the blameless and the guilty" (9:22). There
seems to be no moral discrimination: if the righteous seem to live longer
than the wicked (8:21-22), then their lives are a protracted torment,
which may turn out to have been suffered in vain. It may be preferable,
indeed, to die suddenly, like the wicked, than to suffer the whips and
scorpions of outrageous fortune, like Job in all his innocence.
The ending of the midrash provides us with the key to the connection
between Job and Jacob: "I had no repose, no quiet, no rest, and agitation
came" (Job 3:26). Jacob ventriloquizes Job's cry of long suffering, which
expresses an essential motif of his own life. The context of Job's protest
about restlessness is significant: it comes at the end of a chapter of radical
despair, chapter 3, where Job's sense of malaise, of feeling mal dans sa
peauy is traced back to the very moment of his conception: "Perish the day
on which I was bom, and the night it was announced" (3:3). He wishes
darkness and oblivion had fallen on the world before he was born: "Why
did I not die at birth, expire as I came forth from the womb? Why were
there knees to receive me, or breasts for me to suck? For now I would be
lying in repose, asleep and at rest" (3:11-12). Wishing for death, Job
imagines peace: "There the wicked cease from troubling [rogez,
"agitation"]; there rest those whose strength is spent" (3:17). All of life  
becomes a tormented gasping for release; even the mother's breasts and
knees become sinister decoys to a world of suffering.
Job finishes this, perhaps his most radically nihilistic chapter, with a
strange coda —the words that the midrash puts into Jacob's mouth: "For
what I feared has overtaken me; What I dreaded has come upon me.

Re-membering the Dismembered
259
I had no repose, no quiet, no rest, And trouble [rogez, "agitation"]
came" (3:25-26). It seems that the peculiar form of suffering of which
Job complains, the reason that he wishes never to have been born, is
anxiety, dread —in Heidegger's term, angst. All his life he has been
wracked by premonitions, even in times of apparent prosperity.15 His
worst apprehensions are realized in the rogez, the trouble that finally
comes upon him.
It is this nightmare condition of consummated anxiety that the mid-
rash applies to Jacob, as it makes him cry Job's cry. It is as though all
Jacob's constant sufferings—with Laban, Esau, Dinah—have  
engendered in him a radical disease, as he senses the catastrophe potential in
every moment. The rogez of Joseph—the trouble that leaps upon him at
that time in his life when he had hoped to find some peace, is a savage
affirmation of all his life's intimations of vertigo. The peace that Job
associates with death is precisely the peace that Jacob desires: a release
from the deep troubling of his spirit that time and again sweeps over him.
The problem of Being
The extraordinary perspective of the midrash yields a view of this disease
as essential to human experience. The wicked may gain quick release
from angst; the righteous, however, are asked to suffer it to the end, if they
are to gain any reward at all. To seek peace prematurely is to beg off from
reality. Job speaks elsewhere of the "peace" of the wicked, who die in
immaculate tranquillity (21:23); that very peace is an index to a profound
disqualification for the human project. "It would have been better [more
comfortable, more restful] for man never to have been created," say the
Sages, in a rare moment of apparent nihilism.16 But through Job's
perspective, in this chapter, this is a realistic nihilism, for comfort, ease,
are signally lacking in the life of a human being, an adam. Or— to reverse
the terms —it is characteristic of a human being to find life  
uncomfortable, filled with angst and unease.
"Man is the only being to whom Being is a problem," says Heidegger.
The midrash applies this notion to a theology of which Jacob-Job  
becomes the paradigm. A fundamental vertigo afflicts him, a sense of being
a stranger in the world. When he tries to "settle in peace," he looses the
vengeful furies of the Joseph story—not because his is a moral offense,
but because it constitutes a wrong understanding of the human condition.

260
VA-YESHEV
Such an artificial peace, a simulation of death in life, can be expressed
in terms of the storytelling model. Jacob seeks to order his experience, to
construct his world, in such a way that the texts of God's promise knit
with his reality, each giving solid being to the other. Such a desire, as we
have seen, may even represent the duty of a human being to seek out the
meaningful structure of text and world.17 And yet this commendable
passion for order becomes, in the metaphoric texture of Jacob's narrative,
a temptation, from which he is savagely barred. Just as he thinks he has
arrived at a cogent version of his own narrative, "trouble comes."
Jtvogez: the narrative disturbed
Rogez, translated here as "trouble" or "agitation," means, of course,
something akin to "anger" — a strange nuance to evoke in speaking of
Jacob's loss — subjectively, his bereavement— of Joseph, But this is a word
specifically used by Joseph in a context where it seems equally enigmatic.
When he sends the brothers home to their father, after he has revealed
his true identity, he instructs them: "Do not be quarrelsome [tirgezu] on
the way" (45:24). Rashi comments: "The plain meaning of the text is that
since they were ashamed [of their crime against Joseph], he was anxious
lest they quarrel on the journey about who had been responsible for
selling him, by slandering him and causing the others to hate him." From
Rashi's reading, one might understand rogez as that irritability of  
conscience that leads to the attempt to shift responsibility. Rogez is thus a
peculiarly human, indeed moral response to the discomfort of shame —a
radical agitation, a disturbance of the narrative one tells oneself. Such
irritability leads to investigating "first causes," almost insignificant knots
in the texture of human relationships.
The brothers experience this undercutting of their own narrative,
when Joseph, as Egyptian viceroy, accuses them of spying, and demands
that they bring their youngest brother in proof of their story. The illogic
of such a demand engenders in them the vertigo of an alternative  
narrative. Suddenly, they see the narrative connections of their lives as very
differently articulated: "They said to one another, 'Alas [aval— lit., but],
we are being punished on account of our brother, because we looked on at
his anguish, yet paid no heed as he pleaded with us. That is why this
distress has come upon us" (45:21).

Re-membering the Dismembered
261
The strangely used word aval— "but" — suggests the vertigo of plot
transformation. The brothers become dizzyingly aware of another  
narrative than the one they have been telling themselves all along. The
uncanny, even savage irrationality of Joseph's charge has forced them out
of the "peace" of their narrative constructions, so that another, perhaps
truer story can emerge.18 Perhaps the unifying motif of the story is, after
all, as the brothers begin to perceive, tzara—grief, trouble. Only now,
feeling the pinch of anguish and outrage as their plot, in the largest sense,
collapses, can they "replay" the scene of Joseph's anguish and hear his
cries.
Similarly, the rogez of Joseph's disappearance comes to Jacob as an
agitating realization of many premonitions: it reminds him conclusively
of the nonsense of his narrative, of his attempts at constructing a coherent
reality. Instead oiyishuv ha-dayat> instead of that sanity of the admirable
projects of consciousness, shaping, plotting experience, there is, finally
and fatally, terufha-da'at, the insanity in which the center will not hold,
and things fall apart.
The extremity of Jacob's condition is indicated in the classic midrashic
comment: "The Presence of God abandons him." Effectively, he is left
with his narrative torn, but with no alternative narrative to replace it. A
coherent narrative gave him a sense of life; without it, notes Rashi
(37:35), he cries that he is doomed to the inferno of fragmentation: " 7
shall go down mourning to She'ol\ This is Gehinnom—xhe inferno—for this
sign was given me by God, that if none of my sons died in my lifetime,
I was assured that I would not see Gehinnom"
A wholeness has been fractured, as Jacob is bereft of the plot of his life.
When he cries out at the sight of the torn coat: taroftorafyosef— "Joseph is
torn in pieces" —the midrash describes a startling verbal connection:
" 'Why do you say, O Jacob, Why declare, O Israel, My way is hid from
the Lord' [Isaiah 40:27]. So said Jacob: 'Till now, while I guarded Laban's
sheep, no wild animal ever attacked them—and now they have set upon
the son of my old age!' "19
Jacob recalls his protest to Laban at the end of his twenty years of
faithful service: "That which was torn by beasts [trefa] I never brought to
you; I myself made good the loss; you exacted it of me, whether snatched
by day or snatched by night" (31:39). In all that time, he claims, there was
no case of a sheep torn by lion or bear (see Rashi). With savage irony,
Jacob notes the violent "rhymings" of fate: Laban's sheep were kept

262
VA-YESHEV
intact from tearing, and his beloved son is torn apart by wild animals!
"My way is hid from the Lord!" He expresses the loss of all meaningful
narrative; he cannot even conceive of a map of his life course, even from
God's perspective, that should make his experience intelligible.
The irony in this midrash is, in fact, taken a significant stage further, in
another provocative reading: Jacob's scrupulous guarding of the sheep
from trefa, from being torn by wild animals, is seen as an offense against
the balance of things: " 'I myself made good the loss' [lit., I would sin
against the lion]. For God had decreed that the lion should tear and eat of
Laban's sheep. 'Snatched by day' — 'I was called a thief by day and by
night.'"20
In protecting the sheep against the depredations of the wild animals,
Jacob made a kind of ecological error. Depending on one's perspective,
one can consider this as a virtue or a vice: Laban's property is kept intact,
by his heroic efforts, but the lion is cheated of his legitimate prey. The
word teref— "torn"—is, in fact, the word for "food," "daily needs," in
relation to wild animals and, by metaphoric extension, even in relation to
human beings.21 There is a passionate, absolute quality to the needs that
Jacob frustrates with all the determination he can command. By day or by
night, in freezing cold or burning heat, he sets himself against trefa,
against that savaging of integrity that God, it seems, has made the law of
the lion's nature. The midrash offers a moment of shocked recognition,
as Jacob, who has invested all his energy in sanity, consciousness,  
wholeness, reels under the backlash effect of teruf.
There is a terrible symmetry in the plot that is reminiscent of The
Bacchae. In Euripides' tragedy, King Pentheus defies and attempts to
suppress the "bacchic forces," the orgiastic, drunken, anarchic energies,
only to be torn in pieces by the ecstatic, dionysiac women, among them
his own mother. Subtly, the midrash suggests a similar motif: Jacob's
passion for wholeness denies the rights of the lion. With the poignant
incommensurateness of tragedy, Jacob's whole world is torn apart, so that
no peace, no coherent narrative seems possible.
"My way is hidden from the Lord" — both Jacob and Job express a
radical sense of absurdity, through this image of the "hidden way." Here,
indeed, is the focus of the Jacob-Job analogy. The midrash, as we have
just seen, puts Isaiah's words into Jacob's mouth, as his profound  
response to the motif of "tornness" in his life. And Job, in chapter 3, which
we have read as his central text on angst, on the basic restlessness, dis-

Re-membering the Dismembered
263
ease, of man in the world, cries at the climax of his lament, "Why does He
give life ... to the man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged
about?" (3:19-22). This text, too, is put into Jacob's mouth (or at least
the final verse of the chapter—"I had no repose") in the midrash we
considered earlier. And here, Jacob-Job's "mal-aise" is clearly defined as
a sense of not-being-seen by God. "My way is hidden," conveys the
experience of a life lived through time but not held in any kind of steady
perspective.
And yet, as the midrashic play on the trefa motif suggests, pure
contingency is not the real problem of the Joseph story. What the
characters have to contend with, rather, is a sense of alilah, of a plot that
transcends and, essentially, ignores the realities of human experience. For
to be in an alilah means to be caught in the purposes of another, whether
for benign or malignant ends. To be alul is to have one's being totally
accounted for, used for its plot value, to be incapable of surprising.22
There is something undignified in such a condition: a significant human
freedom—to tell the tale of one's own life — seems to be overridden.
Joseph and his brothers: bewilderments
of interpretation
The sense of not being able to understand their own story also constitutes
the radical anxiety that Joseph inflicts on his brothers. His technique is a
series of enigmatic questions whose drift is opaque to his victims. To be
interrogated in such a way that one cannot construe the significance of
the interrogator's "plot" is to experience the authentic terror of one
caught in an alilah. Even the benign questions of, for example, a doctor
may induce this special terror, for the doctor has a "narrative" in mind, a
possible diagnosis, in the light of which he examines for symptoms. This
narrative is "about" the patient, but he cannot decipher its meaning.
In Kafka's The Trial, for instance, K. suffers from this anxiety, as he
tries unsuccessfully to decipher the plot, the case that he has to answer.
There are multiple possibilities, which constantly interpose between K.
and any single solution. As in any interpretation of a text, "The scriptures
are unalterable and the comments often enough merely express the
commentator's bewilderment."23 When K. and the priest debate  
interpretation of the story of the doorkeeper before the Law, K. finally

264
VA-YESHEV
experiences fatigue, a sense that he is not qualified for the task of
interpretation:
He was too tired to survey all the conclusions arising from the story,
and the trains of thought into which it was leading him were unfamiliar,
dealing with impalpabilities better suited to a theme for discussion
among Court officials than for him. The simple story had lost its clear
oudine, he wanted to put it out of his mind.24
Joseph's brothers suffer a similar vertigo, as they lose control of their
own "simple story," under Joseph's questioning. Finally, Judah, as their
spokesman, expresses their radical outrage: "My lord asked his servants,
'Have you a father or another brother?'" (45:19). Judah begins his own
narrative of the enigmatic relations between the ruler and his brothers:
"You asked ... we said . . . you said ... we said . . . you said. ..." On
the surface, Judah is simply focusing the narrative on the issue of  
Benjamin, whose loss will send his father "in evil to the grave," and on his
own responsibility for his brother. But Rashi quotes the midrash to pivot
Judah's speech on the issue of Joseph's interrogation, which Judah  
presents as a kind of terror-tactics: "My lord asked . . . : from the beginning,
you came upon us with a plot [alilah]. Why did you have to ask all those
questions? Were we seeking your daughter in marriage, or were you
seeking our sister in marriage? But nevertheless, 'we said to my  
master . . .' — we hid nothing from you."
In this midrashic account, Judah protests against the libel, the  
malicious narrative in which the ruler has tried to involve them. But even
when it is not malicious, the experience of being in an alilah is painful and
humiliating, for it undermines the central importance of intention in
human life. The midrash calls on the intentionality of matchmaking as a
sardonic example of personal purposes that justify submitting to  
interrogation. Judah protests not against the questioning as such but against
the unnerving sense of being mere figures in the cryptic narrative ends of
a "plotter." His words may sound conciliatory, but, in Rashi's reading,
they breathe angry reproach.25
For Rashi, this aspect of Joseph's treatment of his brothers seems to be
radically significant. He evokes the problem of the alilah on another
occasion, earlier in the story; but on this occasion, it is God whom the
brothers sense as "plotting" their narrative. They find the money they
have paid for corn returned inside their sacks — "Their hearts sank; and,

Re-membering the Dismembered
265
trembling, they turned to one another, saying, 'What is this that God has
done to us?'" (42:28). Rashi comments: "' What is this that God has done to
us?— to bring us to this alilah, for the money was returned only in order
to torment us."
The word alilah is used twice here, the second time in the verbal form
(here translated "to torment"). It implies the humiliation, the sporting
with the victim, by reducing his subject status—in effect, by removing his
capacity to narrate his own experience.26 Clearly, the brothers fear that
false charges will be brought against them: they will be victims of a libel.
But Maharal describes their basic harada— "trembling" — the anxiety
with which they respond to the returned money, as the unnerving effect
of any sudden change in one's perception of reality.27 The integrity of
one's world, one's capacity of describe one's own story, is undermined by
unclassifiable, cryptic events.
Suddenly, the brothers feel that —like the prisoner in Kafka's story,
In the Penal Colony — they are being written on, rather than writing their
own narrative. And, like the wretched prisoner, who will be "written to
death," they squirm with the effort to read what is written. Unlike
Kafka's victim, however, the brothers have no mirror-mechanism in
which to read their sentence. They strive to recategorize their  
perceptions, to find new meanings that will accommodate the invasion of the
uncanny into their lives. But the main verb of the sentence describing
their response is va-yeberdu—which the Targum translates u-tevahu—
they were perplexed, disoriented. The word indicates a shudder, almost of
disgust, at a reality suddenly become unreadable.
This is the authentic alilah experience, as Isaac, for example, knew it,
when Esau stood in front of him, crying betrayal: "Isaac was seized with
very violent trembling [Va-yeherad. . . harada gedola]" (27:33). Rashi
quotes the Targum, which again translates u-tevahu: "an expression
of wonder and horror. The midrash reads, 'He saw Gehinnom—the
inferno—open beneath him.'"
This vertigo of the ground cut away from beneath one's feet is
precisely what the brothers experience —a glimpse of the inferno. For, as
they themselves say, it is not only the ruler, but God, who has precipitated
them beyond their safe mappings of their own reality. The secure  
perspectives they have cultivated fall apart, as they sense multiple possible
"plots" hedging them round. Interrogated by the ruler, trapped in the
details of their answers, they become aware of the many possible connec-

266
VA-YESHEV
tions, the many synapses in the "blooming, buzzing chaos" of their new
experience.
What Joseph has engendered in them is, in effect, not paranoia, but
the condition of radical doubt, in which many possible constructions of
reality seem equally valid. This is no simple act of revenge, but an
invitation to them to live through that fragmentation of a given reality
that has been his own experience. A primal coherence has been shredded
in his life. Before he can be at one with his brothers, it seems, it is essential
that they too know that fragmentation of the alilah awareness.
The brothers' crime: Joseph stripped and flayed
The question that arises at this point is of the actual nature of the
brothers' crime. In the account of the sale of Joseph, there is confusion,
even explicit contradiction: Judah suggests they sell him to the Ishmael-
ites, but the Midianites then come and pull him out of the pit; they sell
him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, and take him down to
Egypt. There follows a mysterious statement that the Midianites sell him
to Potiphar. There are many attempts among the commentators to
resolve the problems of the text; but one effect of the confusion seems to
be to alleviate the brothers' responsibility for the sale —as if to say, not
only do they not kill Joseph, they do not even, it seems, personally sell
him.28 Whatever their intention, God's plot overrides theirs, and their
responsibility for Joseph's fate seems attenuated.
Such a blurring effect on the actual crime of the brothers, however, is
neutralized by the savage statement that they themselves obliquely make
about their act. In thrusting Joseph's coat, torn and bloodied, at Jacob,
and in saying, "Please recognize it; is it your son's tunic or not?" — they in
fact feed him the words with which he interprets its meaning: "He
recognized it, and said, 'My son's tunic! A savage beast devoured him!
Joseph is torn in pieces!'" (37:32-33). TaroftorafYosef— "Joseph is torn
apart": the words, I suggest, express the brothers' deep intent. The
poignancy of the moment lies not in deception, but in the accurate, if
unconscious, decoding of the symbolism of the coat. What the brothers
had wanted to do to Joseph — indeed, what they had done to him—is truly
articulated by their father.
In a sense, the coat is Joseph. His brothers strip it from him as they fall
on him, and before they cast him into the pit. Only later, after Judah has

Re-membering the Dismembered
267
prevailed and Joseph is sold to the traders, do they take the coat, dip it in
the blood of the slaughtered kid, and send it in evidence to their father.
That is, the coat as deception is only an afterthought; originally, in a
primary intuitive act, before any calculating intent has intervened, they
strip Joseph of his coat—of that ketonet ha-passim that, as Rashi  
comments, his father had given him "in excess" of his brothers. They remove
that which is additional, unique about Joseph. Indeed, the word for
"excess" — hosafa—is another form of the root of Joseph's name: they tear
from him that superlative, individual quality that they most envy.
The concept of "stripping" occurs here for the first time in the biblical
text. It is at root a violent idea, with connotations of flaying skins of
animals. In biblical language, it is characteristically used of the  
preparation of an animal as burnt offering: it is flayed (bafsbata), dissected
(nituah), and totally burnt.29 Essentially, the desire of the brothers is the
absolute destruction of Joseph—of that "excessive" quality in Joseph that
is both grace and irritant. The ritual of the burnt offering reenacts,
sublimates a basic savage human instinct—to strip, to dismember, to
"tear apart living structures," as Erich Fromm defines the  
"necrophilous" instinct.
Fromm uses the term "necrophilous" to "denote a character, rather
than as a perverse act in the traditional sense." He adopts the term from
the Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno (from a speech delivered
in response to the nationalistic motto, "Viva la Muerte!" [Long live
death!]), and includes in his description, "the exclusive interest in all that
is purely mechanical."30 In "flaying" Joseph of the "excessive," vital coat
of many colors, the brothers express an intense, almost unbearable
necrophilia: what they are doing to him is, in a radical sense, just what
Jacob later articulates, as he "reads" the coat: tarof toraf Yosef—the
Joseph, "additional" quality of him is flayed, dismembered, so that it
need constitute no threat to them ever again.
For to tear apart living structure is to assert control, to reduce volatile
vital forces to mechanical parts. On a subconscious level, the brothers'
impulse to hafshata and nituah is also an impulse to "abstraction" and
"analysis" —which, indeed, are the modern Hebrew meanings of the
words. In order to analyze a subject, one must, in a sense, kill it. Fromm
discusses the connection between necrophilia and the worship of  
technique (for instance, "music lovers for whom listening to music is only the
pretext for experimenting with the technical qualities of their record

268
VA-YESHEV
players. . . . Listening to music has been transformed for them into
studying the product of high technical performance."31
He relates his terms "necrophilia" and "biophilia" to Freud's concept
of the death instinct and the life instinct (Eros):
It is the effort of Eros to combine organic substance into ever larger
unities, whereas the death instinct tries to separate and to disintegrate
living structure. . . . The biophilous person prefers to construct rather
than to retain. He wants to be more rather than to have more. He is
capable of wondering, and he prefers to see something new rather than
to find confirmation of the old. He loves the adventure of living more
than he does certainty. He sees the whole rather than only the parts,
structures rather than summations.32
Adopting this model, I suggest that Joseph's brothers committed on
Joseph a fully necrophilous act. A fundamental hatred and fear of life is
projected in the torn and bloodied coat that Jacob so responsively  
diagnoses. Like the burnt offering, Joseph is to be consumed utterly:  
dismembered, so that nothing, essentially, remains of him. "The boy is gone,"
says Reuben (37:30): einenu— "he is not."
With extraordinary intuition and knowledge of biblical and midrashic
sources, Thoman Mann conveys just such an image of the brothers'
crime:
They fell upon him as the pack of hungry wolves falls upon the prey;
their blood-blinded lust knew no pause or consideration, it was as
though they would tear him into fourteen pieces at least. Rending,
tearing apart, tearing off—upon that they were bent, to their very
marrow. "Down, down, down!" they panted with one voice; it was the
ketonet they meant, the picture-robe, the veil. It must come off, and that
was not so easy. . . .
Joseph's reaction is that of a man rent apart by the hail-storm of
brutality:
. . . cutting into very little pieces his trust, his whole notion of the
world. ... To him, the most horrible and incredible thing of all was
what happened to the ketonet. That was worse, cruder, even, than all
this howling horror about him. Desperately he tried to protect the
garment and keep the remnants and ruins of it still upon him. Several

Re-membering the Dismembered
269
times he cried out: "My coat! My coat!" and even after he stood naked,
still begged them like a girl to spare it.33
The coat: Joseph dismembered
The symbolism of Joseph's coat is complicated by the goat's blood in
which it is dipped. The characteristic of goat's blood, Rashi says, is that it
is similar to human blood (damo domeh le-dam adam [37:31] — the  
wordplay is highly suggestive, reflecting a basic identity of the human and the
animal, at the level of blood). This is more than a tactical comment on the
shrewdness of the substitution. It is a comment on the substitution itself;
to all intents and purposes, the brothers have shed Joseph's blood; wild
animals have, in effect, dismembered him.
The brothers' involvement in the teruf—xhe dissection—of Joseph is
the central theme of the narrative. "They saw him from afar, and before
he came close to them they conspired to kill him. They said to one
another, 'Here comes that dreamer!'" (37:18-19). The midrash  
comments on the brothers' "distanced" vision of Joseph: "Come, let us set
the dogs on him!"34 They would like to kill him by remote control, as it
were: if pressing a button would wipe him out, that would fulfill their
desire at this point. This oblique form of murder is suggested by the word
va-yitnaklu, with its nuances of craftiness, of detached cunning.  
According to Seforno, they construct an image of Joseph as plotting against
them: they see themselves as endangered by him and try to arrange a
"clean," uninvolved murder.
Only after this plan has failed do they speak of killing him and
throwing him into a pit,
and we can say a savage beast devoured him. . . . But when Reuben
heard it, he tried to save him from their hands. He said, "Let us not take
his life." And Reuben went on, "Shed no blood! Cast him into that pit
out in the wilderness, but do not touch him with your own hands" —
intending to save him from their hands and restore him to his father.
(37:20-22)
Reuben is obsessed by the imagery of hands. Three times, the text
avows his intent—to prevent the horror of hands tearing apart the living
body. "Shed no blood," he pleads, more concerned about the direct
"hands-on" involvement in blood than about Joseph's fate. But the

270
VA-YESHEV
brothers, while formally accepting his plea, lay their hands on Joseph,
"strip" him, "take" him, and "throw" him into the pit (37:23-24)-all
verbs emphasizing the contact of hands with body. What had begun as an
elegant murder plot, to be executed at an aesthetic distance, is played out
in horrifying immediacy: with their own hands, they strip and dismember
him, ironically realizing the images of their cover story ("we can say a
savage beast devoured him").
Then, surprisingly, Judah speaks up, and deplores their act: "What do
we gain by killing our brother and covering up his blood?" (37:26).
Joseph is by now in the pit, so that any direct responsibility for his death
seems to be shuffled off. Moreover, there is no literal "blood" shed at all
at this stage. Rashi deals with Judah's reference to blood, by saying
simply, "Covering up his blood —hiding his death." But a primal horror
of blood dominates Judah's speech, and is joined to the imagery of hands:
"Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, but let our hands not be upon
him. After all, he is our brother, our own flesh" (37:27).
The physical sensation of hands shedding blood haunts Judah, who
persuades his brothers to sell Joseph by his rhetoric of fratricide as quasi-
suicide ("our brother, our own flesh"). But the paradoxical aspect of this
speech is precisely the fact that the brothers have not, in any physical
sense, killed Joseph—there is no blood on their hands. And yet, after
Joseph is definitively removed from the scene —"The boy is gone" —
after all ugliness and terror is expunged, the brothers, as of one accord
(without rhetoric, or special appeals), slaughter a kid, and dip the coat in
its blood —and Jacob "reads" the coat as Joseph, torn by wild animals.
And when, years later, they stand in front of the Egyptian ruler, the
memory of that day returns to them, in a new narrative-connection with
the anguish of the "plot" in which they are trapped: "They said to one
another, 'Alas, we are being punished on account of our brother, because
we looked on at his anguish. . . / Then Reuben spoke up and said to
them, 'Did I not tell you, "Do no wrong to the boy"? But you paid no
heed. Now comes the reckoning for his blood\*" (42:21-22).
Reuben expresses the intuitive feeling of all the brothers that "now
comes the reckoning for his blood." Blood, however, has not been shed;
they themselves, in the depth of their contrition, accuse themselves of no
more than callousness, insensitivity. They "saw" Joseph's anguish, but
did not "listen" to him: that is why anguish has come to them. In this
context, to see and to listen are very different modes of response. The

Re-membering the Dismembered
271
brothers see Joseph's begging face, coldly, in detachment, but they
absorb neither what he is saying, nor what Reuben says in defense of him.
In memory, it seems, the original interaction among the brothers takes
on a new coloring: instead of Reuben successfully saving his brothers
from bloodshed, we are given a scene of violence and callousness, with
Reuben unsuccessfully pleading, "Do no wrong to the boy." The brothers'
act is remembered, after all, as an act of blood, though their failure is
twice described as, simply, "not listening."
Rashi compounds the difficulty of Reuben's reference to blood, by
interpreting the word gam — lit., also his blood is required —as including
Jacob's blood. Clearly, Rashi takes "blood" as a metaphor for "anguish,"
the pain caused by the fear of death. (David speaks of blood, in a similar
mode, when he cries, "Oh, let my blood not fall to the ground, away from
the presence of the Lord!")35 Ramban, too, speaks of Joseph's blood in a
metaphorical sense: "It will be accounted to you, as though you had shed
his blood." Blood is identified here with cruelty, with the indifference
with which the brothers refused to "listen" on that terrible day.
In this sense, they are physically incriminated for the anguish they
have caused, not only to Joseph but to Jacob as well. Their involvement
with blood, according to Rashbam, thus carries on a chain of violence
going back to the massacre of Shechem: Jacob ironically sends Joseph to
the place of his dismemberment, to Shechem, out of anxiety for his sons
in that place of violence (37:13). Their constant references to blood
indicate a primal instinct—the necrophilous instinct—that they  
themselves unconsciously recognize, when they kill the goat and dip Joseph's
coat in its blood. This becomes a symbolic utterance of their guilt, of the
radical meaning of their act.
The original sin?
The brothers' crime remains throughout Jewish history as a kind of
ineradicable original sin, with proliferating effects. Because of it, ten
sages are martyred at the time of the Roman persecution.36 Rambam
refers to this original sin of our forefathers; in constant self-reminder of
this evil, we sacrifice a goat for all communal sin-offerings; the goat that
was substituted for Joseph remains a symbol of hatred and violence in the
consciousness of the whole people.37

indicates two goats.] When they came to slaughter it, it cried out in a
voice that reached the heavens, so that the angels came down to see,
"Joseph lives and I die! Who will tell Jacob?" One of the winds went
and told Jacob what the goat said. But in the end, "His heart went
numb, for he did not believe them" (45:26). So the goat cried out,
"Earth, do not cover up my blood!" And till now, the goat's blood is
damp on the earth, until the Messiah comes, as it is written, "I will
smelt them as one smelts silver" [Zekhariah, 13:9] —the silver for
which they sold Joseph, as it is said, "They sold Joseph for twenty
pieces of silver." (37:28)
This enigmatic midrash treats the sale of Joseph and slaughter of the
goat as the paradigm for all violence from the beginning of human
existence to messianic times. Resonances from Cain's murder ("You shall
be more cursed than the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your
brother's blood from your hand" [4:11]), from Job's sufferings ("Earth,
do not cover my blood" [Job 16:18]) make this midrash a lament for the
pain and injustice of human existence. The goat's insistence on her
pregnancy, on being heard, on her blood's eternal staining of the earth is
an appeal for consciousness of this anguish, for utterance of its  
ineradicable effects. Against oblivion (the earth's sin in Cain's murder of Abel),
against incredulity (Jacob's failure to absorb the wind's report), the
midrash poignantly addresses the reality of evil.
For this blood—though metaphorically displaced from human blood—
comes to represent the human responsibility for suffering—the  
"necrophilous" instinct, wherever it is found. Rashi defines it as including
Jacob's anguish as well; one midrashic source deciphers this mortal
anguish in Jacob's cry, "I will go down mourning to my son in Sheol"
(37:35) —the brothers have "shed their father's blood," in causing him to
set his sights on death.38 And a medieval source conceptualizes the
meaning of such responsibility: "Know and understand that one who
murders or does evil to another is punished not only for that specific
victim but for all who sorrow for him, as it is said, 'Now comes the
reckoning for his blood'" (42:22).39

Re-membering the Dismembered
273
If the emotional repercussions of an act are traced back to the agent,
then bloodshed, dismemberment, the "necrophilous" acts for which the
brothers remain responsible, are not simply a matter of intention, but
constitute the very stuff of the story. They not only intend to strip, dissect
Joseph: they in fact do so. Far beyond their intent, in fact, is the anguish of
teruf, of dismemberment, that they cause in the world. "The blood of the
old man/\* as the midrash has Reuben refer to Jacob, is shed. Something
essential in him dies; and comes alive again, only when Joseph is restored
("the spirit of their father Jacob revived" [45:27]).
Joseph in Egypt: re-membering the self
It is Joseph, of course, who is both the intended and the real victim of
dismemberment. "His notion of the world," as Mann puts it, "is cut into
very little pieces." A certain trust in the correspondence between external
and internal, between face and heart, is torn with the precious coat. Mann
imagines Joseph as desperately trying to hold the "remnants and ruins"
of the coat upon him, as begging the brothers to spare it, even when he is
stripped of it. For it is his excellence, his "additional" quality—the main
victim of his dismemberment.
The story of Joseph in Egypt is a history of his continued, desperate
attempts to re-member himself, to reintegrate the broken pieces of his
identity. He names his elder, Egyptian-born son, Manasseh—"for God
has made me forget completely my hardship and my parental home"
(41:51). He remembers only the pain of his father's home, the last vision,
perhaps, of his brothers' animal faces, tearing him apart—and he is
grateful for oblivion. His son's name continually evokes the paradox of his
dismemberment: he has forgotten, but he knows, he experiences his
oblivion. His is a repression, in the process of becoming conscious.
Earlier, his desire to repress had prevailed over his conscious efforts to
remember:
"And his master saw that the Lord was with him" [39:3]: But in the end, he
forgot, as it is written, "for God has made me forget completely my
hardship and parental home." He would come in whispering, and go
out whispering. Potiphar would tell him to pour him boiling water, and
the water would boil as he poured—or tepid water, and it poured at the
right temperature. Potiphar said, "What! Joseph, are you bringing

274
VA-YESHEV
straw to Ofraim?". . . How long did this last? Till "his master saw that
the Lord was with him."40
In the early days of his captivity in Potiphar's house, Joseph goes about
repeating (whispering) the Torah he learned in his father's house. This is
his strenuous attempt to "re-member" his identity and culture, to keep
"God with him." Since small domestic miracles constantly happen to
him (such as the instantly boiling water), Potiphar assumes that he is
muttering spells —hence, his aphorism about bringing witchcraft to
Egypt. Eventually, it seems, Potiphar does recognize the heroic  
subjectivity of Joseph, as he strives to remember God, Torah, and himself. But
in the end, the midrash begins — as though this end to heroic memorizing
were inevitable—Joseph forgot.
The problems of remembering and forgetting inform the whole  
narrative. The butler, in spite of Joseph's pleas, does not remember to
mention him to Pharaoh: he "did not remember Joseph; he forgot him"
(40:23). But this failure signals a moment when he does, in fact,  
remember certain aspects of Joseph, in a context where such  
reconstructions have become essential to Pharaoh, and, indeed, to the whole
country. His memory is fragmentary, but reassembles a Joseph who is
both nonthreatening and a talented interpreter. (Rashi emphasizes the
"clever fool" motif in his reading of "a Hebrew youth, a servant" [41:12].)
Similarly, Joseph has disappeared down a pit, into the deathly  
oblivion, of which the Talmud says, "If one fell into a pit full of snakes and
scorpions, we bear witness [that he is dead and we allow his wife to
remarry, for he surely died there.]"41 He is lost to memory, his own as well
as his family's conscious memory. Thomas Mann describes his  
dismemberment as "cutting into very little pieces his trust, his whole notion of
the world." A wholeness, an intuitive ordering of experience, is disrupted
forever. Now Joseph must learn to study the faces of others, to piece
together evidence of their inner worlds and of where he stands in the
context of those worlds. He must become sensitive to changing surfaces
and find ways of constructing a world of his own in the kaleidoscope of
exile. Joseph's conscious memory of himself fails, as he works to survive in
pit, prison, and palace.
When his brothers appear before him to buy food in the famine,
"Joseph remembers his dreams" (42:9)—not their cruelty, but the dreams
that had been the catalyst of jealousy and hatred so many years before.

Re-membering the Dismembered
275
What begins for Joseph at this point is a process that Walter Benjamin
calls "involuntary recollection":
The important thing for the remembering author [Proust] is not what
he experienced, but the weaving of his memory, the Penelope work of
recollection. Or should one call it, rather, a Penelope work of  
forgetting? Is not the involuntary recollection, Proust's memoire invobntaire,
much closer to forgetting than what is usually called memory? And is
not this work of spontaneous recollection, in which remembrance is
the woof and forgetting the warp, a counterpart to Penelope's work
rather than its likeness? For here the day unravels what the night has
woven.42
The weaving work of forgetting, that Benjamin so strikingly describes
in this passage, is the experience of Joseph, as he "involuntarily"  
reassembles fragments of his repressed past.43 He involves his brothers, in his
reconstruction of the past, imprisoning Simeon as he was imprisoned,
insisting on Benjamin's being "brought down" to Egypt, as he was
brought down. He weeps three times in the course of a protracted
charade, in which the past returns to him in terror and pity. And as he
experiences the new reweavings from the loom of forgetting, he subjects
his brothers, too, to the radical anxiety of loss and recollection. Like him,
they find themselves disintegrated, whirling in the "blooming, buzzing
chaos" of a reality whose plot is hidden from them.
In the most literal sense, Joseph's accusation that they are spies
constitutes an alilah, a narrative of causalities, linking the fragments of
their experience in a plausible but insane scenario. Moreover, a spy
proposes to assemble a narrative, to weave empirical observations into a
version of the unknown. Le-ragel, "to spy," implies "footwork" — the
restless assembly of evidence for a thesis. Throughout the dialogue,
Joseph insists on his "reading" of their purpose —they are meraglim,
"spies"; he finally agrees to test their claim that they are kenim, "honest,"
by having them bring Benjamin in evidence of the truth of their family
history (42:19-20).
The relation of their family narrative to their claims of innocence is
unclear: if they are sons of the same man, with a younger brother still in
Canaan, does this disqualify them as spies? But the word kenim, "honest,"
supplies an essential clue: the brothers protest that they are "solid
citizens," well grounded in family and society, the circumstances of their
lives conventionally ordered—not meraglim—foot-loose adventurers, mak-

276
VA-YESHEV
ing their fortune by constructing narratives about foreign worlds.44
Joseph proposes to test the organic certainties of their world and, in
effect, to engender in them the tornness, the disorientations of his own
experience. Only so, can they be induced to re-member the repressed
cruelty of the past, to construct, as spies on the unthinkable, a new sense
of family unity.45
For this to happen, Joseph and his brothers must reinterpret the
fragments, must survive the perils of the plot by attempting their own
version of narrative. The intrusion of the uncanny into their lives forces
them to reconstitute themselves. The climax of the process is reached
when Judah tells Joseph a story of pain, empathy, and responsibility, as he
explains why Benjamin cannot be held prisoner in punishment for the
stolen goblet; at this point, Joseph can no longer control his "plot,"
which collapses at Judah's masterful narrative. But the beginning of the
process is an encounter with the uncanny, with strangeness: Va-yit-
naker—"He made himself strange to them" (42:7). They do not  
recognize him;46 Joseph reinforces the strangeness by his arbitrary behavior,
by the return of the money and of the goblet. Out of this uncanniness
and the anxiety it generates comes re-cognition: before identities are
revealed, narratives must be rearticulated.
Judah re-collects the fragments
It is Jacob who narrates a final dreamlike —and largely unconscious —
version of the story, and, particularly, of Judah's role in it. Before his
death, Jacob blesses Judah (in Rashi's narrative, there is a painful, almost
comic moment when, after hearing his elder brothers castigated, Judah
tries to evade his father's attention): "Judah is a lion's whelp; from prey,
my son, have you risen up" (49:9). Rashi reads the word teref, "prey," as a
coded reference to the teref, the "tearing," that had pulled Joseph's life"
apart:
"From prey": my suspicions of you, when Joseph was torn to pieces:
taroftorafYosef. The "wild beast" was Judah, who is compared to a lion.
". . . my son, have you risen up": You have removed yourself [from the
tearing of Joseph] when you said, "What do we gain by killing our
brother?"

Re-membering the Dismembered
111
In an extraordinary midrashic misreading, "my son" is no longer the
vocative form, addressed to Judah, who as lion rises up from his prey, but
refers to Joseph: Judah has managed to transcend the act called the
"tearing of Joseph."
He has done this by his characteristic response oihodaya,  
"acknowledgment." The midrash puns on his name: "You acknowledged your
responsibility [hodeita] in the affair of Tamar—so your brothers will
acknowledge you [yodukha] as king."47
The play on Judah's name (Yehuda—hoda'a) is, in effect, a translation
of the word used of Judah's moment of recognition in the Tamar  
narrative— "Judah recognized [va-yaker] the pledges, and said, 'She is more in
the right than F" (38:26). What Judah recognizes is not simply his
pledge to Tamar—the seal and cord and staff that symbolize his  
authority. He recognizes, in effect, himself. In response to Tamar's weighted
invitation, "Please recognize [baker nci\" he rises above the  
dismemberings of experience. From the loom of forgetting fall his own words to
Jacob, as he presented him with Joseph's torn coat: "Please recognize
[baker na] . . ." (37:32).48 Then, Jacob had been asked to acknowledge
tomness; now, Judah is asked to reassemble that tomness. In the words of
the midrash, Tamar pleads with him, "Please, recognize your Creator,
and do not hide your eyes from me."
J^rom philosophy to poetry
The irony is poignant: Jacob, like Joseph, has had his blood shed, has
been dismembered by the act of his sons. God has departed from him, he
has suffered the dislocated perplexity of dulled consciousness for twenty-
two years. But in the end, he recognizes Judah as "king" of his sons—
because of his power of re-cognition, in relation to Tamar, and in relation
to Joseph. It is Judah who is able to reconstitute the fragments of a
repressed past into a narrative of pity and responsibility; the shards cut by
callousness are recollected in acts of awareness that Tamar simply calls
"recognizing God."
"Jacob sought to settle in peace. . . ." The simplicity of the narrative
Jacob would have liked to tell is shattered by acts of teruf, such as he has
always set himself against. God speaks to him in a strange tongue: "Is it
not enough for the righteous, what is prepared for them in the world to

278
VA-YESHEV
come, that they seek to settle in peace in this world?" There is, it seems, a
painful law that obtains in this world —particularly painful for the  
righteous who would like to retain memory intact, to be loyal to all of life as it
was experienced. This law has to do with the "Penelope work of  
forgetting," with restlessness and brokenness and anxiety, and with the work to
be done on the "few fringes of the tapestry of lived life, as loomed for us
by forgetting."49
Jacob's cognitive and spiritual dilemma is traced by the Ishbitzer, the
nineteenth-century hasidic writer of Mei Ha-Shiloab:
"Jacob was settled in the land of Canaan, in the land of his father's  
sojourning?": in the land of megurei aviv—his father's^r; and in the land of
Canaan, of humility [kana] — and he sought to dwell in peace. This
peace obtains when a person behaves in such a way as to keep far from
all doubt, and guards himself from any evil act. That is the modality of
peace. But in response to Jacob's desire for such peace, God told him
that as long as a human being lives a bodily existence, it is impossible to
behave with extreme wariness and fear and humility. For God wants
human acts, and in this world human beings must act in love, in ways that
are not completely clarified. For this reason, it is said only of the future
human condition: "And Jacob shall again [shav] have calm and quiet
with none to trouble him" (Jeremiah 30:10)—shav means "tranquil,"
as in "He gives my soul tranquillity" (Psalms 23:3).50
In this reading, Jacob's desire for a stable, coherent reading of his own
experience, based on cognitive certainty and moral scrupulousness (which
the Ishbitzer calls "fear" and "humility," respectively), is countered by
God's insistence on the tragic nature of existence in this world. Only in
the future will the yearning for ve-shav Ya'akov, for intellectual and
aesthetic integration, be fully satisfied. In this world, what is most needed
is not fear, which deprives man of initiative beneath the sleepless eyes of
God,51 but love —the capacity to act in a world where absolute clarity is
not obtainable.
In his characteristically dialectical mode, the Ishbitzer suggests an
eternal oscillation between extremes of fear and love, certainty and
courage, in the face of perplexity. A worldview based on fear and humility,
in his paradoxical terms, risks human atrophy; for such fear and humility
grant all power to God. Only a vision in which the plot is unclear, in
which anomalies bewilder serene faith and integrities are torn apart, can
open the possibility of human action. Cognitively, action means the

Re-membering the Dismembered
279
capacity to reintegrate the fragments of experience into new wholes: in
re-membering, to create something unprecedented, a personal language
of self-description.
The Ishbitzer gives us a Jacob who is Everyman, perplexed by  
contingency, searching for philosophical and spiritual calm. In a sense, God
turns Jacob's quest away from philosophy, from the search for certainties,
to the world of poetry. Poetic language is the loving act of the human
being, who seeks to redescribe his reality, in the midst of, and against,
teruf. Richard Rorty, for instance, writes of Freud, that he "sees every
. . . life as an attempt to clothe itself in its own metaphors." He quotes
Lionel Trilling on Freud: "[He] showed us that poetry is indigenous to
the very constitution of the mind; he saw the mind as being, in the greater
part of its tendency, exactly a poetry-making faculty."52
Using this model, one might say that Jacob is precipitated into the
world of poetry, from the moment that the va-yeshev mode falls apart. His
immediate response to anguish is in formal verse: haya raya akhalathu /
tarcftorafYosef— "a savage beast devoured him, Joseph is torn in pieces."
Robert Alter has pointed to the semantic parallelism that scans with three
beats in each hemistich: "Poetry is heightened speech, and the shift to
formal verse suggests an element of self-dramatization in the way Jacob
picks up the hint of his son's supposed death and declaims it metrically
before his familial audience."53
Alter writes of self-dramatization, of the extravagance of Jacob's  
mourning, indicating a kind of posturing response to the bloodied coat. I would
suggest, however, that the formal, heightened quality of Jacob's speech,
the many different expressions of grief, convey a Jacob who has been
thrust out into the maelstrom of contingency, of the bitter  
dismemberments of a world of hafshata and nituah, of flayings and dissections,
abstractions and analysis. The va-yeshev project abruptly fails, and Jacob
responds intuitively with the redundancies of poetry. In gesture and
language, he describes the death that has befallen him. TarcftorafYosef
gathers resonance as the central metaphor for intimate disconnections,
until he finally addresses Judah, in his death-bed poem: Alita mi-teref
beni—"You have risen above teruf "by acts of self-creation." ("You have
recognized your Creator!")
When Jacob is precipitated beyond the certainties of philosophy, he is
compelled —by despair, by fear of extinction—to the project of poetic
self-description. In terms of the Covenant between the Pieces, as read by

280
VA-YESHEV
Rashi and the midrash, the "writ of obligation" now devolves entirely
upon him, since Esau has opted out of a destiny of alienation, slavery and
suffering. He must pay the debt of the "sojourner" in this world, must
endure the fragmentation of self and undertake the project of constant
redescription (the "writ of obligation") that the Ishbitzer calls the project
of love. In Rashi's view, this is the destiny of Jacob, of the righteous, in
general: they are given no choice —the writ must be paid.
Ramban, however, writes of a free choice. As we saw, in his text is
implicit the alternative midrashic perspective54 of a contract, drawn up by
Jacob himself, in which a life of contingency in the Holy Land is set
against the tenacious clarities of settling in the land of possession. Jacob
chooses to live as a stranger, in the Chosen Land, and thus to realize the
meaning in his own life of the Covenant: "Your offspring shall be
strangers in a land not theirs" (15:13). There is a decision here, a
readiness for the "long story" of contingency, vicissitude, fragmentation,
and reintegration. Implicidy, the family chosen to experience on its own
flesh the historical condition of protracted alienation lends its free
consent to its difficult enterprise.
Oerah ys song: poetry and prayer
From dismemberment comes re-membering: for Jacob, Joseph is  
reconstituted first through words —"And they told him, Joseph is alive'"
(45:26). He responds with incredulity, with heart failure ("His heart went
numb, for he did not believe them"). Only after he sees the wagons, the
physical evidence of Joseph's bounty,55 does his spirit come back to life.
That incredulity, that failure of the heartbeat, is the natural response to
language, to yet another possible description of reality. "It is passing
strange," say the brothers in Mann's version of the narrative, "that we
shall have to talk him out of something we once talked him into by means
of the bloodstained garment, so that he clings to it now."56 Having
precipitated Jacob, through language and symbol, into the world of
poetry, shall they now draw him, through language and symbol, back into
the world of philosophy, of certain, clear truth? "How Shall We Tell
Him?" is Mann's chapter heading.
A poignant midrashic tradition has it that Jacob is told of Joseph's
survival and identity, not by the brothers themselves, but by a young girl,
Serah, the daughter of Asher. Mann makes wonderful use of the tradition,

Re-membering the Dismembered
281
having Serah, the poet-musician, sing the words of revelation to Jacob.
She herself has no access to certainty: the brothers say, "Believe it or not,
just sing it and then we will come and prove it. But it would be better if
you believed it, for you would sing the better."57
Through her song, she induces in Jacob a yearning response, as she
plays "teasingly and riddlingly" on her strings. For art has the effect of
performance—Jacob "even clapped his hands benevolently, just like the
audience at a play." But this is its seduction and danger, he chides her:
"Sense and senses lie close together, and song rhymes all too easily with
wrong.
Against his resolution, however, he is moved by the beauty of her
description. When the brothers arrive with carts and asses and the
prosaic voice of truth, he is "half-absent," his "gaze was bewildered."
Serah's poetry and music have engendered a fantasy of loss and  
restoration that he partly deplores, partly fears. The brothers speak judiciously
at first, of "some truth in her harping," and finally of "The truth! . . .
She sang the truth!"59
In Mann's version, a poetry that is both beautiful and true "now for
once is here achieved." Serah's strategy is to have Jacob "think it /  
Beautiful awhile but yet not true, / Lest the cup if suddenly you drink it / Fling
you on your back and lay you low."60 The effect of music, of rhyme is to
induce a dreamlike state, where ideas penetrate, though conscious reason
repudiates them. This gives Jacob breathing space, as it were, to adjust
gradually to the truth of the poem.
The essential elements of Mann's narrative derive from the Midrash
Ha-Gadol and Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer:
[The brothers said:] If we tell him right away, "Joseph is alive!" perhaps
he will have a stroke [lit., his soul will fly away]. What did they do?
They said to Serah, daughter of Asher, "Tell our father Jacob that
Joseph is alive, and he is in Egypt." What did she do? She waited till
he was standing in prayer, and then said in a tone of wonder, "Joseph
is in Egypt / There have been born on his knees / Menasseh and
Ephraim" [three rhyming lines: Yosef be-mitzrayim / Yuldu lo al bir-
kayim / Menasheh ve-Ephrayim]. His heart failed, while he was standing
in prayer. When he finished his prayer, he saw the wagons: immediately
the spirit of Jacob came back to life.61
Mann has clearly mobilized this and the Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer midrash
(which speaks of Serah's playing on an instrument) in his own narrative.

282
VA-YESHEV
The semihypnotic effect of rhyme becomes the basis in Mann's account
for Jacob's discussion of the "falseness" of art.
One important detail of the midrash, however, is ignored in Mann's
version; it is this detail that must inform our reading of the midrash and,
indeed, of the problems of fragmentation and integration in the  
narrative. For Jacob is "standing in prayer" when Serah sings to him. This is
the enigmatic but focal detail, on which our attention is centered. "What
did Serah do?" indicates a forthcoming act of initiative: she does not
simply obey her uncles' command, but adds elements of her own to her
"performance." She "waits" until Jacob is standing in prayer, and she
includes in her rhyming song more than the content dictated by her
uncles: the birth of Joseph's two sons. She sings "in a tone of wonder,"
and Jacob's heart fails, while he is standing in prayer. There is apparently
no problem in continuing his prayer in a state of "heart failure." He
concludes his prayer, sees the wagons, and returns to life.
The act of prayer is the most expressive act of man situated in the
modality of "doubt," unclarity, and contingency, of which the Ishbitzer
writes. Serah bides her time until Jacob assumes his familiar stance: not
"sitting" at peace, ensconced in the spiritual certainties of his desire, but
standing in the characteristic posture of prayer, alert, attentive to all
intimations from within and without. Le-hitpalel, "to pray," is, literally, to
"think about oneself": it is to attempt yet another redescription of the
self, in the presence of God. In a situation of unclarity, such as obtains in
this world, any human act requires great courage, a motive force to
appropriate and transform experience into the making of a world. Prayer
is the quintessential act of this kind; and Serah deliberately sings her
rhyming song to fuse with Jacob's prayer.
The "wonder" with which she sings does not crash through the web of
Jacob's thoughts: it intertwines with them, tentative, almost questioning.
Her song does not include philosophical discussions about truth and
beauty, and therefore it does not generate them in Jacob. It does not
reflect on the nature of poetry: it is a poem, affirming relationship
between fragmentary, rhyming statements. (What has "Egypt" to do
with "knees," or either with "Ephraim"?) Past, present, and future are
contained in three simple lines, as she offers Jacob a possible narrative, a
re-membering of his life.
And Jacob is indeed almost overwhelmed, as the song gently filters
through his consciousness. But still he stands in prayer, working to

Re-membering the Dismembered
283
metabolize Serah's poem into his own poem, even as the dangers of teruf,
of total loss of consciousness, reach their highest pitch. The news of
Joseph's survival does not, as in Mann's version, return Jacob to "The
Truth," from the shadowy teasings and riddlings of music. Rather, it
confirms the tentative, "wondering" nature of reality in this world. It may
be the sight of the prosaic wagons that restores Jacob to life, but "love of
life" — "biophilia" — is restored at the moment that Jacob describes  
himself yet again, under the influence of music. The "quickening art," as
Kant called music, brings life to Jacob, even as he faints from excess of
desire.
Serah has not done as the brothers asked—introduced him gradually
to the new reality, so that his life is not endangered. She has sung the
words of unbearable desire to the music of longing and recollection. And
she has invited Jacob to re-member a world in which despair and hope,
discontinuity and continuity, are interlaced in the poetry of his prayers.

Joseph names his sons
Joseph is released from his Egyptian jail, as the result of an interpretation:
he has released Pharaoh from the perplexity of his double dream, by
translating the imagery of fat and lean cows, of healthy and blasted ears of
284

The Absence of the Imagination
285
corn, into terms of famine and plenty. He is appointed viceroy of Egypt,
after he has advised Pharaoh—going beyond his brief as a mere  
interpreter, a diagnostician of dreams —to appoint a "man of discernment and
wisdom" (41:33) to supervise the collection of corn during the years of
plenty, against the rigors of the forthcoming famine years. Pharaoh
responds to Joseph's suggestion on cue: "There is none so discerning and
wise as you" (41:39). He bestows symbols of power upon Joseph, changes
his name, and marries him into the aristocracy. Joseph immediately sets
about his essential task of gathering food against the famine: "Joseph
collected produce in very large quantity, like the sands of the sea, until he
ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured" (41:49).
It is in this context of spectacular success as provider of food, of life, to
a whole nation, that we read of the birth of Joseph's two sons, "before the
years of famine came. Joseph named the first-born Manasseh, meaning,
'God has made me forget completely my hardship and my parental
home.' And the second he named Ephraim, meaning, 'God has made me
fertile in the land of my affliction'" (41:51-52). The narrative then
resumes telling of the end of the years of plenty and the beginning of the
famine; and of the apparently—and bizarrely—instant starvation that
overtakes the population, so that they have to appeal to Pharaoh—and, at
his behest, to Joseph —for food.
Interrupting the flow of this narrative is the description of the birth
and naming of Joseph's sons, "before the years of famine came." The
timing here is enigmatic: Rashi, quoting the Talmud,1 suggests that the
clause specifying when the children were born —"before the famine
came" —is to make the point that procreation—even marital relations —
is forbidden in time of famine. This seems to reinforce a view of Joseph's
situation of ease, success, and normal human functioning, during these
first years of plenty. In the names he gives his sons, he tenders an account
of his life-drama, as he perceives it at this moment of its course, when his
own fertility mirrors the general prosperity.
Indeed, nowhere does Joseph reveal as nakedly as in these names his
own feeling about the strange vicissitudes of his life. Nowhere does he
comment so openly on its bitterness and its sweetness as in these namings
that encode his sense of God's dealings with him. Before the central
drama of his relations with his brothers gains momentum—before the
famine that will bring them to Egypt—we are given important access to
Joseph's thoughts about his own life.

nasseb: oblivion and survival
Both names are fraught with paradox. Manasseh is named for fbrgetful-
ness. Joseph seems to celebrate the oblivion, not only of his suffering, but
of "all my father's house" (lit.), that God has granted him. The midrashic
tradition indicates that he is referring specifically to his spiritual heritage
(his "Torah learning,,): he names his first-born son for the alienation that
he experiences from his native culture, from "the best that has been
thought and known," as Matthew Arnold defines the nature of culture, in
general.2 It is difficult not to read this naming as celebratory: what
gratitude is Joseph expressing at this moment of his experience?
One suggestion, offered by Ha'amek Davar (41:51), is that Joseph is
acknowledging the mercy in oblivion: he is grateful not to be haunted by
memory. The dangers of obsession with the past are very real for Joseph;
they have the power to cripple him in the essential task he has undertaken.
Not only the evils of the past but its loves, its beauty, and its sweetness —
all have become perilous to one whose business is sheer survival. Joseph's
task, quite simply, is to ensure—in the phrase that is used more than once
to express the overriding value of survival—"that we may live and not
die" (43:8; 47:19). Nostalgia, yearning for the "sweetness and light"3 of
his own culture, might hamper him in his single-minded role as life-
sustainer for many nations.
It is in these terms that Joseph ultimately accounts for God's plot in
sending him down to Egypt, with all the suffering that entailed: he has
been sent, he tells his brothers, le-mihya—for the sake of life (45:5).
Anesthetized to the disabling prods of memory, Joseph acknowledges his
own necessary alienation. The word nashani, indeed—"He has made me
forget" —the root of Manasseh's name, is translated by Rashi to mean,
"to spring out of place" (as in 32:31, where Jacob's sinew shrinks and is
dislocated).4 Implicitly, the word suggests dislocation, the discontinuity
of a leap into a new place, a new mode of being.5 There is a clenching, a
shrinking, a contraction. The rupture of experience that sets Joseph at a
radical distance from his previous life has the virtue of allowing him to
concentrate totally on the imperative of his new condition.
There is, of course, a brutal quality to situations in which sheer
survival overrides all other considerations. Spiritual and cultural values
tend to be assimilated to primary, physical needs. This, according to
Ramban, is the meaning of the strange imagery in Pharaoh's dream: the
fat cows are swallowed by the lean cows, "but when they had consumed
AL

The Absence of the Imagination
287
them, one could not tell that they had consumed them, for they looked
just as bad as before" (41:21).
From this surrealistic image, Joseph understands that he should tell
Pharaoh to collect all the available resources of the good years, for all that
can be accumulated will ensure only sheer survival. No vestige of plenty,
or beauty, will be perceptible in the rigor of the bad years; there will be no
sign of the huge investment of the resources of prosperity. All will be
consumed, assimilated to the needs of mere survival. This, Ramban
asserts, is the meaning of the image of weird "disappearance" in  
Pharaoh's dream: the lean cows do not even bulge, achieve no look of health
or prosperity, as they consume the fat cows. Joseph, therefore, is not
offering gratuitous advice in telling Pharaoh to hoard all the corn in the
years of plenty: he is simply "reading" the dream imagery, releasing its
message.
"The best that has been thought and known" is suddenly, abruptly,
"unknown," under the pressure of a single imperative. The very prospect
of hunger and death can erode all values. In this way, Ha'amek Davar
reads Joseph's words to Pharaoh, "No trace of the abundance will be left
in the land because of the famine thereafter" (41:31). Even in the good years,
there is no enjoyment of plenty, under the shadow of impending hunger.
Cultural values that normally thrive in prosperity are eroded by the
anticipation of brutal times ahead. "Thus conscience does make cowards
of us all," says Hamlet, meditating on the disabling effect of  
consciousness.6 The imagining of famine makes it impossible to live well, even in
the good years. Seforno, indeed, quotes the aphorism of the sages in this
context: "One who has bread in his basket [that is, one whose future life is
assured] is quite different from one who has no bread in his basket."7 In a
reality framed by famine, food does not satisfy. The impending rift
undermines one's basic hold on life.
This grim perspective on ultimate priorities is reinforced by the
narrative at several points. Most obviously, the Egyptian people are ready
to yield everything—property, land, even personal liberty—for the sake
of food (47:19). But, more subtly and, therefore, more devastatingly, it is
Jacob himself who comes to exemplify the power of necessity, the  
subversive effect of the survival imperative on all other values.
Jacob, faced by the command of the mysterious Egyptian viceroy to
send his youngest son, Benjamin, down to Egypt, at first responds with all
the force of his being: "My son must not go down with you!" (42:38).

288
MI-KETZ
(This becomes a formula for unequivocal rejection of an idea, as the
midrash relates: "R. Tarfon would use these words to disparage an
untenable statement.")8 But Judah is not impressed by his father's  
recalcitrance, his passionate refusal to endanger the only surviving son of
Rachel. In a radical sense, indeed, Benjamin is his only surviving son, as
Judah recognizes: "Your servant my father said to us, 'As you know, my
wife bore me two sons'" (44:27). The heart of the matter, as Jacob
articulates it in time of stress, is that he had only one wife, only two sons.
Yet confronting his father's absolute refusal to relinquish Benjamin,
Judah pragmatically predicts, in the words of the midrash, "Just wait till
the bread is gone from the house!" (Rashi, 43:2).
And, indeed, when the provisions are exhausted, Jacob's principled
passion crumbles in the face of the bare cupboard and Judah's succinct
argument: "Let us live and not die" (43:8). Sure death faces the family if
Benjamin is not sent to Egypt, notes Rashi, while disaster to Benjamin, of
which Jacob has such complex foreboding, is only a possibility.  
Rationally, the prospect of certain death must argue louder than possible loss,
even of that which is most valuable, which makes life worth living. So
Jacob, in the persona of paterfamilias, with a due sense of posterity and
destiny ("their father Israel" [43:11]) yields to necessity.
It is this confrontation between certainty and possibility that Joseph
traces in naming Manasseh. A certain mercy of oblivion has allowed
Joseph to turn his back on the world of loves and values and possibilities,
to turn his face unequivocally toward the single necessity of the moment.
But by naming his son for that oblivion, he expresses his ambivalence.9
There is regret in the ironic celebration of forgetfulness, in the imagining
of dislocation. Possibly, there is even hope, a bracketing of present reality
in the flow of time. The question of physical and cultural survival, with
their implicit tensions, engages Joseph to the depths of his being. He
names Manasseh for that tension.
raim: life-giving and life-preserving
Ephraim, his second son, is also named out of Joseph's passionate  
concern with survival: "God has made me fertile in the land of my affliction."
The paradoxical thrust is palpable: fruitfulness and affliction are  
inseparable in Joseph's life. The irony of this association is compounded by the
fact that fruitfulness is seen, in the midrashic tradition, as an essential
EPb

The Absence of the Imagination
289
characteristic of Joseph (Rashi, 49:22), while Egypt is described in the
Covenant between the Pieces as the place where Abraham's descendants
will be "afflicted" (15:13). Joseph, therefore, names his son for the ironic
fulfillment of God's promise. The terror of great darkness (15:12), in
which God had informed Abraham of the fate of his children, comes to
rest on Joseph, with an unexpected twist of sweetness. It is, apparently,
possible to be fruitful, to create life, even in that place, that no-place
("a land not theirs" [15:13]) of affliction.
Joseph is involved on many levels with the question of life-giving— he
is the Feeder, the Sustainer of life for many nations. Essentially, Ramban
suggests, his wisdom consists of the capacity to preserve corn against
rotting (41:33). His is basically a technical expertise: he knows what
additives to mix with the produce to preserve it against lice, worms, and
other destructive insects.
This is the central problem in preserving life: the corruption that rises
spontaneously from the very heart of life. (The belief in the spontaneous
generation of insects was traditionally held till recent times.) How to stop
things rotting is, for Joseph, a much more vital problem than that of
fertility itself. He knows, Rashi comments, a technical secret of  
preservation: he puts a little of the soil in which the produce grew into the
storehouse, and the corn will not rot (41:48). There is a relation,  
chemical or mystical, between life and the soil out of which it grows. Joseph's
intuition about this (which Ramban simply calls hokhmah — "wisdom"),
indicates a general sensitivity to the relations between life and land, to the
need of the fruit for its place of origin, if it is not to rot and die.
In naming Ephraim, therefore, Joseph meditates on the real problems
of life-giving, the hazard of corruption, the tendency of life to breed
death. Desiring fruit for himself, Joseph is aware of a more complex
version of Kafka's description of his own condition: "Without forebears,
without marriage, without heirs, with a fierce longing for forebears,
marriage, and heirs."10 Joseph has all three. But all are problematic for
him; in all, fierce longing is mixed with other feelings.
His forebears are illustrious and forbidding in their effect on his
freedom. The midrash has him reject the advances of Potiphar's wife with
the words, "God is in the habit of choosing among the loved ones of my
father's house for burnt offerings."11 He cannot act as he might desire,
because of his responsibility as child of his forebears. He carries with him
a predilection, an availability to God, almost a genetic passion, that is

290
MI-KETZ
liable to flare up at any moment. His marriage to an Egyptian and his
children by her are similarly fraught with ambivalent feelings. As he
names his children, he meditates on the problems of true "heirship"; he
fiercely longs, not only to procreate—to be fruitful—but to negotiate the
deathly perils of life, the tendency to corruption in an alien soil.
The irony of Ephraim's name is compounded by the invariable  
description of Egypt as a fertile country: Sodom, for example, is described
as well watered, "like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt"
(13:10). The main problem of the famine, the midrash suggests, is not
lack of produce, or even neglect in collecting the produce during the
good years. It is simply, as Rashi (41:55) has the Egyptians complain to
Pharaoh, that "we collected a great deal, but it rotted."
There is a frighteningly immediate character to this rotting: suddenly,
at the very onset of the seven famine years, "there was famine in all the
lands." "The seven years of abundance that the land of Egypt enjoyed
came to an end, and the seven years of famine set in" (41:53—54): playing
on the words va-tikhlena ("they came to an end") and va-tehilena ("they
began"), the midrash speaks of a terrifying transformation, from joy to
sickness—"In the time it took them to sit down at table, there was no
bread to be found."12 Such an instant famine is explained by the notion
that all the corn immediately rotted, at the end of the seven good years.
The terror of corruption, the anxiety that Paul Tillich describes, "of
not being able to preserve one's own being,"13 is Joseph's deep concern.
He has been fruitful; but his fierce longing is to have heirs, in the fullest
sense. Again, the tension between physical and cultural survival is central;
replete with forebears, marriage, and heirs, Joseph must meditate on the
hazards affecting his continued being. At the moment of childbearing,
Joseph is fixed on the paradoxes of rupture and preservation, of staying
alive, giving life, and keeping alive, of forgetting and remembering.
The pit ofoblivion
For the essential fact of his life is that he is a man who was thrown into a
pit, into one of many pits, into more than one pit. The experience of the
pit is the informing image of his life.
Both the pit into which his brothers throw him and the prison in which
Potiphar incarcerates him are called bar. The word usually connotes a
cistern, used to hold water. For this reason, the text makes a special point

The Absence of the Imagination
291
about the bor into which Joseph is thrown by his brothers: "The pit was
empty; there was no water in it" (37:24). Unusually, this bor has no water
in it. But the text then proceeds to use the same word of Joseph's prison:
he calls it a bor, in his outraged description of his undeserved fate: "For in
truth, I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews; nor have I done
anything here that they should have put me in the dungeon (for)" (40:15).
Fate has dealt enigmatically with him: his mysterious kidnapping from
his homeland is paralleled by his equally unjustified incarceration in
Egypt. Clearly, the essential characteristic of a bor in this context—in
Joseph's imagination—has nothing to do with water. It is, in Rashi's
definition, simply a concave space (41:14), a hole, in which Joseph
unexpectedly finds himself, and from which it is impossible to climb out.
This is indeed something of a world apart from the world. In this
space, normal logic and law do not seem to function; it is an absurd,
hollow space in which one can cry out and not be heard (42:21), and in
which one feels cut off from past and future. In A Tale of Two Cities,
Dickens describes the experience of being imprisoned in the Bastille as
that of being "Buried Alive." The full terror of the bor is precisely that of
disappearing, without explanation, down a hole, to be forgotten by the
world.
This implication of the bor is detected by the Talmud, within the text
of the Torah: "They cast him into the pit" (37:24). "Wherever the word
"cast" [hashlakha] is used, it means to a depth of at least twenty cubits":14
that is, to a depth that, in halakhic terms, is beyond eyeview. Joseph,
therefore, becomes invisible when he is thrown into the bor, into both
borot—pit and prison. In the fullest sense, he is forgotten by the world.
The specific case of forgetting that the text narrates is that of the
butler, whom Joseph begged, "But remember me when all is well with
you again, and do me the kindness of bringing me to Pharaoh's mind, so
as to free me from this place" (40:14). Nevertheless, he "did not  
remember Joseph; he forgot him" (40:23).
To be remembered would mean release from live burial. But once
fallen into the pit, Joseph enters a kind of black hole, unimaginable to
those outside. This is a private inferno, in which he cannot imagine
himself into any real relation with his past. When he narrates his history
to the butler, he speaks in the passive, or impersonal form: "I was
kidnapped . . . they put me in the dungeon" (40:15). There is, indeed, an
impersonal quality to his brothers' silent fury, as they strip him and hurl

292
MI-KETZ
him into the pit. In memory, Joseph cannot relate that moment to what
came before. It seems uncaused, a rupture in the fabric of things. He can
only see it as equivalent to his blamelessness when he is caught up in the
vengeful fire of Potiphar's jilted wife. The fibers connecting him with the
world of reason and continuity are cauterized.
To be thrown into a pit is, effectively, to be declared dead in the mind
of others. The Talmud states that the presumption of death is so strong
that the victim's wife may remarry. An overpowering conviction consigns
the ior-victim to death.
Joseph's brothers, in fact, originally plan to kill Joseph first, and then
to "throw him into one of the pits" (37:20). Reuben pleads that they keep
their hands clean of blood—of direct contact with blood —and that they
throw him directly into a pit. Although the text vouches for Reuben that
he intends to save Joseph by this strategy, as far as the brothers are
concerned, throwing him into a pit is equivalent to killing him. More
precisely, it is a way of making him disappear without trace, so that any
story can be fabricated to account for his absence ("we can say, 'A savage
beast devoured him'" [37:20]). Out of the hollow into which Joseph
disappears emerges a narrative, a fiction. On the basis of circumstantial
evidence —the coat realistically daubed with blood — a full-blown theory
of dismemberment and death will become current in the world.
UT
Joseph is not"
The presumption of death is applied in the talmudic case we have just
quoted, when the pit was "full of snakes and scorpions." This detail is just
the circumstance given in Rashi's famous comment on Joseph's pit: " 'The
pit was empty; there was no water in ity [37:24]. If it was empty, is it not
obvious that there was no water in it? There was no water, but there were
snakes and scorpions." Emptiness, in this case, means emptiness of water.
The pit is, in fact, full—of snakes and scorpions. This is, essentially, a
description of emptiness: to be in emptiness, to be assigned to a hole,
discontinuous with past and future, gone from the minds of others, is to
be assailed by all the horrors with which emptiness is pregnant.
Joseph has been projected into such an emptiness. In the next chapter,
Tamar uses all her cunning and courage to fill her internal emptiness —
literally—with child. The Jerusalem Talmud has her pray in fear and
desire: "Master of the Universe, let me not go empty from this house!"15

The Absence of the Imagination
293
Internal emptiness is the specific site of fulfillment, in the biological lives
of women. Tamar speaks of a desire, at once physical and metaphysical, to
be filled by the seed of the house of Jacob. She recognizes the terror of
"going out empty," and will risk the fire to fill herself. Her sense of the
hollow space at her core gives her passion and guile to choose her own
destiny.
Joseph, however, is enveloped in a world of nothingness that threatens
his life with its own spawn, its "snakes and scorpions." In the  
extraordinary expression, repeatedly used in this narrative, Joseph "is not." When
Reuben returns to the pit, hoping to save him, "Behold!—Joseph is not
[ein] in the pit. And he tore his clothes" (37:29). Reuben is affected by a
sense of Joseph's "not-being": there is an absence, a horror of "not-
Joseph" in the pit, that leads him to tear his clothes in desperate  
mourning. He cries to his brothers: "The boy is gone [einenul — lit., is not!]!
Now, what am I to do?" (37:30).
The word ein ("is not") conveys the sudden disappearance, the  
reverberation of absence. Reuben plays poignantly with the word, with its
hollow resonance — einenu va-ani ana ani—("he is not—and I, whither
am I"). Identity, direction, being itself—all are put to question by this
mysterious disappearance. Faced with the empty space of the pit, Reuben
knows that he too is inescapably consigned to a world of hollowness.
"Where shall I flee from father's sorrow?" he asks, in Rashi's reading.
Reuben's einenu expresses the mystery of disappearance. The brothers
speak of Joseph as einenu, when they explain their family situation to
Joseph, in his role of Egyptian viceroy: "The youngest is now with our
father, and one is no more [einenu]" (42:13). The brothers know what has
happened to Joseph until the point when they sold him to the passing
traders (Midianite or Ishmaelite). One might say that they are being
evasive, not wishing, for obvious reasons, to tell the truth about Joseph's
disappearance, but also unwilling to lie and speak of his death. Einenu, in
that case, would be a usefully ambiguous word to describe "lostness."
What gives added poignancy and an uncanny force to the word,
however, is the brothers' real ignorance of Joseph's fate. According to an
important midrashic tradition, indeed, one reason for their journey into
Egypt is to seek their lost brother. When they stand in front of Joseph,
therefore, they evoke his palpable loss, the effect on them of his not-
being.

294
MI-KETZ
The irony goes beyond the obvious dramatic irony of ignorance that
Joseph himself is their interrogator. It lies in the magnetic force that
Joseph's "not-being" has exerted on them: "For the sake of the one who
is not, we have scattered throughout the city to seek him." This is Rashi's
reading of the relation between the whole family— "We your servants
were twelve brothers, sons of a certain man" —and the one lost son.
Joseph's "lostness" has sent his brothers in all directions, entering Egypt
by ten different gates, according to Rashi (42:12). Emptiness, not-being,
loss, demonstrate their power to move, to break up unities, and make the
fragments volatile.
Loosing and finding
The brothers again use the word einenu, when they repeat the dialogue to
their father. And Jacob tellingly accuses them: "You have bereaved me!
Joseph is no more [einenu] and Simeon is no more, and now you would
take away Benjamin!" (42:36). Jacob's starding talk of his sons'  
responsibility for bereaving him of Joseph and Simeon, and the fact that he
perceives their fates as symmetrical — both are "no more" [einenu] — leads
Rashi to comment: "Anyone whose sons are lost is called 'bereaved.'"
Perhaps similarly to the relation in English between the words  
"bereaved," and "bereft," there is a play of concepts covered by the words
shakul ("bereaved/bereft"), avud ("lost"), and einenu ("he is not"). Each
term can mean, unequivocally, "dead" —as in "bereaved." But each can
also mean an absence, a distance, shimmering with perplexities and
possibilities.
Rashi justifies the use of the word shakul (usually signifying  
bereavement of one's children) in a case where the child is simply avud— "lost."
The range of this latter word can be sensed in its usage in biblical and
prophetic texts. When the Israelite would bring his first fruits to the
Temple, for example, he would make a declaration, tracing his personal
history back to the time of Jacob: "An Aramean destroyed [wed] my
father" (Deuteronomy 26:5). This is read as a reference to Laban, who
represents the experience of exile for Jacob.16 Oved, therefore, can mean
to destroy by destructuring one's relation to one's proper place.
To be lost, in this sense, is to lose that ease in which outer and inner
worlds meet: "There is no sense of ease like the ease we felt in those
scenes where we were born, where objects became dear to us before we

The Absence of the Imagination
295
had known the labor of choice, and where the outer world seemed only an
extension of our personality."17 And to lose someone, a child, is to be left
with the husk, the outer world, with a vacuum at its core —einenu.
When this concept of loss occurs in biblical and prophetic texts, it
often generates a disturbing awareness of ambiguity. Is death, final
destruction, the meaning? Or, on the contrary, is it "loss,"  
"displacement," which carries with it the companion notion of recovery, return?
When Esther says stoically, "If I am to perish [avadti], I shall perish!"
(Esther 4:16), she means, clearly, that she is prepared to risk martyrdom
in her effort to save her people. Or when the sailors on Jonah's ship pray,
"Do not let us perish on account of this man's life" (Jonah 1:14); or when
the king of Nineveh urges prayer, "so that we do not perish" (3:14); or
when God describes the gourd as having "appeared overnight and  
perished overnight" (4:10) — clearly, they all speak of the dread and mystery
of death.
On the other hand, when Isaiah says: "On that day, a great ram's horn
shall be sounded; and the strayed (ha-ovdim) who are in the land of
Assyria and the expelled who are in the land of Egypt shall come and
worship the Lord on the holy mount, in Jerusalem" (27:13); or when
Ezekiel accuses the false shepherds: "You have not brought back the
strayed, or looked for the lost. ... I will look for the lost, and I will bring
back the strayed" (34:4,16) — they are describing loss, exile, as a situation
that demands restoration; the false shepherds have reneged on their duty,
if they do not seek the lost sheep.
In these texts, it is of the very nature and meaning of the lost being, the
aveda, that it is to be sought. If the Psalmist compares himself to a "lost
[wed] sheep," there follows naturally an appeal to the shepherd to seek
him out: "I have strayed like a lost sheep; search for Your servant, for I
have not forgotten Your commandments" (Psalms 119:176). This appeal
is based on the claim that the lost one has not entirely lost all connection
with home. The Psalmist still "remembers" God's commandments: they
are not "lost" to him, as Ibn Ezra puts it. Here, the danger of being lost is
focused in the problem of forgetting. And the real drama, the dialectical
tension of "lostness," lies in the consciousness of the lost one, in the
vestiges of memory that appeal for reintegration.
In these texts, the meanings of avad seem clearly distributed. But how
is one to read "Va-avadtem [You shall perish / be lost] soon from the
good land that the Lord is assigning to you" (Deuteronomy 11:17)? The

296
MI-KETZ
Sifrei reads it as referring to exile.18 But a similar text—"Va-avadtem
among the nations" (Leviticus 26:38) —becomes the subject of real  
controversy among the Sages. R. Akiva takes it as meaning absolute  
destruction: "It refers to the Ten Tribes who were exiled for ever";19 "the ten
tribes were exiled from their place to distant lands and are not destined to
return."20 Others say, "Ovdan means simply exile";21 "the ten tribes are
destined to return. . . . Just as the day darkens and lightens, so the ten
tribes who have gone into darkness are destined to emerge into light."22
Here, two views of time —linear and cyclical—oppose one another. If
va-avadtem means final destruction, this is congruous with a view of time
as irreversible—"One never crosses the same river twice" (Heraclitus). If,
however, it means exile, diffusion, loss, this is congruous with a cyclical
view of time and a dialectical view of history: the darkness is a phase in a
returning cycle; the exile moves both away from home and toward it.
But the question of reading remains unresolved: the concept of "loss"
invites radically different responses, on every level of gravity. There is a
perspective from which even the most trivial loss (of household objects,
the memory of a name, a number) can induce the panic reaction of final,
irrevocable disappearance. And there is a different perspective from
which even the death of a loved child is a temporary, subjective "loss,"
which contains the seeds of recovery. In a sense, such losses generate the
energy for great "findings."
The Talmud, for instance, speaks in these terms of the search for a
wife: "It is the way of a man to go around searching for a wife —like a
person who has suffered a loss."23 Presumably, the loss of Adam's rib is
the primary myth here, but the notion of loss makes the finding a matter
of restoring an imagined part of the self. Knowing one's incompleteness,
narrating the history of an absence, generates the desire to find, to fill the
emptiness.
The same dynamic of losing and finding informs the famous midrash
that tells of the moment of birth as a moment of forgetting.24 The
embryo in the womb knew the whole Torah and forgets it as it emerges
into the world. Implicitly, the whole of life is a process of recovery, of
restoring the loss, of filling the vacancy.
This is the "peculiar possibility of the negative," as Henri Bergson
puts it. "Every human action has its starting point in a dissatisfaction, and
thereby in a feeling of absence."25 Kenneth Burke writes:

The Absence of the Imagination
297
[Bergson] jolted me into realizing that there are no negatives in nature,
where everything simply is what it is. To look for negatives in nature
would be as absurd as though you were to go out hunting for the square
root of minus-one. The negative is a function peculiar to symbol
systems, quite as the square root of minus-one is an implication of a
certain mathematical symbol system. . . . One of the negative's prime
uses . . . involves its role with regard to unfulfilled expectations. If I am
expecting a certain situation and a different situation occurs, I can say
that the expected situation did not occur. But as far as the actual state of
affairs is concerned, some situation positively prevails, and that's that.26
The "actual state of affairs" can be flatly described. The "expected
state of affairs" can generate infinite negative descriptions, expressing
disappointment, surprise, disillusion, hope. Here, language comes into
its own; as Burke rather mischievously puts it, "Language and the  
negative 'invented' man."
Unfulfilled expectations represent one aspect of the experience of loss.
Human life, according to the Talmud in Tractate Niddah, is founded on
this experience and on the profound sense of the negative it engenders.
However, it is essential to the process of recovery that the loser own his
own loss, that he become conscious of an absence.
When, for example, Moses speaks of the people coming to him "to
seek God," this can be understood as a psychotherapeutic encounter in
which the leader helps his followers to "recognize what they have lost."27
There is no finding without that sense of loss. The leader-teacher helps
the seeker to identify the hollowness, the absence, that will move him to a
passion of quest. A primal "forgetting" (the neo-Platonic notion of
anamnesis) leads to a process of approximate reconstructions, of  
"makings and matchings,"28 to which the teacher-tzaddik can hold up  
therapeutic mirrors—but only, as R. Nahman says, if the seeker is genuinely
the loser, if there is no inauthenticity in the search.29 Such a genuine
awareness of loss is the only basis for hope of recovery.
There emerges a notion of the intimately imaginative nature of loss.
To speak of what is not may be an academic linguistic exercise, unless the
loss is passionately appropriated as one's own. It is only a "mind of
winter" that perceives "the nothing that is not there and the nothing
that is."30
Only such a mind, a snowman's mind, could attend to the frozen trees
without adding to them some increment of language, of humanity,

298
MI-KETZ
even if that increment is misery . . . There is no "inert savoir"; to
speak as if there were is already to speak as if. Metaphor begins to
remodel the plain sense as soon as we begin to think about it. If Stevens
is right in saying that the words of the world are the life of the world,
then metaphor runs in the world's blood.31
Yuimited perspectives: despair and hope
"The child is not," "the one is not," "Joseph is not," say Joseph's
brothers and father. What Jacob means may cover a range of possibilities.
At both ends of the range, he speaks explicitly of these possibilities:
Joseph is dead (42:38); or, merely, minimally, "One has gone from me,
and I said: Alas! he was torn by a beast! And I have not seen him since"
(44:28). Jacob recognizes that positive identification of the corpse is
simply the work of human language, a remodeling of that nothingness: "I
said: Alas! he was torn . . ." The only fact is a negative one: "I have not
seen him till now."
Jacob will speak of Joseph as dead, when it suits his rhetorical  
purpose—that is, when he is passionately opposing his sons' intention of
taking Benjamin. But when Judah makes his great speech before the
Egyptian viceroy, he delineates a Jacob who refuses the easy pleasures of
rhetoric, who speaks simply, movingly of his real experience, his real loss:
"The one has gone from me . . . and I have not seen him till now." He
says all that a human being can realistically say about loss: to be bereaved
is to be bereft, the one who has gone can no longer be seen. To be einenu
is to enter a blind spot; "we have suffered a loss," the brothers say to the
viceroy, in the midrashic narrative.32 As a result of this loss, they disperse
throughout the city, in search of Joseph. They are prepared to change
their original position, to break ranks, so as to "catch sight" perhaps of
their elusive brother, to bring him into view.
Einenu, then, is a word that describes mystery, the limits of human
perception. As Jacob uses it, it resounds with a profound cognitive
skepticism. This is reflected in the translation of Targum Jonathan: "and
we do not know what has happened to him" (42:13). Apparently  
unequivocal—what could be more absolute than its declaration of not-being—
einenu is strangely redolent with possibility. It is a frankly subjective
owning of loss.
It can, however, reach a pitch of yearning that kills the loser: "When he
sees that the boy is not [einenu] with us, he will die" (44:30). Judah

The Absence of the Imagination
299
imagines his father seeing Benjamin's absence: "that the boy is not." For
Benjamin, like Joseph, has a tendency to disappear, to become einenu. In
his speech injoseph's unrecognized presence, Judah three times refers to
the impossibility both of going down to Egypt for corn and of returning
to Canaan, if Benjamin einenu itanu—"'\s not with me / us" (44:26, 30,
34). In Benjamin's case, however, the significant word itanu ("with us") is
added each time to the word einenu. It is no longer a matter of sheer
disappearance. Judah acknowledges personal responsibility—on behalf
of his brothers —for Benjamin's continued being. On a profound level,
Judah must make a place for Benjamin, with himself, so that if he is lost,
his "not-being," his lostness, is to be thoroughly owned by Judah and his
brothers.
Einenu has, then, an ambiguous thrust, in the direction of absolute
negation, on the one hand, and of a subjective skepticism, on the other.
The word both cuts off imagination or speculation and encourages them.
Before Joseph, there was a man called Enoch, who "was not": "He
walked with God, and he was not [einenu], because God took him" (5:24).
Rashi explains the force of einenu: "He was a righteous man, but easily
seduced to return to evil ways. So God hastened to remove him from the
world, and killed him before his time. That is why the text describes his
death in such an unusual way: 'and he was not in the world' —to live out
his foil life."
Rashi quotes the midrash to give us a sense of the rupture, the
unfulfilled expectation, evoked by einenu. Suddenly, there is an absence.
But "he is not in the world" suggests, by its qualification, that there is an
elsewhere, where Enoch is. The midrash claims this verse as a proof
against heretics, who would like to set Enoch up as an immortal, that he
did indeed die.33 But, as the commentaries to the midrash point out, there
is a kabbalistic tradition that Enoch did not, in fact, die. Without entering
into the substance of this claim, one can notice the ambiguity with which
the word einenu resonates. It does and does not mean death. All one can
realistically speak of is the surprise, the shock, the speculations, the hope,
that "not-being" evokes.
This complex response to einenu is depicted in the midrashic  
understanding of Jacob's mourning for Joseph: " 'And he refused to be comforted^.
One does not accept comfort for someone who is still alive, even though
one thinks he is dead; for it is in reference to the dead that a decree has

300
MI-KETZ
been issued that he be forgotten from the heart, and not in reference to
the living" (Rashi, 37:35).
Jacob, on some subconscious level, knows that Joseph is alive; while,
consciously, he thinks him dead. That is why he cannot accept comfort
for him. The point is obviously paradoxical: normally, one might imagine
that a mourner who refuses to be comforted is overinvolved in the despair
of death. The midrash shifts the reader's perspective: the willingness to
be comforted becomes a mode of despair at the finality of death —it is a
"decree" that allows the dead to recede from the heart of the living, a
kind of treachery to the loyalty of memory. Conversely, the refusal to be
comforted is a refusal to yield up the dead, to turn one's mind to other
thoughts.34
Jacob has every evidence for his reasonable view ("one thinks" —savar)
that Joseph is dead. Not only the stained coat but a veritable conspiracy of
silence, in which the midrash imagines God Himself to be involved,
ensures that the truth is not revealed to him. Nevertheless, a "glimmer of
inspiration" makes it impossible for him to accept the despair of his own
rational mind:
"A savage beast devoured him": The Holy Spirit glimmered in him,
showing him that Joseph would be attacked by Potiphar's wife [the
"savage beast"!]. Why did God not reveal the truth to him? Because
the brothers had placed a ban and a curse on anyone who would reveal
this truth, and they had included God in their ban! Isaac knew that
Joseph was alive, but he said, "How shall I reveal it, if God Himself
does not want to reveal it?" (Rashi, 37:33)
Rashi delicately balances the question of perception and truth. The
truth is that Joseph is alive; but Jacob does not know this on any conscious
level35 —indeed, God does not want him to know it, in Isaac's words.
Instead, he inhabits a field of perception, in which he "plausibly thinks" —
savar— that Joseph is dead, while experiencing "glimmers" of intuition—
rationally, quite irreconcilable with his conscious opinion—about Po-
tiphar's wife, and while finding it impossible to "give up" on Joseph.
There is, indeed, an active force to the verb, va-yima'en, "he refused."
Something in Jacob stubbornly bars him from oblivion: he will  
remember Joseph, keep him alive-in-absence in his mind. Jacob is conscious of
his limited perspective, as a human being. He is aware that he has a "blind
spot," and allows for it; Joseph has disappeared, but Jacob knows that the

The Absence of the Imagination 301
plausible interpretation of the bloody coat is just that—an  
interpretation—a sevara, in the language of talmudic logic. The totality of the
blank—not even a corpse to fill it—and the totality of the conspiracy of
silence around him evoke glimmerings of intuition. If Joseph "is not"
here, in Jacob's field of perception, perhaps he is elsewhere? If he is lost,
perhaps he is to be sought, to be imagined as continuing, not ended?
In quoting this midrash about comfort and oblivion, Rashi is, I  
suggest, making a rare and audacious statement about the workings of the
conscious mind. Like an aura beyond consciousness, there is an awareness
of truth—Joseph is, in reality, not dead. Jacob has a certain access to this
truth, though Rashi insists that God does not want it revealed to him. In
the tension between the two kinds of knowledge —rational, perspectival
knowledge and the awareness of the limitations of perspective —the
einenu sense grows: a profound skepticism, finally summarized in Judah's
report of his father's view: "The one has gone from me. . . . And I have
not seen him since" (44:28).
Ohever/Sever: the dialectical vision
A kind of twilight zone between despair and hope is evoked by the
expressions of loss, of not-being, in the narrative. Radically ambiguous,
einenu closes and opens avenues of speculation. Just this dialectical  
tension is the subject of a central midrash on the narrative:
"Jacob saw that there were food rations [shever] to be had in Egypt"
(42:1): "Happy is he . . . whose hope [sever] is in the Lord his God"
(Psalms 146:5). "Whatever He tears down cannot be rebuilt" (Job
12:14). When God destroyed the plan of the tribes, it was not rebuilt.
"Whomever He imprisons cannot be set free" —these are the ten
tribes, who traveled to and from Egypt, and did not know that Joseph
was alive. But to Jacob it was revealed that Joseph was alive, as it is
said, "Jacob saw that there was shever in Egypt." "There was shever
[brokenness]" —that is the famine; "there was sever [hope]"—that is
the plenty. "There was shever [brokenness]" — "Joseph was taken down
to Egypt" (39:1); "there wasrciw [hope]" — "Joseph became the ruler"
(42:6). "There was shever [brokenness] — "They shall enslave and afflict
them" (15:13); "there was sever [hope]"—"in the end they shall go free
with great wealth" (15:14).36
On this reading, Jacob "sees" much more than the fact that corn
rations are to be had in Egypt. ("Heard" would be a more appropriate

302
MI-KETZ
verb to describe the arrival of such news in Canaan, as Jacob himself
describes it in the next verse: "I hear that there are rations"). What he
sees distinguishes him from his ten sons, who have no sense that Joseph is
alive. Extraordinarily, the midrash affirms: "to Jacob it was revealed that
Joseph was alive."
The revelation takes the form of a vision of shever— a Janus-headed
concept, suggesting both brokenness and hope. The midrash gives three
examples of Jacob's bifocal vision: the famine and the plenty; Joseph's
kidnapping and his rise to power; God's promise of suffering and slavery
in Egypt, on the one hand, and of triumphant redemption, on the other.
The relation of shever to sever, of brokenness to hope, is not, however,
merely sequential. Jacob does not merely see an end to suffering and a
new phase of prosperity. Indeed, the historical order of the plenty and the
famine does not allow of such an optimistic reading: the midrash in fact
reverses the order to adjust it to the conceptual scheme of brokenness and
hope. What Jacob sees is a dialectical vision of shever /sever. When things
fall apart, the opportunity for sever arises. Before such a crisis, in a
condition of wholeness and security, hope is irrelevant. After it, some
plausible reconstruction of the shards becomes essential.
This is sever, the word for hope (the midrash quotes the verse from
Psalms, "Happy is he . . . whose hope [sever] is in the Lord his God") is
intimately related to the idea of shattering, of crisis. It is also related to
the notion of "thought," of "plausible opinion." Sevara, as we have
noticed, is a plausible interpretation. It is the conventional talmudic
expression for thinking: for speculation, ingenuity in constructing a
pleasing hypothesis. Thinking is an act of trust; there are no guarantees
that one is right in one's interpretation. Savoor is often used, in fact, to
describe a mistaken opinion (as we have just seen, Jacob savar that Joseph
was dead). To think, then, is to respond with a kind of courage to the
evidence, the surfaces of reality. To hope, likewise, is to dare to trust the
more cheerful facets of a shattered condition.
What Jacob sees, then, is the necessary relation between disaster and
hope. He sees the condition of the bar, of emptiness, disappearance, loss,
as generating hopeful hypotheses. The fundamental polarity of disaster
and hope is thus expressed in the single word shever, as the midrash
refracts it. The two concepts are related by an inner dialectic; they are
simultaneous.

The Absence of the Imagination
303
This, the midrash affirms, is what is "revealed" to Jacob. He must act
on the basis of hope, of a vision of life-in-death. He may turn out to be
mistaken; but that is the nature of the shever world, into which Joseph has
disappeared. "Not to have is the beginning of desire."37
l\achel and her children: the battle against non-being
Jacob sees einenu as that condition of elusiveness, of not-being-there, that
is characterized by Joseph and Benjamin, the sons of Rachel. It is a kind of
genetic endowment; for Rachel, too, was a mistress of the einenu mode.
"Give me children," she cried to Jacob, in her extremity, "or else I die!"
(30:1). Literally, the text says: "and if ayin ["nothing"], I die!" Some
commentators read this as the suicidal threat of a pampered wife.38 But
we can read it simply as Rachel confronting ayin, nothingness. If she has
no children to fill her emptiness, Rachel cries, she is dead. This is no
threat: it is an intimate existential description. "One who has no children
is accounted as dead," Rashi comments. There is a psychological and
emotional wasteland consciousness, to which Rachel is singularly sensitive.
Jacob responds with a strange anger to her plea. And Akedat Yitzhak
offers a striking reading of the scene, setting Jacob up as philosophical
opponent to RacheFs despair. The background is the two names that
were given to Eve, to signify her two roles: Eve [Hava—"life-giver"]
signifies her sexual, procreative function, while isha—"woman" —  
signifies her intellectual, spiritual role, parallel to that of man. The first role is
instrumental, which subordinates her to the procreation of life; the
second is autonomous. A woman who cannot bear children still has what
the commentator calls her greatest purpose in living—her moral and
spiritual role, equivalent to a man's.
It is for this reason that Jacob is angry with Rachel: she has invested all
her life energy in the procreative role, has surrendered to ayiny once that
role seems denied to her. "Let not the eunuch say, 'I am a withered
tree.' "39 The pathos of Rachel's cry is understood but rejected. Poignant
as is the sense of life denied in childlessness, the prophet Isaiah maintains
that a vital identity—even a kind of immortality—is awarded to those
people, men or women, eunuch or foreigner, who fulfill their destiny as
moral and spiritual beings.
On this view, Jacob is angered by Rachel's despairing acceptance of
ayin. She sees herself—mistakenly, according to Akedat Yitzhak—as hav-

304
MI-KETZ
ing only one avenue of escape from nothingness. But this is, nevertheless,
Rachel speaking her truth. It is, indeed, the only speech that Rachel
makes in the whole narrative, aside from her naming of Joseph.
In all her beauty, Rachel is the one who is not there. During their
wedding night, Jacob "knew" that Rachel was there, but in the morning,
"Behold! she was Leah!" (29:25). "All night," he accuses Leah, "I called
you 'Rachel!' and you answered!"40 For Jacob, Rachel always represents
an absence, as beauty perhaps always arouses the desire for what cannot
be possessed.
And, suddenly, ba-derekhy on the journey back to the Holy Land, she
dies in childbirth. Rashi reads Rachel's death "on the way," as setting up a
dangerous precedent, creating in her family a kind of genetic sensitivity
to the derekhy to the road between places, that is no place. In the light of
this he understands Jacob's reluctance to let Benjamin travel to Egypt
with his brothers. The whole family is aware of the hazard: if Benjamin
"leaves his father, he will die" (44:22). Rashi comments: "If he leaves his
father, we are anxious that he will die on the derekh [journey], since his
mother died on the derekh" From the beginning, Jacob is most protective
of Benjamin, apparently because of the family history oiasson — the blow
of fate on the journey between places. There is almost an expectation that
the children of Rachel will disappear into nothingness, into the modality
of einenu.41
The central text for a study of Rachel and einenuy however, is the
famous poignant description in Jeremiah 31:15-17:
Thus said the Lord: A cry is heard in Ramah—wailing, bitter  
weeping—Rachel weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted for
her children, who are gone [einenu]. Thus said the Lord: Restrain your
voice from weeping, your eyes from shedding tears; for there is a
reward for your labor—declares the Lord: They shall return from the
enemy's land. And there is hope for your future—declares the Lord:
your children shall return to their country.
Like Jacob, Rachel refuses comfort. It is as though she has been
reconciled to his view of things, to the dialectical view of crisis. She
refuses the comfort that means despair, because her children are einenu—
they have gone out of her line of sight. Radak explains the word: "The ten
tribes have not yet returned, since their exile [unlike the tribes of Judah
and Benjamin], and their place is unknown." Rachel, always sensitive to

The Absence of the Imagination
305
ayin, registers the disappearance of her children42 from her field of
perception: therefore, she will not give up on them. They are lost:
therefore, they will be found. They are dispersed and placeless: therefore,
they will be gathered together. This is the burden of her tears; this is the
"labor" of hope, enacted in her weeping.
The dialectic of shever and sever, of rupture and reintegration, is evoked
in the place of Rachel's burial. On his deathbed, Jacob explains the reason
for burying her ba-derekh, on the way, "no place": "As for me, when I was
returning from Padan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, while I was journeying
in the land of Canaan, when still some distance short of Ephrath; and I
buried her there on the road to Ephrath" (48:7).
Rashi comments on Jacob's emphatic references to her burial "there
on the road":
"And I buried her there": I did not even bring her into Bethlehem, to
bring her into Israel proper. I know you [Joseph] resent this—but know
that it was by the word of God that I buried her there, so that she should
be a help to her children: when Nebuzzaradan sends them into exile
and they pass by on the road there, Rachel will come out over her grave
and weep and beg mercy for them, as it is said, "A voice is heard in
Ramah" [Jeremiah 31:15] — and God will reply, "There is a reward for
your labor, says the Lord, and your children shall return to their
country."
Rachel is buried between fixed places of human concourse, in a no-
man's land, which is the metaphysical space her children will traverse on
their way into exile.43 She meets them, as it were, at the border, in that
exposed place, where they move offinto not-being; she weeps their einenu
into provisional absence.
In mystical sources, Rachel becomes a code word for Kenesset Yisrael,
the principle of cohesion in a dispersed people. As her children scatter,
are broken up, the magnetic force of Rachel's desire, of her battle against
ayin, manifests itself, and generates the dialectical movement of "return
to their borders." Rachel becomes a word for imagination and desire, for
the essential unity of a diffused Israel.44
Joseph and his brothers: the recognition of absence
Like his mother Rachel, Joseph is einenu, and learns to use the energy of
his disappearance to reconstitute his dispersed identity. For Joseph is

306
MI-KETZ
lost—both to his family and to himself. There is a need to recognize that
lostness, to gauge the space he has placed between himself and his
memories. And so he names his sons for discontinuity and survival. He
defines the real dilemma of "Let us live and not die," which is the
problem of both giving life and preserving life, of growing corn and
preserving it against corruption, of forgetting and remembering. And
when his brothers appear before him in the Egyptian court, he enacts the
einenu which is his family's account of him, as a means of realizing more
clearly the contours of his own absence.
"When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them; but he acted like
a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them" (42:7). Joseph sets
himself to act a role of total alienation. Rashi reads va-yitnaker: "He acted
to them like a non-Jew, in his way of speaking— his language was harsh."
He tests his actual alienation, his lostness, by taking it almost to a point
of caricature. Conscious of the perils of assimilation, of forgetting his  
native culture, he acts—more, he speaks—m a style and tone barbaric to a
Jewish ear.
His purpose is hinted in the fact that the root of va-yitnaker ("he acted
like a stranger") is the same as that of va-yakirem ("he recognized them.")
The root—nakar— means "to perceive by making strange" — that is, to
know by breaking up the smooth continuities of things and focusing on
the singularity of the object. In order finally to be known by his brothers
in a way that will heal the rifts of the past, Joseph makes himself strange to
the point of uncanniness. His accusations that they are spies constitute
bizarre probes of their responses, while his inquisitorial persona is so
incomprehensible that his brothers are freed, in a sense, from any
attempt to communicate with him.
He is an enigmatic sovereign presence, his true face unseen,45 set at a
distance from them by the presence of an interpreter. In this way, he can,
for the first time, hear them, as they remember their deafness to Joseph's
cries from the pit:
They said to one another, "Alas, we are being punished on account of
our brother, because we looked on at his anguish, yet would not listen as
he pleaded with us." Then Reuben spoke up and said to them, "Did I
not tell you, 'Do no wrong to the boy'? But you would not listen" They
did not know that Joseph understood [lit., was listening for there was
an interpreter between him and them. (42:21-23)

The Absence of the Imagination
307
This has not, apparently, been a listening family. In a  
quasi-therapeutic situation, Joseph understands (this secondary meaning olshama ["to
hear"] is the primary meaning in this context) and accepts46 his brothers'
appalled memory of their refusal to understand and accept him.  
Acceptance means allowing the other—strange, singular as he is—into one's
heart: the brothers speak not of active cruelty—murder, the sale of
Joseph—but of a negation, a blankness, where acceptance should have
been.
As Joseph hears his brothers recognize what was not in the past, an
overwhelming emotion wells up in him: "He turned away from them and
wept. But he came back to them and spoke to them; and he took Simeon
from among them and had him bound before their eyes" (42:24). He has
to turn away from them to hide his outburst of tears.
Joseph's tears: retrieving absence
This is the first of three occasions on which Joseph weeps, in the course
of his masquerade with his brothers. In fact, Joseph sheds most of the
tears in Genesis; before him, Jacob and Esau wept, on meeting again
after so much hatred and fear (3 3:4). From them Joseph learns to weep—
the irrational collapse of tears, the genuine, unassimilated force of
that flow.47
Each time he weeps, something opens up in him, an unplanned
response, which is at first a mere parenthesis, as he turns away and then
turns back to his tyrannical role. In the course of that "parenthesis," he
knows himself lost and remembered by his brothers. As they speak of
what was not in the past, a new relationship is suggested, woven of regret,
empathy, loss. Listening to them, Joseph begins to be; his real life takes
on imagined luster in their words, in their contrition.
He weeps again, when Benjamin appears in front of him. Again,
spontaneously, anarchically, tears force him away from his brothers: even
more emphatically, the narrative stresses this withdrawal: "Joseph  
hurried out, for he was overcome with feeling toward his brother and was on
the verge of tears; he went into a room and wept there. Then he washed
his face, reappeared, and —now in control of himself—gave the order,
'Serve the meaP" (43:30-31). The effect is of a kind of slow-motion
lingering on the experience of weeping—before, during, and after. This
is time out of time, after which Joseph returns to the routines of his host

308
MI-KETZ
role ("Serve the meal"). Again, a profound, repressed consciousness
breaks through with his tears.
Here, Rashi quotes the midrash to provide a subtext to Joseph's
weeping:
"He was overcome with feeling": Joseph asked Benjamin, "Do you have a
full brother [from your mother]?" He answered, "I had a brother, but I
don't know where he is." Joseph asked him, "Do you have children?"
And he answered, "I have ten children." Joseph asked, "What are their
names?" Benjamin answered, "Bela, Bekher, etc." Joseph then asked,
"What do these names mean?" And Benjamin replied, "They are all
for my brother and the troubles that have befallen him: Bela—because
he was swallowed up among the nations; Bekher—because he was first
born to my mother; . . . Hupim—because he did not see my wedding,
nor did I see his; Ard —because he went down among the pagans."
(43:30).
In this midrashic narrative, Joseph's compassion is stirred, not simply
by nostalgia and love for his true brother Benjamin, but because his own
existence is suddenly fleshed out in absence. Through all the years of
einenUy out of the line of Benjamin's sight, he has continued to be an
object of imagination and regret for his brother. The naming of  
Benjamin's sons responds to the enigma that had inspired the naming of his
own sons; indeed, it is clearly he who takes the initiative in eliciting
information from Benjamin about the meaning of his sons' names —as
though he seeks precisely the mirroring consolation that Benjamin gives
him. For—absent, forgotten, swallowed up—Joseph has lived on in  
Benjamin's mind, as a continuous presence, manifested in the names of his
sons: an elder brother, pleasant, his father's prime student, marrying in
some unknown place, captive, alienated.
It is this fusion of absence and presence, of alienation and empathy,
this understanding of Joseph's "lostness" to himself that Benjamin has
recorded, through the years of separation. In naming his children, he has
registered irremediable loss: for words, names are, in George Steiner's
phrase, an indication of "real absence": "That which endows the word
rose, that arbitrary assemblage of two vowels and two consonants, with its
sole legitimacy and life force is, states Mallarme, ^'absence de toute rose.\ . .
The truth of the word is the absence of the world."48 And yet, as Steiner
himself argues, words, names, constitute a "counterwork!"; they are a

The Absence of the Imagination
309
gesture of human creativity, defiant of the blankness of reality. Joseph's
tears are the sign of a wild hope in brokenness.
Nevertheless, he "controls himself." There is a plot afoot to reveal his
brothers' response to Benjamin under duress. Repressed memories of
their cruelty to him rise to the surface, as their responsibility to Rachel's
other son, Benjamin, is tested. Will they abandon him, as they abandoned
Joseph in the past? This question—of abandonment, of alienation, rather
than of active cruelty—is the essence of Joseph's plot, in its final stage.
When Judah offers himself in place of Benjamin, simply because it is
unbearable to him to witness his father's anguish, if he should return
without him (44:34), Joseph again bursts out in weeping.
This time, however, he cannot restrain himself:
Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he
cried out, "Have everyone withdraw from me!" So there was no one
else about when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. His sobs
were so loud that the Egyptians could hear, and so the news reached
Pharaoh's palace. Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Is my
father still alive?" (45:1-3)
As on previous occasions of weeping, Joseph has time, before his tears
overwhelm him, to make preparations. But this time, he "could no longer
control himself," he cannot hold himself to his scheme. The implication
is that his plot collapses prematurely. If he could, he would have turned
the screw yet again. In empirical terms, his experiment is incomplete.
Before he breaks down, instead of withdrawing, this time he sends
away all onlookers. And the passion of his tears is almost orgiastic. A
whole verse is given to the description of his weeping, as it echoes
through the palace. There is an intensified sense of the mystery and
anarchy of tears. One can only imagine the terror and strangeness of
those moments, for the courtiers beyond the doors, certainly for the
foreigners left alone in his presence. Only after that long hiatus of sheer
release does Joseph speaks to his brothers.
His weeping is an eruption of the pain of his loss, intensified to a point
that compels him to give up the masquerade. It is prompted by Judah's
repeated evocation of his einenuy and of its effect on his family. In a
convoluted narrative —as in a hall of mirrors—Judah speaks of his father,
who quotes himself: " 'And I said, Alas, he was torn by a beast!'" (44:28).
He remembers the rememberings of his father, and he imagines his

310
MI-KETZ
future response, if "he sees that the boy is not with us" (44:31). That is,
Judah experiences his father's experience of ayin\ and he cannot bear it.
("Let me not see . . . when he sees that the boy is ayin") At this point,
Joseph, overwhelmed by the reality of his own absence, weeps for the
third time and reveals himself.
By "making himself strange," by using an interpreter, by  
"disappearing" for his brothers, Joseph has gained access to his lost self. His
brothers, equally, have recovered a vital sense of pain at their loss. But
when he reveals himself, saying simply—inarticulately— "I am Joseph. Is
my father still alive?" they are dumbfounded: "They could not answer
him, so dumbfounded were they on account of him" (45:3). Their single
most powerful emotion is of shame, says Rashi. But then, they never could
speak to him, respond to his greeting ("They could not speak a friendly
word to him" [37:4]).
The therapeutic narrative
If Joseph cannot find the right words at this point, then all is lost; the
story has returned full circle to alienation, bafflement, conflict. But
Joseph has found himself, a process of confirmation49 has come to a head.
And he succeeds in finding the nexus between their different realities:
going beyond "I am Joseph," he talks of his connection to them—"I am
your brother Joseph" (45:4) —and narrates their joint story:
Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come forward to me." And when
they came forward, he said, "I am your brother Joseph, he whom you
sold into Egypt. Now, do not be distressed or reproach yourselves
because you sold me hither; it was to save life that God sent me ahead of
you. . . . God has sent me ahead of you to ensure your survival on
earth, and to save your lives in an extraordinary deliverance. So, it was
not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to
Pharaoh, lord of all his household, and ruler over the whole land of
Egypt." (45:4, 5, 7, 8)
Joseph finds himself in relation to his brothers: his story is balanced on
the axis of "I . . . you . . ." and "You . . . me. . . ." It is an honest, but
discriminating account of what they did and did not do to him, of the
limits of their responsibility for his disappearance: "You sold me hither"
(45:5); but "it was not you who sent me here" (45:8). The nexus between

The Absence of the Imagination

their realities is God, who has choreographed their relationships, their
absences and losses, in order to "save life." He is the One who "sent"
Joseph to Egypt. The word is used three times, to express God's  
purposeful perception. From the human perspective, Joseph was einenu, he had
ceased to be in the line of sight. From God's perspective, he had been just
where he was meant to be, swallowed up, giving and saving life.
This is Joseph's therapeutic narrative, full of expressions of  
relationship, unblinking of the basic facts of the distance between "you" and
"me," but allowing God to take up the slack of that distance. Out of the
brokenness has come a rethinking of the past, a redeeming of the past, a
hope for wholeness in the house of Jacob.
Joseph's tears, like Rachel's, confirm the value of the einenu. "Is not
value this lack, this hole, which I hollow out before me and which I fill by
acts . . . ?"50 Such tears, as a response to the bor> are perhaps those of
which the Psalmist sings: "Though he goes along weeping, carrying the
seed bag, he shall come back with songs of joy, carrying his sheaves"
(Psalms 126:6). Andre Neher writes of these tears:
What is to weep? To weep is to sow. What is to laugh? To laugh is to
reap. Look at this man weeping as he goes. Why is he weeping?
Because he is bearing in his arms the burden of the grain he is about to
sow. And now, see him coming back in joy. Why is he laughing?
Because he bears in his arms the sheaves of the harvest. Laughter is the
tangible harvest, plenitude. Tears are sowing; they are effort, risk, the
seed exposed to drought and to rot, the ear of corn threatened by hail
and by storms. Laughter is words, tears are silence. ... It is not the
harvest that is important; what is important is the sowing, the risk, the
tears. Hope is not in laughter and plenitude. Hope is in tears, in the risk
and in its silence.51
The pit: hollawness and birth
This sense of hope in tears informs the midrashic narrative at important
points. There are biblical characters who are singularly sensitive to the
ayin> to the hollowness of the pit. Sarah, for instance, who is the subject of
Isaiah's prophetic vision: "Listen to me, you who pursue justice, you who
seek the Lord: Look to the rock you were hewn from, to the quarry
[makevet] you were dug from. Look back to Abraham your father and to
Sarah who brought you forth" (Isaiah 51:1-2).

312
MI-KETZ
In Rashi's reading, the makevet is not a quarry, not a hole, but the
hammer that hollowed out the hole. This is Sarah: not a biological cavity,
generating a people, but a woman whose painful vision "decompressed"
the plenitude of things,52 who gave birth to a nation by "inventing" and
confronting emptiness and vertigo. ("Sarah, who brought you forth"—
teholelkhem—rekrs both to birth and to the hollowness from which the
birth emerges.) All creation emerges from such emptiness. Sarah dies of
it, endowing her children with the will to fill hollowness.53
Adam was first, however. At the beginning of the second account of the
Creation process, the narrative tells of the world before man: "When the
Lord God made earth and heaven—when no shrub of the field was yet on
earth and no grasses of the field had yet sprouted, because the Lord God
had not sent rain upon the earth and there was no man to till the soil"
(2:5). Rashi comments:
There was no vegetation on the earth when creation was completed on
the sixth day, before man was created. Even though God had  
commanded, "Let the earth sprout vegetation," on the third day, it had not
emerged, but remained just at the rim of the soil, until the sixth day.
Why? Because God had not sent rain. Why not? Because "there was no
man" [adam ayin] to till the soil, and so there was no one to realize the
goodness of the rains. But when man arrived and realized that they are
a necessity for the world, he prayed for them, and they fell, and the trees
and vegetation grew.
Vegetation cannot grow, life cannot flourish, unless there is a human
being who can recognize their absence, his need. Such a man can pray,
can express his sense of ayin, his hope and desire. One might mistranslate
adam ayin as "Man is ayin") man is the source of that consciousness ofayin
that leads to all value.
In considering the relations of shever and sever, brokenness and hope,
as a theme with many manifestations in midrashic thought, we return to
Joseph as the Mzster-Mashbir, the one who in the very flesh—in no
merely metaphoric sense—descended into a pit. The midrash recognizes
the seminal importance of that experience. At the end of the narrative,
when Joseph returns to Canaan to bury his father, he passes the pit,
where the story began: "He went and looked into that pit."54 "His
brothers saw that Joseph went to make a blessing over that pit where they
had thrown him. He made a blessing over it, as one should do over any

The Absence of the Imagination
313
place where a miracle happened to one: 'Blessed be God who did a
miracle for me in this place.' "55
Joseph stares into the pit and blesses God (literally called ha-makom—
"the Place"), who miraculously transformed this nonplace into a source
of life. "How many wonders has God done for me, in saving me from this
pit!"56 The midrash seems to suggest that the pit and Joseph's salvation
from it is not an isolated incident but the matter of his whole life. "I am
rebegot / Of Absence, Darknesse, Death, things which are not."57 He
first came to know himself in this pit; his rebegetting has been a history of
many wonders, as he appropriated and interpreted its emptiness.

VA-YIGGASH W
The Pit and the Rope
The stolen goblet: four sentences
Perhaps the most dramatic break between Parshiot of the Torah is the
one that precedes Judah's great speech to Joseph, pleading for Benjamin's
liberty. The tension that fuses the scene is strangely broken before the
words va-yiggash eilav yehudah — "Then Judah went up to him and said,
'Please, my lord . . .'" (44:18). For the narrative is clearly one seamless
unit—the discovery of Joseph's goblet "planted" in Benjamin's sack, the
brothers returned to the palace in astonished silence, Joseph's reproach,
and Judah's response, which directly precipitates Joseph's revelation of
his true identity. And yet in uncanny counterpoint to that seamlessness,
that thrust of dramatic intention toward the denouement of the plot, a
different structure imposes itself, with an ending and a new beginning, in
the very midst of the dialogue between Joseph and Judah.
A closer look at this structure will lead us to focus on an apparently
simple question: what, according to the different voices in the drama, is to
happen to the brothers, if the goblet is indeed found with them?1 The
terms of punishment change several times, and in suggestive ways, in the
course of a few lines.
At first, when the brothers are accused by Joseph's servant, they
answer in innocent outrage: "Whichever of your servants it is found with
shall die; the rest of us, moreover, shall become slaves to my lord" (44:9).
They have no knowledge of any such theft, and can speak with utter
innocence of the goblet's being found in anyone's possession, and of the
death penalty for the guilty one. Implicitly, however, they distance  
themselves as a group from such a hypothetical—though at this point  
inconceivable — offense: if there were to be such a finding, then they assert their
difference from the criminal—they will be slaves, while he will die.
314

The Pit and the Rape
315
The servant replies, "Although what you are proposing is right, only
the one with whom it is found shall be my slave; but the rest of you shall
go free" (44:10). He changes the terms of their punishment, while
strangely asserting that he agrees with their offer. Essentially, he is
addressing their sense of distance, of noninvolvement with the crime: he
agrees that only the guilty shall be punished, though he reduces the
severity of the punishment from the death penalty to slavery, and  
dismisses their rhetorical offer to remain as slaves, despite their innocence.
When the goblet is discovered in Benjamin's sack, all the brothers tear
their clothes, in sign of mourning, and return in silence to the palace.
There, Judah responds to Joseph's reproach with its mysterious emphasis
on a kind of clairvoyance: "Do you not know that a man like me practices
divination?" (44:15). "What can we say to my lord? How can we plead,
how can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered the crime of your
servants. Here we are, then, slaves of my lord, the rest of us as much as he
in whose possession the goblet was found" (44:16).
Judah's speechlessness is poignant but enigmatic: his primary  
response is a gesture of confession, of guilt, that allows of no defense.
"What can we say?" seems, on the face of it, a defeated response. He
cannot justify himself, God has indeed "found" the sin of all of them: the
"finding" of the goblet is an objective correlative for another kind of
coming to roost, another kind of horrifying reality suddenly impressed
on the vagueness, the malleability of memory. In very concrete imagery,
Rashi quotes the midrash to convey this sense of the sudden pressure of
reality: "The creditor has found an occasion to exact payment for his bill
of debt."
The debt, the paper on which it is recorded—these can remain
abstractions, legal fictions, until the moment when the debtor exacts
payment: in place of paper and ink, he demands hard coin, the very image
for a reality that cannot be gainsaid. So what is there to say in the face of
such a demand for payment? Words fail Judah: he speaks of it three times,
before launching into his great speech. Ironically, the inarticulate  
shudder of an inescapable guilt generates the speech that will transform the
whole context of that guilt.
First, however, there is another transaction between Judah and Joseph
about the exact terms of payment. In his inchoate despair, Judah offers
himself and all his brothers as slaves to Joseph. This seems inexplicable:
he extends the punishment that the servant had declared, including all the

316
VA-YIGGASH
brothers in Benjamin's fate, without, at this stage, any benefit to  
Benjamin. Joseph replies in righteous horror, "Far be it from me to act thus!
Only he in whose possession the goblet was found shall be my slave; the
rest of you go back in peace to your father" (44:17).
Joseph repeats, in effect, his servant's just sentence; he accepts that the
brothers are not accomplices in the crime and that only the guilty should
be punished; the innocent brothers should return "in peace" to their
father. The force of Joseph's reply ("Far be it from me!") expresses his
image of himself as a rational, just ruler: in a civilized society, this is
obviously the right sentence. It reflects the thrust of Abraham's  
argument with God over Sodom, for example: "Will you sweep away the
innocent along with the guilty?. . . . Far be it from You! Shall not the
Judge of all the earth deal justly?" (18:23, 25). The very nub of justice,
human or divine, is this distinction between innocent and guilty.
Yet Joseph's lightness throws into relief Judah's strange offer of
slavery for all, with its implication of shared guilt. In a paroxysm of
recognition, Judah mutely acknowledges that other guilt, the bloodshed,
the flaying, displaced onto a goat.2 He is in no debating mood: all
distinctions are blurred between the technical, apparent guilt of  
Benjamin and the profound residue of a crime committed by the brothers a
generation before.
But when Joseph has declared his just sentence, the narrative of the
Parsha comes to an end. It is as though a certain course of logic has been
brought to its legitimate conclusion. Judah has refused the opportunity
to plead for a lighter sentence for Benjamin: in the despair of guilt, he
has simply thrown in his lot with Benjamin. This apparent madness
is rebuked by Joseph's sanity, his rational discrimination. A balance
is struck, and the Parsha ends with characters and reader contemplating
that balance. Even the expression "Go back in peace" lends a sense of
closure to Joseph's sentence.
"Then Judah went up to him." The effect is of an almost gratuitous
movement on the part of Judah, of an equally gratuitous burst of  
eloquence from the man who has just proclaimed his wordlessness.3 Judah
launches into one of the longest speeches in the Torah. What he asks for,
in essence, is that he be accepted in place of Benjamin; he alone will stay
as a slave, while all his brothers go free. He entirely ignores the fact that
he has just offered the whole family as slaves, in spite of their proclaimed
innocence. Responding to Joseph's essential distinction between guilty

The Pit and the Rope
317
and innocent, he moves from a position in which the innocent will be
punished along with the guilty to one in which only the innocent will be
punished, while the guilty one goes free.
On the face of it, this is an unconscionable position: Judah makes no
attempt to plead Benjamin's innocence, nor does he adduce new data to
change Joseph's judgment of the situation. He simply retells the story of
the brothers' relations with the enigmatic Egyptian viceroy, retells it with
great pathos, particularly in dealing with their unseen father, whose pain
in losing one son of Rachel will now be compounded by losing the other.
It is purely on this basis —of the pathos of the bereaved father—that
Judah pleads for an exchange of victims: he will stand in for the precious
Benjamin. The aim of his speech, therefore, is to influence the viceroy—
who has shown himself to be arbitrary and unpredictable in his mood
swings—by means of rhetoric, by emotional word-painting, to change a
just verdict into one inspired by compassion for a Jacob who becomes a
purely literary figure — the creature of Judah's words, the almost classical
type of bereaved fatherhood.
Many commentators have noted that Judah effectively brings no new
data in his long speech. What justifies this long recounting of the
narrative is what Ramban calls the plea for grace, the attempt to arouse
compassion by words describing suffering: the brothers, their father,
Judah himself— all are victims of fate, circumstance, the imperatives of
survival. The need for food, Joseph's stern questionings, Judah's pledge
to his father to bring Benjamin back alive — all have conspired to place the
family in an impossible situation. What Judah asks is that Joseph tinker
with the scales of justice, so that the intimate equilibrium of the family
may not be totally disrupted.
The purely emotional nature of Judah's speech, with its—in judicial
terms—outrageous plea, leads directly to Joseph's unmasking. This
speech presents the last of four different sentences for the theft of the
goblet: the death penalty for the guilty, combined with slavery for the
innocent brothers; the rational sentence of slavery for the guilty one, with
freedom for the innocent; slavery for all the brothers; and an exchange of
guilty and innocent victims. The point of these transactions seems rather
elusive.
We can notice, however, that Benjamin is at the crux of the problem.
Before the brothers know that he is the butt of the investigation, they
affirm the judicial distance between the fate of the guilty one and the

318
VA-YIGGASH
innocence of the rest. Once Benjamin has been incriminated, however,
Judah, representing his brothers, refuses to accept any distinction  
between Benjamin's fate and theirs—even if this means, absurdly, that they
will all stay together as slaves. Joseph and his servant propose a rational
sentence, based on the essential distinction between guilty and innocent.
But Judah —after the silent contemplation of the journey back to the
palace—pleads for a blurring of this distinction: Benjamin must return
with his brothers, the guilty with the innocent, while Judah,  
representative of the innocent, remains in Benjamin's place.
The involvement of Benjamin with his brothers is thus the main force
at work in these transactions. And the break in the narrative before
Judah's great speech draws attention to the outrageous, the irrational
nature of Judah's plea. It is as though Joseph's judiciousness has given
him courage for the leap into a quite different field of discourse.
judah's speech: plea or menace?
Va-yiggash eilavyehuda—"ThenJudah went up to him": traditional  
commentaries, midrashic narratives, and hasidic meditations have all paid
extraordinary attention to the drama of this confrontation between Judah
and Joseph. Particularly in midrashic readings, Judah's "coming close" to
Joseph resonates with a challenge, a tension that continues throughout
history, until messianic times. The two brothers become  
quasi-allegorical figures, representing opposing principles. Without entering into the
substance of this kind of reading, it will be illuminating to explore the
enlarged dimensions of this confrontation, as the midrash reads it.
In a classic analysis, for example, the word va-yiggash is refracted into
three possible modalities of intimacy (lit., he drew close): war,  
appeasement, and prayer.4 Appeasement and prayer seem quite compatible with
the context of a Judah trying to stir compassion in the breast of the
inscrutable viceroy, or with a reading that has Judah ever-conscious of
God as the ultimate arbiter of the family's fate.
The motif of belligerence, however, seems difficult to assimilate to a
conventional reading of the text. And yet, in a whole range of midrashim,
Judah's speech is not simply a plea for mercy: it becomes an angry,
reproachful, even menacing attack on Joseph. The very thought of
separating Benjamin from his brothers—Joseph's judicious sentence,

The Pit and the Rope
319
with its prospect of shalom, "peace," for the other brothers—sends Judah
into a paroxysm of rage:
When Judah's anger swelled, two hairs would go out of his heart and
tear through his garments. And when he wanted his anger to swell, he
would fill his belt with brass pellets, take some of them and grind them
between his teeth —and his anger would swell. When Joseph saw
Judah's power (for of him it is said: "The king's wrath is a messenger of
death, but a wise man can appease it" [Proverbs 16:14]—the "king's
wrath" refers to Judah, while the "wise man" refers to Joseph, as it said,
"There is none so discerning and wise as you" [Genesis 41:39]) — when
Joseph saw Judah's anger swelling, he said, "Now Egypt will perish."
This is like two athletes who were held in a tense struggle—when one
was about to be defeated, he said, "Now he will defeat me, and I shall be
shamed in front of everyone." What did he do? He kissed his rival's
hand, and the stronger athlete's anger abated. So when Joseph felt
Judah's anger, he was afraid lest he be shamed in front of the Egyptians:
immediately, he said to his brothers, "I am Joseph your brother," and
they could not answer him.5
This unexpected reading of the confrontation between Judah and
Joseph is paralleled by many others. In all, the encounter is marked by
anger, royal power, and menace on the side of Judah, and by a strategic
retreat on the part of Joseph. In some of these readings, the animal
typology of Judah as a lion, and Joseph as an ox (from Jacob's deathbed
blessings) is deployed.6 In others, the opposition between Judah's power
and Joseph's wisdom is elaborated. But the basic notion of a belligerent
encounter, with Judah as the aggressor, does seem highly unexpected. A
realistic dramatic sense of the situation would seem to cast Judah in the
role of eloquent pleader, playing on the chords of empathy and  
sentiment, flattering Joseph's omnipotence and moral conscience, beseeching
him to move beyond justice, even beyond the generous justice of  
exonerating the innocent brothers of any share in the crime.
This mode of eloquence, which the midrash calls lashon rakah, "the
soft tongue," does not, however, according to a wide range of midrashic
sources, and according to Rashi's reading, characterize Judah's tone.
Instead, these sources attribute to him lashon kasbab? "the harsh tongue."
Like Joseph himself (42:7), he speaks harshly, challenging the ruler with
all his personal power, attacking him for his past dealings with the
brothers—even threatening to assassinate him and his royal master, or, in

320
VA-YIGGASH
other sources, to run amok in the city, massacring the population. For
example, here is Rashi's commentary on one phrase of Judah's speech:
"for you are the equal of Pharaoh": "You are as important in my eyes as
the king." This is the plain meaning. The midrashic reading: "You will
in the end be afflicted with leprosy, as Pharaoh was, when he kept
Sarah, my great-grandmother, for one night in his palace." Or—
another reading—"Just as Pharaoh decrees and does not fulfill his
decree, promises and does not perform, so do you. Is this what you
meant when you promised to keep your eye on Benjamin?" Or—
another reading—"You are just like Pharaoh—if you provoke me, I
shall kill both you and your master."
In this passage, Rashi understands the obviously conciliatory tone of
Judah's rhetoric as the plain meaning of the text, with the menacing,
reproachful notes detected by the midrash as undertones. Ramban  
elaborates on this idea, which possibly originates in the midrashic comment
that Judah spoke "both softly and harshly":8 he emphasizes the covert
nature of Judah's attack on the ruler, and particularly on the "plot" that
Joseph had woven to entangle them from the beginning (the gratuitous
questions about their family background, the charge of spying, the
demand to bring Benjamin as evidence of the truth of their story). In
Ramban's view, there is anger hidden in Judah's words, though he dare
not express it unambiguously.
In the midrashic sources, however, the anger is isolated and becomes
dominant. In the extraordinary surrealistic imagery of the Tanbuma
passage, hairs protrude erect from his chest and pierce his clothes. Or—
with a telling precision—when he wants to swell with anger, he chews on
brass pellets to feed his rage. This is a Judah who intentionally becomes
the very personification of an anger that is identified in the midrash with
kingly power. There is an appropriateness to this anger; through his
capacity to feel and to express feeling, Judah defeats Joseph in the contest
that, with a kind of formality—it is a game, a sport—is being fought by
the two of them.
Joseph concedes defeat to Judah. In the midrash, he reveals himself to
his brothers, not because he is overcome by emotion, but because he has
to put an end to the contest before he is embarrassingly trounced by
Judah's power. By revealing himself, he limits the damage Judah is able to
do to him—his brothers are "unable to answer him": he has achieved a
paradoxical equipoise of power in surrender.

The Pit and the Rope
321
This reading of the confrontation sits uncomfortably on the text, on
conventional understandings of the narrative. What is the quality of
Judah's anger? A moment before, he proclaimed his guilt and  
speechlessness, overwhelmed by memories of the past. He was ready to accept
slavery for all eleven brothers. And now—arguing for an obfuscation of
justice, the innocent replacing the guilty—he suddenly seethes with
deliberate, self-generated anger, which breaks up Joseph's game, and
proves Judah's rights to royal status in the family?
This change of mood, corresponding to the break in the narrative, is
precipitated, I suggest, by Joseph's use of the word sbalom: "the rest of
you go back in peace to your father" (44:17). Shalom, peace, wholeness—
the notion strikes Judah's ear as exquisitely wrong in this context.
For Jacob's family had been raised to the ideal ofsbalom, of wholeness.
The objective correlative of that ideal was the birth of twelve children;
the number twelve (as, for instance, in the twelve signs of the zodiac) is
commonly treated in midrashic sources as suggesting cosmic  
completeness. The loss of Joseph was a fatal fracture of that symbolic wholeness.9
Ironically, he was lost on a mission to "see the sbalom, the peace of your
brothers and of the sheep" (37:14). Jacob sent him to investigate the
apparent idyll of household integrity; while engaged on this research
project ("See . . . and bring me back word"), he disappeared. Jacob's
wholeness is shattered; thereafter, Simeon disappears (he "is not" [42:36]);
and now Joseph wants to remove Benjamin too.
From the reader's perspective, there is an outrageous quality to
Joseph's bland direction to his brothers to "go back in peace"; all three
disturbances of the family's wholeness can, in a sense, be laid to his door.
He is personally responsible for the progressive fragmentation of the
family, because of his tendency to "see . . . and bring back word." As the
household detective, he "brought evil report to their father" (37:2).
Rashi comments: "Every evil that he would see in his brothers he would
tell his father." From the beginning, there was a kind of seeing in Joseph
that broke the peace, that probed beyond the surfaces, and that led to the
disintegration of the family.
Clearly, the irony of Joseph's use of the word sbalom is more manifest
to the reader than to the participants in the drama. Even from the
brothers' viewpoint, however, there is a tension in the scene where Joseph
greets his brothers, when they bring Benjamin down to Egypt: he  
insistently inquires after their sbalom — and especially after their father's

322
VA-YIGGASH
shalom: "He greeted them [le-shalom\y and he said, 'How [ha-shalom] is
your aged father of whom you spoke? Is he still in good health [lit., still
alive]?' They replied, 'It is well [shalom] with your servant our father; he is
still in good health.' And they bowed and made obeisance" (43:27-28).
This dialogue, its formal courtesy indicated by the obeisance, covers
dangerous depths. Both Joseph and his brothers know of the pressures
that assail Jacob's shalom. Joseph focuses the question onto the minimal
matter of survival: "Is he still alive?" And the brothers answer,  
confirming that he is still alive, but skimming over the incommunicable problems
evoked by the mention of shalom, in connection with their father.
This encounter, however, takes place at a moment when the brothers
are hopeful of restoring both Simeon and Benjamin to Jacob. But when
Joseph speaks of their returning le-shalom—at the very moment when he
condemns Benjamin to slavery—something snaps in Judah. "They said
to Joseph: 'What shalom can there be, when it is all darkened [or poured
away]?' "10 Judah savagely picks up on Joseph's word shalom; the whole of
his speech can be read as a demand to restore the disintegrated wholeness
of Jacob's house.
Joseph and Judah: the pit and the rope
Such a belligerent reading of Judah's speech still remains difficult. The
dynamic of his speech becomes enigmatic: what is the nature of this
transaction that leads to Joseph's revealing his identity? If it is not pathos
only that informs Judah's words, what is the force, the "kingly" power he
brings to bear on Joseph that pressures him to a tactical retreat?
"Then Judah went up to him": "The designs in a man's mind are deep
waters, but a man of understanding can draw them out" [Proverbs
20:5]. "The designs in a man's mind are deep waters" refers to Joseph.
But as much as Joseph was wise, Judah came and defeated him, as it is
said, "Then Judah went up to him." What does this resemble? A deep
pit into which no one could climb down. Then a clever person came
and brought a long rope that reached down to the water so he could
draw from it. So was Joseph deep, and Judah came to draw from him.11
According to this midrash, the relation between Joseph and Judah is
based on the notion that Joseph represents an absolute, inaccessible
quality that onlyjudah knows how to reach and to negotiate. Only he can

The Pit and the Rope
323
draw up the deep water with his rope: this is his "conquest" of Joseph.
Joseph, in his wisdom, has an inscrutable quality; Judah has the  
pragmatic ability to make that wisdom work in the world. In William James's
terms, Judah knows how to test the "cash value" of Joseph's hiddenness
and power. James writes: "The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property
inherent in it. Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by
events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process: the process namely of its
verifying itself, its veri-fication. Its validity is the process of its valid-tfriow."12
Judah, I suggest, encounters Joseph in a similar mode of process against
essence: he is the rope that draws the deep (stagnant?) water into the
sunlit, changing world.
This is signified by the word va-yiggasb.li Judah comes close to
Joseph's pulse of secret life and forces it into expression. In doing so,
Judah claims a certain power of kingship—a pragmatic power to  
communicate, to influence, to shape the public articulations of private desire and
perception. Joseph, on the other hand, expresses a pure principle of
kingship: holding his own counsel, owing explanation to no one,  
responsible to no one, secret, provident.
In this view, Judah's anger is part of the armory of the leader who
knows how to make things happen in the world. Judah knows about
change, about sin and repentance, about contingency and a pain that
alters perception. In another version of the Tanhuma midrash, he knows
how to "tie rope to rope, cord to cord, twine to twine,"14 in order to reach
down into Joseph's pit. He is a master of instrumentality, of expression.
The image of the rope evokes distance and connection: Judah  
acknowledges the opaqueness, the differences among human beings, but he
engineers techniques to draw what is most private into the public area—
"until he penetrated to his heart."
At first, he is silent; he in fact proclaims his necessary silence ("What
can we say?"). But then he takes hold of the rope and he speaks, at great
length and to radical effect. Indeed, in several midrashic sources, Joseph
challenges him: Who has appointed him spokesman (dabran, or path) of
his brothers, since he is not the eldest? To speak is, implicitly, to lead, to
tie rope to rope, and bring hidden things to the surface. What gives Judah
the energy to undertake, even usurp this role? This is his answer:
"In spite of the fact that there are brothers older than me, they stand
outside the relationship, while I [lit.] feel my bowels cramping  
[twisting] like a rope." Joseph asked him, "How?" And Judah replied,

324
VA-YIGGASH
"Because I am surety for him." Joseph said, "If it is a question of silver
or gold, I shall give you the amount." And Judah said, "It is not a matter
of silver or gold. For this is what I told Father: 'I shall be banished in this
world and in the world to come.' "15
Judah speaks, assumes the responsibility to achieve something beyond
guilty silence, because he must. A visceral involvement with Benjamin,
painful (the word bevel means both "rope" and "suffering," particularly,
"labor pains"), undeniable, binds him to all eternity. When he  
proclaimed himself surety for Benjamin to his father, "I was tied in a strong
knot to be banished in both worlds" (Rashi, 44:32).16
The recurrence of the rope image is fascinating. The twisting and
folding of the fibers of the rope expresses the complicated, painful
involvements by which a Judah gains his power of leadership, his capacity
to probe depths and retrieve what was hidden for public use. His  
pragmatism, his empirical approach to reality, come to a head in the question of
"surety," in his strange commitment to Jacob for Benjamin's safe return.
Lhe one who must pay"
Jacob had refused to let Benjamin go to Egypt: an absolute refusal ("My
son shall not go with you" [42:38]), which even Reuben's melodramatic
offer—to kill his own two sons, if Benjamin failed to return—cannot
affect. But Judah waits "till the bread is consumed from the house," as the
midrash puts it. At the right moment, he speaks—at length and to good
effect. He evokes the magical "seeing of the king's face," which means
life: without Benjamin, there will be no further audiences with the food
provider in Egypt.17 For the sake of life, he appeals to Jacob: "I myself will
be surety for him [e'ervenu]; you may hold me responsible:18 if I do not
bring him back to you and set him before you, I shall stand guilty before
you forever" (43:9). Unlike Reuben, Judah himself offers to stand in for
Benjamin, to bear the total responsibility for him. Benjamin will be
"with" him personally; Judah will be legally liable to pay, personally,
intimately, and eternally, if Benjamin should fail to return.
The legal imagery of "standing surety" (arev) traces the precise  
parameters of Judah's commitment to Jacob. In economic situations, the
guarantor commits his own resources to cover the debt of others. To
promise to return goods given to oneself is simply to commit oneself to
pay back a loan. The concept of "surety," however, is much more far-

The Pit and the Rope
325
reaching, even, one might say, fundamentally absurd. For the guarantor
assumes responsibility that properly belongs to others, to the real debtor,
and covers for situations where chance, pure contingency, may cause
disaster.
This concept of "surety" finds its first narrative paradigm in Judah's
offer to Jacob.19 He does not merely take Benjamin and promise to return
him: that would be equivalent to a debtor's promise to return a loan.
Rather, he personally assumes total responsibility for a communal  
obligation. Jacob says, in plural form, "Take your brother" (43:13), while Judah
emphasizes the first-person singular form in his commitment: "/ shall
stand surety . . . from my hand you may seek him."
Surety thus involves an obscuring of boundaries, particularly of the
most basic boundary that separates individuals. It is based, in a sense, on a
legal fiction. It proclaims a confusion {arav means "to mix") of identities
that can come to roost in sheer economic terms: the debtor fails to pay,
and the guarantor finds himself solely responsible, a grotesque economic
surrogacy giving reality to the fiction. For the basic definition of the
"guarantor" is that "he is the one who must pay."20
Judah, similarly, is the one who must pay, through whom the "cash
value" of words is to be most rigorously validated. He stands personally
responsible for Benjamin, though all the brothers take him down to
Egypt. When the goblet is found in Benjamin's sack, the midrash relates:
"Each of the other brothers turned his face aside. And who stood against
Joseph? The guarantor—'Then Judah went up to him.'" Implied in the
guarantor position is an ability to "stand against," to resist: to summon
up resources of anger, irony, and menace in protection of that with which
one is identified. For the "guarantor," the barriers of personhood are
down: he becomes real, as the rope of pain and involvement twists in his
bowels.
Judah's growth to moral vision
A poignant suggestion about Judah's growth to his full stature is made in
Tanbuma, 9. Immediately after Jacob cries for the loss of his son Joseph,
Judah "goes down" to Timna, marries, has three children, and is  
bereaved of two of them, in circumstances that seem to incriminate his
daughter-in-law, Tamar. It is this theme of the death of children that the
midrash takes up: " 'And his father wept for him\* [37:35]. God said to

326
VA-YIGGASH
Judah, \* You have had no children until now, and you do not know the pain
of children. You have tortured your father, and misled him to say, "Joseph
was torn by a beast!" As you live, you shall marry a woman and bury your
children, and you shall know the pain of children/ "
The midrash continues to tell of Judah's personal responsibility for
Joseph's sale, and of his resulting loss of status among his brothers
("Then Judah went down"). Only when he stands surety for Benjamin,
and Joseph reveals himself, is he reinstated as leader of the family. Then,
Jacob's suspicions of his role in Joseph's murder are allayed, and Jacob
chooses him to represent the family, "sending him ahead" to blaze the
trail to Egypt (46:28).
This midrash connects Judah's moral growth with his experience of
the "pain of children." His experience of bereavement, the wrenching in
the bowels at his own losses, teaches him empathy—belatedly—with
Jacob, in his loss. The "pain of children" is, moreover, a hauntingly
general expression, seeming to indicate something of the notion that
children are hostages of fortune. A peculiar vulnerability is experienced
only through parenthood; a pristine arrogance is punctured when one
has children, to whom anything can happen. The full contingency of the
human condition is known when one's children are touched by fate.
Judah becomes human when his children are born; the midrash mentions
his children's deaths as the extreme example of the fatality to which he is
laid open.
With the carelessness of the childless, Judah has tormented his father.
Tiganta—the word used to express torment—has basic meanings of an
instrument of torture and execution, unimaginable physical agony. The
midrash focuses on this anguish and on Judah's responsibility for it. His
growth to responsibility and leadership is calibrated on a gauge of pain
and empathy. Initiated into the fellowship of pain, Judah becomes  
capable of investing the whole force of his personhood into preventing its
recurrence.
Judah stands surety for Benjamin: just as previously, in the context of
his children's deaths, he had left with Tamar—twice-widowed of his two
sons—a pledge (eravon), in lieu of payment for sleeping with her. The
pledge that Judah had left was his seal, his cord, and staff: the emblems of
his leadership. Symbolically, Tamar demands his self in pledge. She
produces these emblematic expressions of his responsibility, just as,
pregnant with his children, she is about to be burnt for profligacy: "I am

The Pit and the Rope
327
with child by the man to whom these belong. . . . Please recognize these:
whose seal and cord and staff are these?" (38:25).
When she says, "Recognize these," she appeals for a kind of vision, a
way of seeing her and their connection that is tantamount to spiritual
recognition: "Recognize your Creator, and do not hide your eyes from
me," she says in the midrashic narrative.21 For Judah had not been
visually proficient, earlier in the story: "When Judah saw her, he took her
for a harlot; for she had covered her face" (38:15).
The same midrash explains the logic of his blindness. It was not that
the veil convinced him that she was a prostitute; rather, because she had
constantly veiled herself in her father-in-law's house, he had never really
seen her face, and was, therefore, easily duped. The fact that he did not
recognize her, therefore, was rooted in their past relationship. He had
never really seen her. On the one hand, this is praised as a proper modesty
between father-in-law and daughter-in-law;22 but on the other, it is held
up as an example of dangerous and even immoral blindness.23 The latter
midrash implies that Judah should have insisted on seeing the face of
Tamar. She, however, "saw that Shelah was grown up, yet she had not
been given to him as wife" (38:14). Her sense of purpose had informed a
strong, empirical vision of her reality; and had led her to unconventional
but necessary action.
Now, Judah responds to her plea for moral vision: for a complex sense
of connection and responsibility: "Judah recognized them, and said, 'She
is more in the right than F " (38:26). Judah's public confession is praised
in the same midrash as "sanctifying God's Name in public." It is the public
nature of his acknowledgment that distinguishes him from Joseph, who
"sanctified God's Name in private" (in his sexual encounter with
Potiphar's wife).
These are two different kinds of heroism. Joseph emphatically rejects
his master's wife, so that—if she had not revealed the affair—nothing
need ever have been known of it; for this he is rewarded with one letter of
God's Name.24 Judah, however, sins, both in withholding his youngest
son from Tamar and in sleeping with her, and when the results of his act
have become visible, a public fact, he justifies her behavior and publicly
confesses; for this, the midrash notes, his name is read as including the
whole of God's Name (Yehuda includes the four letters of the Tetragram-
maton).

328
VA-YIGGASH
The difference between Judah and Joseph, which the Talmud, in
Sotah, indicates here, relates to publicity, to acts consummated,  
confessed, and repented. Judah acts in full consistency with his nature,
registering in his speech and behavior the changes in his inwardness. He
is a person invested in the process of "becoming": the root meaning of
God's Name, as God explains it to Moses: "I shall be what I shall be"
(Exodus 3:14).
Vulnerable, dynamic, responsive with all his being, Judah becomes the
paradigm of responsibility and leadership. When Tamar appeals to him,
"Please recognize these," another appeal for recognition resonates in the
words. Judah, now schooled in pain and loss, hears within her voice his
own voice, saying to his father, "Please recognize it; is it your son's tunic
or not?" (37:32). The midrash notices the irony of this spot in time, the
double exposure effect of the same words, spoken in two different  
contexts: "With the word baker [recognize], he brought news to his father;
with the word baker, he had news brought to him." His own callousness
revives in his memory and generates a full acknowledgment, an act of
vision that registers his own "becoming," the processes by which he
learns to see better.
Robert Alter discusses the version of the midrash that appears in
Beresbit Rabbah 84:19: "You said to your father, Haker na\ as you live,
Tamar will say to you, Hakerna" Alter objects to the direct moral rebuke
that God administers to Judah in this version of the midrash. His  
objection is primarily to the suggestion that Judah is conscious of the  
connections between the two situations. The dramatic irony is palpable to the
audience, but should not be to the protagonist:
The preservation of Judah's ignorance here is important, for the final
turn of his painful moral education must be withheld for the quandary
in which he will find himself later when he encounters Joseph as
viceroy of Egypt without realizing his brother's identity. The Midrash,
on the other hand, concentrating on the present moment in the text
and on underscoring a moral point, must make things more explicit
than the biblical writer intended.25
To this, one might respond that the two different versions (Beresbit
Rabbah and Sotah) present two options of interpretation: the passage in
Sotah advises the reader of the irony of the echo, while the Beresbit

The Pit and the Rope
329
Rabbah passage suggests that God speaks directly to Judah, eroding his
ignorance, even at this early stage of his moral career.
Even if one focuses on the latter reading, however, the midrash, it
seems, is contributing to precisely what Alter claims is the innovative
effect of the biblical narrative: the "indeterminacy of meaning . . . [which
is] conceived as a process, requiring continual revision." When God draws
Judah's attention to the echoing appeal for recognition, this echo is not
"spelled out with a thematically unambiguous closure." In midrashic
rhetoric, God's rebuke is an evolving idea in Judah's mind; he is free to
ignore it, to ponder it, to act on it in multiple ways.
The echoing haker na urges him to ever-clearer vision of his reality,
and of his own standing within that reality. But his "moral education," as
Alter puts it, surely begins here, in this episode of recognition based on
painful experience. His own deception of his father lies at the base of that
whole education.
"As wisdom grows, vexation grows" (Ecclesiastes 1:18). R. Nahman
comments: the greater the sensibility, the greater the pain.26 There is no
acquiring knowledge, or understanding, without a sense of the enlarged
dimensions of the world. This sense R. Nahman calls yirab — fear; and
from this kind of fear comes pain. From this point of view, Judah lives in
an ever-enlarging world: his consciousness grows, and with it the pain
that is his human response to the tug of the rope.
From Tamar, he learns the meaning of the word arev—pledge,  
guarantee: the total symbolic replacement of one for the other. This is always, in
a sense, an outrageous notion. It requires an act of imagination, a way of
seeing, to validate the legal fiction. Judah might have denied that poetic
surrogate force of the pledges, as he earlier manipulated the surrogate
force of Joseph's coat. Haker na, in its pleading form, acknowledges
Judah's freedom to accept or reject the symbolic displacement of the
objects Tamar holds out to him. She will not force his hand.
Similarly, when Judah comes to confront Joseph, he is free to  
acknowledge or ignore that bizarre confusion of separate identities that he has
evoked in his commitment to his father: anokhi e'ervenu, "I shall stand
surety for him." Justice is with Joseph, as he discriminates between guilty
and innocent. As a first response, recognizing a primal guilt, the  
"innocent" brothers tear their clothes together with the "guilty" one. Then,
Judah takes command: "Then Judah and his brothers came into Joseph's
house . . ." (44:14).

judah redescribes himself: direct optics as ethics
The moment is fraught with significance: the brothers, always  
considered as a plural, communal entity, are suddenly represented by an
individual, a personal voice. Joseph continues to address them as a group
("He said to them")\ but Judah alone answers, bewailing the inadequacy
of words, speaking of God who has brought the sediment of an old sin to
the surface, and offering all the brothers as slaves. Judah puts into words,
in a first formulation, his sense that Benjamin cannot be separated from
his brothers. Joseph rejects this unjust sentence, and Judah launches into
his speech.
Poignant, belligerent, or prayerful—or all simultaneously—Judah's
speech makes one basic statement. Attaching "rope to rope," phrase to
phrase, he recounts the narrative that is already known to us.27 In
speaking of the past, however, and in imagining the future, Judah is doing
something new. Sefat Emet expresses the point in a play on the words: va-
yiggash eilav—"Then Judah went up to himself, to his own essence."28
This is a speech of self-analysis, of redescription. In it, Judah discovers
a new vocabulary to say something that had never been said before. What
he says, quite simply, is this: "I have seen my father's anguish at the loss of
Joseph—I have heard him describe an absence ["I have not seen him
since"]. My eyes have learned to cross his line of sight, to see that absence
too.29 And if I should have to see another such absence, I should not be
able to bear the sight."
Essentially, Judah has transformed the story into his own story.  
Ultimately, it is not his father's anguish, or the family's trouble, that he is
describing: it is his own pain of involvement and empathy. Before Joseph's
eyes, he constructs the anger and pathos of his own consciousness. The
climax of his speech is his last sentence, which provokes Joseph's collapse:
"For how can I go back to my father unless the boy is with me? Let me not
see the woe that would overtake my father" (44:34). He has redescribed
himself in a new vocabulary of intimate relationship: a vocabulary that
suggests what it is like to see the other seeing, and not to be able to bear
seeing what he sees.
Emmanuel Levinas writes: "The Torah is given in the Light of a face.
The epiphany of another person is ipso facto my responsibility toward
him: seeing the other is already an obligation toward him. A direct optics—
without the mediation of any idea—can only be accomplished as ethics"\*0 The

The Pit and the Rope
331
"direct optics" in Judah's speech leads him to understand the painful
twisting of the rope wherever it exists: in the empathy between Jacob and
Joseph—"His life is bound up with his"; between Judah and Jacob;
ultimately, between Joseph and Judah.
Judah speaks the simple language of personal feeling, contingent,
without recourse to theoretical or moral propositions. It is not because it
is wrong, on a metaphysical level, to leave Benjamin in slavery, that Judah
makes his plea: it is because from his private and idiosyncratic  
perspective, it is impossible for Judah to see his father seeing "that the boy is not"
(44:30).
Judah redescribes the whole narrative, beginning with Joseph's strange
questions, the plot in which he entangled his brothers.
All he wanted was to get out from under finite powers by making their
finitude evident. He did not want to befriend power nor to be in a
position to empower others, but simply to free himself from the  
descriptions of himself offered by the people he had met. He wanted not
to be merely the person these other people thought they knew him to
be, not to be frozen in the frame of a photograph shot from another
person's perspective. He dreaded being, in Sartre's phrase, turned
into a thing by the eye of the other. . . . His method of freeing himself
from those people—of becoming autonomous—was to redescribe the
people who had described him.31
This passage is taken from Richard Rortys analysis of Proust as
"ironist liberal," in which he argues that the ironist is the rebel against
"final vocabularies," the received notions of propositional truths. Proust
had written a book, and thus created a self— the author of that book—
which these people could not have predicted or even envisaged. He had
become as much of an authority on the people whom he knew as his
younger self had feared they might be an authority on him. This feat
enabled him to relinquish the very idea of authority, and with it the idea
that there is a privileged perspective from which he, or anyone else,
is to be described.32
Judah, too, rejects privileged perspectives in his speech. Even the
name of God—with which Judah is so totally identified, by his capacity
for public confession33 — does not figure in this act of self-creation. His
one reference to God, as having "uncovered the crime of your servants"

332
VA-YIGGASH
(44:16), had used the Name Elobim and had led to silence and  
acquiescence in guilt and indiscriminate punishment.
Now, he is after different game: the unit of persuasion is "a vocabulary
rather than a proposition"; his method is "redescription rather than
inference."34 Using his anger and his pathos, he invests old words with
new meanings, so that by the end of a narrative in which no detail is new he
has constructed a radical criticism of Joseph and all he stands for.  
"Nothing," writes Rorty, "can serve as a criticism of a person save another
person ... for persons . . . are, for us, incarnated vocabularies."35
In this sense, Judah's speech can be read as a personal litany,36 a chain
of words and images that have peculiar resonance for himself. In a project
of self-creation, he lists the events, the experiences that have meshed
together to created the unique world of his selfhood. His inspired
articulation of contingency, of the particulars of his own life, represents a
recognition of God, without reference to the authoritative perspective of
a privileged vocabulary.
A classic midrash narrates that the angel of transcendental truth
advised God against creating man. God threw it down to earth; it
shattered, and must now grow out of the earth in splintered, contingent
shards—"Truth springs up from the earth" (Psalms 85:12).37 The  
personal litany of a human being is such a project of producing personal
truth "from the earth." And Judah's greatness lies precisely in this
capacity to redescribe himself, rooted in earth, aspiring to a personal
vocabulary, in which the splintered letters of God's Name can be
detected.38
judah inspires Joseph: the personal litany
The power of such a personal litany is paradoxical. Precisely because
Judah presents himself in his contingency, in the intimate vocabulary that
weaves his uniqueness, he moves Joseph to remove his mask. Speaking
with all the force of his private experience, Judah evokes the lost wholeness
of the family, and stirs Joseph to his own attempt at self-redescription.
Essentially, what Joseph does in response to Judah's speech is —not
reveal himself—but create himself in words. First, he says, "I am Joseph.
Is my father still alive?" His anxious question about his father is logically
redundant—he had asked them the same question when they arrived in
Egypt shortly before (43:27). Moreover, when his brothers "could not

The Pit and the Rope
333
answer him, so dumbfounded were they on account of him" (45:3), he
repeats and amplifies his self-description: "I am your brother Joseph,
whom you sold into Egypt" (45:4) —but he does not repeat his question
about his father, in the course of the long speech that follows. In fact,
although he refers to his father several times in the course of his speech,
he does not express any further anxiety about his survival.
This spontaneous question: "Is my father still alive?" should, however,
be understood as Joseph's first, poignantly incoherent attempt to find a
vocabulary in which to describe himself. Judah's confession of personal
truth inspires him to a similar spontaneity; and he uncovers the two
hidden preoccupations of his masquerade: his identity, and his concern
that the masquerade, compounding with his original disappearance, has
made his father's life impossible.
The narrative against shame
Here, one of the central questions about Joseph's behavior arises. Ram-
ban asks it, as do many other commentators: how could Joseph not
communicate with his father, at least during the years of his success and
power? Some powerful restraint bars him from relieving his beloved
father of his anguish. The question is, of course, exacerbated by the
protracted torment to which he subjects his whole family—his charge
that his brothers are spies, the money hidden in their sacks, the "planted"
goblet. These make an enigma of the whole narrative.
OrHa-hayyim offers a simple, but totally convincing answer:39 Joseph
is paralyzed by the prospect of his brothers' shame, if he reveals himself to
his father. This is a genetic sensitivity: his mother, Rachel, according to a
classic midrash, had been so horrified at the idea that her sister, Leah,
masquerading as Rachel, would be shamed on her wedding night, that
she gave her the secret signs that Jacob had given her, to prevent just such
a deception (Rashi, 29:25) To prevent his brothers' shame, Joseph has,
like his mother, kept silent, while his heart yearned to express itself.40
When his brothers actually appear before him for the first time,
passivity and silence are neither possible nor necessary. From this point
on, Joseph engages in an active project of discovery, the aim of which is to
produce evidence that will allow his brothers to endure his  
"resurrection" without shame.

334
VA-YIGGASH
We shall return to this project of Joseph; here, we can simply notice
the irony that, in spite of Joseph's prophylactic strategy, the brothers are
"dumbfounded" when he first reveals himself. It is shame, says Rashi
(45:1, 4, 15), that silences them. One effect of this shame, as Joseph had
feared, is violence and anger: in several midrashic sources, Joseph's life is
in danger, at the moment he identifies himself, so tormented are his
brothers by the disgrace of their situation.41
For while shame, in classical theological thought, is often considered
as forerunner to a positive rearticulation of one's life,42 it is also a volatile,
potentially dangerous response. The lowering of the brothers' moral
profile threatens to have self-fulfilling effects; it may drive them to
despair, to silence — even to murder the source of their shame. It is for this
reason that Joseph, seeing that his first attempt at self-description is
generating just that response that he had most feared, engages in a much
fuller, more elaborate attempt to create himself, to discover a vocabulary
that his brothers will be able to appropriate for themselves in their future
narratives of their history.
He begins, surprisingly, by squarely attacking their sore point: "I am
your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt" (45:4). His reference to
the unmentionable fact of the sale is, however, made in a context of
brotherhood. On one level, he is simply identifying himself in the only
way that is totally convincing: this secret of the sale is the most potent
proof of his identity. But he defuses some of the tension of this memory,
by describing himself—in spite of everything—as "your brother."
He then tells them: "Now, do not be distressed or reproach yourselves
because you sold me hither." He lets them know that he understands their
ambivalent response to his reappearance: they are heartbroken at what
they did to him, so many years before, and they are frustrated at their own
humiliation. They are genuinely saddened by their cruelty of the past; at
the same time, they are resentful at the way they have been hoist with
their own petard. Unwilling to bow to the adolescent Joseph, they sold
him into slavery; now they find themselves bowing to him, in entire
subjugation.43
Joseph's strategy is essentially to reveal to his brothers a Joseph
empathic with their inner conflicts. The main thrust of his speech serves
to show them his loving interpretation of his own history: the sale was for
the sake of life, his cruel experience was, in fact, a mission to save his
family from starvation in the famine years. God's plot is the only level of

The Pit and the Rope
335
the narrative that matters to him, he tells them. And ultimately, the
purpose of his speech is to provide them with a narrative to tell their
father, to defuse the shame of their situation. The core of his speech is:
"Now, hurry back to my father and say to him: Thus says your son
Joseph . . ." (45:9) —a message to his father that will proclaim Joseph's
personal credo, his vocabulary of self-creation.
This is the central point: Joseph's speech of reassurance is full of
references to God—unlike Judah's speech. It seems replete with  
theological propositions. But in fact Joseph is not making sententious,  
theoretical statements; he is talking about his personal perspective on his own
life, and he is doing so in order to provide his brothers with the only
stratagem that will help them to scotch their own shame. He gives them a
story to tell their father, to ground the electric furies of their own
humiliation. Formally, his message to his father includes only assurances
of economic security in Egypt. Implicitly, however, Joseph's whole speech is
intended to convey to Jacob —as well as to his sons—that Joseph has
discovered a vocabulary in which to articulate his life.
There is no hatred in his heart: this is the implicit message of his
speech, according to Rashi (45:12). His status and wealth are the direct
result of their guilty act. This is not merely a fact; it forms the basis of
Joseph's most personal life litany.
The point is made succinctly by Sefat Emet, who comments on  
Joseph's opening statement: "I am your brother Joseph, he whom [asher]
you sold." For him, Joseph is neither simply identifying himself, nor
pouring salt on their wound. Instead, he cites the midrash on a parallel
statement, where God speaks to Moses of the Tablets of Stone, "which
[asher] you broke" (Exodus 34:1): "Congratulations [yishar kohakha] that
you broke them!"44 In the long view, the dynamic by which the second set
of Tablets is created is to be more useful to the Jewish  
people—psychologically and spiritually—than the instant gift of the first Tablets.  
Cataclysms are often retrospectively seen as fortunate, the gains outweighing
the losses. In the same way, Sefat Emet suggests,45 Joseph views his life
since he was sold: he comforts his brothers with words only he can utter,
testifying to an inner conviction that his fall into the pit was a fortunate
moment in their shared history.
Joseph succeeds in allaying the anguish of the moment: "only then
were his brothers able to talk to him" (45:15). But the shame and fear
never disappear entirely. At the very end of the narrative, after Jacob's

336
VA-YIGGASH
death, they surface again, as Joseph's brothers appeal to him for their
lives, in such terms as to reduce him, yet again, to tears (50:15-18). A
residue of that shame poisons their relationship to the end.
Joseph's project abandoned
In a sense, then, Joseph was premature in ending his masquerade:  
"Joseph could no longer control himself' (45:1). Self-control (hifapek) is a
concept that has been deployed before, to describe a previous paroxysm
of Joseph's tears (43:31). It is an unusual word; Rashbam suggests that it
describes a mode that had been Joseph's consistently until this point,
when he "could no longer" maintain it. The word implies "strength":46
Joseph had previously succeeded, despite his yearning and his tears, in
holding himself in strength; now, he "cannot" keep himself firm in his
resolve.
A graphic sense of his emotional conflict is given in Rashi's etymology
of nikhmeru, the word that describes his yearning towards his brother
Benjamin: UiHe was overcome' [43:30]: nikhmeru means 'was heated.'. . .
In the Bible [Lamentations 5:10]: 'Our skin as by an oven was heated' — it
was heated and shrank into many wrinkles because of the pangs of
hunger; such is the nature of every skin when it is heated, it wrinkles and
shrivels." This vivid description of the shriveling effect of emotion is then
balanced by the statement, va-yitapak—"but he made himself firm,
strong in resolve."
There is an idea at work in Joseph, that he holds on to, through all the
erosive effects of compassion. After Judah's speech, he "cannot"  
maintain his strength. Implicitly, his resolve collapses. A project tenaciously
pursued since the brothers appeared in the Egyptian court is discarded.
Joseph, the all-powerful ruler [mekhalkel—the provider, which can be
read punningly to yield the sense of complete control of resources, hakol
yakhol\ finds himself suddenly, like his brothers, in the helpless condition
of lo yakhol— incapacity.
From the beginning, the brothers are described in terms of such an
incapacity: "they could not speak a friendly word to him" (37:4). Tangled
in Joseph's plot, their characteristic response is one of helpless  
bewilderment (42:28). Forces incomprehensible to them lie in ambush to deceive
and trap them (43:18). But it is in Judah's speech to Joseph that the motif
of lo yakhol, of a kind of trapped impotence, fully emerges.

The Pit and the Rope

Judah recalls how the ruler had demanded that they bring Benjamin to
Egypt, "that I may set eyes on him. We said to my lord, 'The boy cannot
leave his father; if he were to leave him, his father would die'" (44:22).
They had returned home, and Jacob had demanded that they return to
Egypt for more food: "We answered, 'We cannot go down; only if our
youngest brother is with us can we go down, for we may not show our
faces to the man unless our youngest brother is with us'" (44:26).
Judah conveys a powerful sense of their "double-bind,, situation:
without Benjamin, they cannot buy food, but to take him is equally
impossible —their father will inevitably die. Hemmed in by legal and
psychological impossibilities, the brothers know the full pressure of their
existential situation. They had been "unable to speak in peace to  
Joseph"—compelled by purely inward forces. Like the Egyptians who
"could not" eat together with the Hebrews ("for it was an abomination to
the Egyptians" [43:3 2]), the brothers are subject to the human condition,
in which cultural or psychological barriers limit possibility.47 When
Joseph reveals himself, their hypothetical freedom of response is  
similarly cramped by the paralysis of shame: they "could not answer him, so
dumbfounded were they" (45:3).
In a startling moment of collapse, Joseph rejoins the human race. He
surrenders his project, shriveled, reduced to human size. A sinister
grandiosity had informed that project; now, compassion, the benign
infection of Judah's words, compels him to relinquish his secret idea.
Joseph's experiment: the demand for "ocular proofy
The nature of that idea he had indicated when, in their first interview, he
had told his brothers: "By this you shall be put to the test. . . . that your
words may be put to the test. . . you must bring me your youngest
brother, that your words may be verified and that you may not die"
(42:15, 16, 20).
Joseph's vocabulary had been based on the notion of proof, by bringing
Benjamin back with them, they will bring evidence of the truth of their
story. Clearly—and puzzlingly—Benjamin is being used as evidence of
their authenticity. Rashi's comment is: "Your words will be verified and
established [set firmly in reality]" (42:20). The issue thus seems to be
Joseph's suspicion of language: words can lie, any description of reality
can be uttered, without any necessary basis in fact.

338
VA-YIGGASH
This skepticism of Joseph about the existence of "final vocabularies"
(Rort/s expression) leads him to demand indubitable "ocular proof." He
uses the language of empirical research to make his demand for clear
knowledge, in the form of the visible person of Benjamin. What he wants
to know is not simply that there is a younger brother at home: his whole
experiment aims to elicit visual information about who his brothers are
now—ha-emet itkbem—"Is there truth in you? Have you found a solidity
of being, a loyalty that will not allow you to repeat the crime of the past?"
The experiment is not for his information only. It is, as we have
suggested, a strategy for dealing with the problem of shame, potentially
so dangerous to the survival of the family. It is for his father's sake that he
wants to know, to make empirically obvious, of what stuff his brothers are
now made. It is, most of all, for their information, that he probes and
presses them.
This is the experiment that collapses, that shrivels in the face of
Judah's personal, passionate litany. At this point, however, the purpose of
Joseph's experiment is not our main interest. It is the very notion of an
experimental approach in human affairs that we shall explore: Joseph's
mode of resolving the anguish and silence of his life.
"A wise man has eyes in his head" (Ecclesiastes 2:14): Joseph is the
prototype of the hakbam, of the wise man. He is first described as the
"child of Jacob's old age" (37:3); the Targum translates the Hebrew
expression (ben zikunim) as bar bakima, the wise son, precocious,  
intellectually developed. The wise person makes use of his eyes: he understands
the implications of events. He is vigilant, aware of consequences,  
provident, canny. He can read what is unintelligible to others. For these
qualities, Pharaoh chooses Joseph as viceroy, "for there is none so
discerning and wise as you" (41:39).
But there is a sinister side to this optical awareness. What angered the
brothers in their youth was precisely this sage understanding of the
underside of their lives. He "brought bad reports of them to their father"
(37:2); Rashi comments: "Any evil that he saw in them he would report."
Joseph does not slander his brothers;48 he reports what he sees, but what
he sees is evil, weakness. His is a critical sensibility; his eye does not
merely collate information, but is active in structuring a sinister vision.
The type of the intellectual—abstracting, analyzing, testing—Joseph
is described by Thomas Mann as "always knowing far too well what was
being played."49 The reality-appearance problem—the fundamental

The Pit and the Rope
339
problem in Western philosophy—continually concerns him. He  
willingly engages in play acting, but only in order to elicit the truth from the
other actors, who are less enlightened than he. He seeks clear,  
indubitable knowledge, an unblurred version of the "blooming, buzzing chaos,"
that he is precipitated into, when his brothers throw him into the pit. The
confusion, the bewilderment, the helplessness of the pit is with him
always; but it translates into a desire to achieve the highest possible
definition in his perception of reality.
A congenital tendency is confirmed by experience. The visual  
awareness that is so strong in him is the linchpin in Jacob's final assessment of
him: "Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough akiayin" (49:22). These
last words—as indeed many words of Jacob's blessing— have been  
translated in very different ways. Ayin, however, does most commonly mean
"eye"; and Rashi's first translation emphasizes the visual grace of  
Joseph—the beauty that strikes the eye of others (including the Egyptian
girls who are referred to in the second part of the verse). Rashi's final
reading closes in on a midrash that explains the verse in context of the
whole narrative:
When Esau came to greet Jacob, the mothers went first, in front of
their children, to bow down to him. But regarding Rachel it is written:
"Joseph came near and Rachel and they bowed down" [33:7]. Joseph
said, "This wicked man has haughty eyes—perhaps he will cast his eyes
on my mother?" So he went out in front of her and enlarged his stature
so as to cover her. That is why his father blessed him, saying benporat—
"You have made yourself large, Joseph, over the eyes of Esau.  
Therefore, you have earned greatness."
In this passage, Joseph is praised by his father for recognizing the
arrogant power of the eye, and for attempting to limit it. The dialectical
thrust of the midrash emphasizes both Joseph's empathy with Esau, in his
visual arrogance, with its components of eroticism and power, and his
greatness in taming that arrogance. Because of his beauty, Joseph is the
object of visual admiration and rapacity; but he is see-er, as well as seen,
manipulating the field of vision available to others, arriving at his own
conclusions about their perspectives.
This encounter with Esau becomes emblematic of Joseph's visual
transactions throughout his life. He is driven to master reality, to  
appropriate it through his eyes. Clear knowledge is his aim. Judah concisely

340
VA-YIGGASH
summarizes Joseph's expressions of his empirical quest ("You shall be put
to the test. . . your words shall be verified"), when he reports to his
father: "The man who is lord of the land said to us, 'By this I shall know
that you are honest men'" (42:33).
From Judah, too, we hear a key expression of Joseph's purpose in
bringing Benjamin down to Egypt: "that I may set eyes on him" (44:21).
Implications of surveillance emerge from this image—protective  
surveillance, perhaps—which leads Judah to retort, in the midrashic narrative:
"Is this what you meant by setting eyes on him? Is this concerned  
attention? Or is it blindness, neglect (a pun on simat ayin and samyut ayin)}"50
Through this key expression, Joseph articulates his primary need: for a
clear, visual perception of reality, evidence unequivocal of the truth
behind words. But, as Michel Foucault has demonstrated in Discipline and
Punish, the connections between surveillance, power, and scientific  
experiment are awkwardly close. As Joseph watches, his brothers will be
manipulated into the proper situations for discovery and knowledge.
Judah's pun raises questions about the relation between Joseph's  
"apparatus of observation, recording and training,"51 and a kind of moral
obtuseness. In Judah's experience, seeing has come to mean something
different, more involved, vulnerable, volatile.
jSjnowledge and power
Joseph's image of himself as the all-knowing subject, examining the
world under his microscope, comes to almost parodic expression in his
reproach to his brothers for the presumed theft of the goblet: "Do you
not know that a man like me practices divination?" (44:15). His reproach
is based on a field of shared assumptions: everyone knows, surely, that "a
man like me" would know things not accessible to the ordinary person.
Rashi conveys this nuance in his reading: "Do you not know that an
important person like me knows how to practice divination and to know
through knowledge, and rationality, and understanding, that you have stolen
the goblet?" [italics mine]. Joseph is speaking of "power knowledge" —
the fact that "power produces knowledge . . . that power and knowledge
directly imply one another; that there is no power relation without the
correlative constitution of a field of knowledge, nor any knowledge that
does not presuppose and constitute at the same time power relations."52

The Pit and the Rope
341
Rashi's translation oinahash (divination) deemphasizes the magical or
clairvoyant notion of Joseph's knowledge. After all, the goblet is  
supposed to be his source of clairvoyance (44:5), and this was not in his
possession at this time of his knowledge. Instead, the whole apparatus of
intellectual activities is in his power; it constitutes his eyes, with which he
pries open the secrets of the world.
This is his hokhmah, his wisdom, in the sense of an almost technical
skill in the using of the objects. Rashi's source may be Targum Onkelos,
who translates nahash with badak—xht capacity to examine, scrutinize,
research the truth. This is especially interesting, since Onkelos always
offers a "magical" translation of nahash, where this is clearly  
appropriate;53 here, however, in connection with Joseph's powers, he feels free to
translate the word to mean "inquire, investigate, experience."54
In spite of this "intellectual" translation, however, something of the
"magical" connotations of the word remain, and invest Joseph with a
mystique, a prestige, that sets a distance between their limited  
perceptions ("Do you not know ...?") and his superior knowledge. This is a
manifestation of the power-knowledge mechanism that underlies his
relationship with them, from the time of their appearance in the  
Egyptian court. Even his accusation that they are spies implies that they are
guilty of transgressing the power-knowledge system: trying to gain illicit
knowledge, to "see the nakedness of the land." His accusation, in all its
absurdity, reinforces in them a sense of their own limited perception;
there is so much that he knows, that they do not know.
The brothers express a kind of astounded appreciation of his hokhmah,
his wisdom, in the Bereshit Rabbah narrative, when they tell their father,
"Even the wood of our cradles he revealed to us!"55 This extraordinary
midrash seems to emphasize Joseph's clairvoyant talents: he could  
describe to his brothers what kind of wood their cradles were made of. The
idea is based on the brothers' words in the text: "The man kept asking
about us and our family" (43:7). Moladtenu, the word for "family," is
translated by Maharal as "our rearing as infants."
On this reading, Joseph reveals to them the details of their early
infancy, symbolized in the midrash by the "wood of our cradles." But this
revelation is not, after all, a matter of simple clairvoyancy: "the man kept
asking us" suggests that by dint of asking many questions, Joseph elicited
information from the brothers.

342
VA-YIGGASH
In effect, Joseph engages in a kind of psychoanalysis of his brothers: he
asks questions that lead them to a knowledge beyond any they could have
achieved alone. This is Joseph as inspired therapist, uncovering (the
literal meaning of gilah—"he revealed") buried truths: the wood of their
cradles symbolizing the repressed memories of the earliest time in the
"family romance."
There is, to the brothers' sense, something uncanny about such a
power to elicit knowledge. Rightly, they assume that he saw what was
unseen to them; the dynamic of his questions generated their own
understanding: Uiand we answered him accordingly' [43:7]: in accordance
with his questions" (Rashi). The therapeutic experience reinforces their
sense of his superiority. "How were we to know that he would say?"
expresses the submission of the patient to the manipulation of the
therapist. This process of "transference" experienced by the brothers
is summarized by the word va-yitmehu (43:33)—"they were in a state of
wonder," of dependency tinged with fear of the uncanny. "They  
wondered at his hokhmah"56 at his power to see things, not by clairvoyancy,
but through an intellectual discipline transcending their own.
Joseph yields to Judah: two ways of knowing
Joseph as master knower, with his eyes in his head to examine and
organize the apparent formlessness of the world, uses the vocabulary of
investigation. His aim is clarity, evidence: what he sees he will believe.
The basis of this experimental approach is the fact that people are not
transparent: one cannot master them at a glance, or verify that their
words correspond to reality. Therefore, Joseph's strategy is to set them to
act in ways that will test the credibility of their words.
This strategy is conceived as a response to the real problem of emunah,
of verification, of knowing when and what to believe ("that your words
may be verified" — ve-ye'amnu [42:20]). Even Jacob, after all, did not
believe his sons, when they told him that Joseph was alive and ruler in
Egypt: lo he'emin—he could not grant credence, he could not say amen
with his whole being.57
To "believe," then, is to say "yea"; the word amen, if its letters are
shuffled, becomes ma'en, to refuse, to say, "Nay" — "He refused to be
comforted" (37:35). These are the binary positions of human response to
language: at some subconscious level, Jacob could not accept his sons'

The Pit and the Rope
343
story of death and mangling (Rashi, 37:35); but, after twenty-two years,
he could not quite accept their second story of resurrection.
The trouble with emunah—"yea-saying" — is that one is dealing with
words. Treacherous, opaque, words can distort, mislead. So Joseph  
demands clear, visual evidence "that your words may be verified.,, Then,
Judah stands before him and redescribes himself, creates himself as
empathic seer of his father's seeing, as painfully involved in love and
responsibility; and Joseph's empirical resolve shrivels up. Joseph yields to
the puckerings, the wrinklings of compassion. He yields, essentially, to
the power of Judah. Judah, living the life of constant redescription,
revision, overwhelms Joseph, the searcher for clarity, absolute truth.
Judah's descendant, David, confronts the genetic dilemma of behina, of
empirical testing and its inadequacy as a way to knowledge of human
beings. He presents himself to God, in one of his Psalms, as an object of
testing, of training: "Probe me [behaneni], O Lord, and try me, test my
heart and mind" (26:2). In a classic passage, the Talmud shows David's
realization that no human being should invite such an "investigation" of
himself; immediately after inviting God to "probe" him, he sins with
Batsheva.58
This is, apparently, a statement about human fallibility. It also,  
however, expresses the radical "wrongness" of the language of behina, of
empirical research as a way of knowing human beings. David comes to
recognize the central role of what Sefat Emet simply calls "the help of
heaven" in his life.59 The project of knowing oneself or other human
beings is so complex and entangled that an empirical rationality, a search
for "a final vocabulary," will not do:
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! you would
play upon me, you would seem to know my stops, you would pluck out
the heart of my mystery, you would sound me from my lowest note
to the top of my compass — and there is much music, excellent voice,
in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak.60
Judah, confronting Joseph with all the limitations and the power of
language, is an implicit argument against Joseph's modality of behina, of
rigorous investigation. Joseph is criticized in midrashic sources, as the ox
who "goes forth and all the animals flee from him; he kicks this one, and
gores that one. Then comes the lion, and he cannot stand before him/'61
Joseph is depicted as wreaking havoc among his brothers, in the willful-

344
VA-YIGGASH
ness of his resolve to know. Confronted with Judah, and with Judah's
anger at being the object of knowledge, Joseph is compelled to let the
whole therapeutic project collapse: "he could no longer control  
himself'—armor himself against the force of his brother's words, his self-
creation. Joseph can no longer hold his stance of intellectual immunity.
The habit of "control," of a self-contained, observatory power, that had
informed all his actions till now, shrivels in the heat of a different way of
seeing.62
A rigidity dissolves as he reveals, uncovers, a Joseph never before
seen.63 He speaks many words, achieving the purpose—not of  
knowledge—but of giving his brothers and his father a narrative —  
questionable, not entirely credible — a redescription of the meaning of their lives.
His radical desire at this point is to have them able to speak to him—
"Only then were his brothers able to talk to him" (45:15) — to overcome
the paralysis, the dangerous shame of those who know themselves
observed.
iflausibk constructions of reality
The problem of knowledge remains. Even if the brothers believe that he
really is the long-vanished Joseph (and the midrash suggests that, despite
all his eloquence, Joseph has to show them his circumcision before they
will credit his words),64 how will they convince their father? All they have
is words: no photographs for the hungry eye to devour. In the event, Jacob
does not believe their words.
Joseph addresses the problem quite deliberately: "You can see for
yourselves, and my brother Benjamin for himself, that it is indeed I who
am speaking to you" (45:12). The sentence is strange; on the surface, it
seems to mean either too little or too much ("You can see that I am
speaking to you"; or "You can see that it is I, your brother Joseph, who
am speaking to you"). Joseph seems to offer visual evidence of his
identity—lit., your eyes see that my mouth is speaking to you.
Rashi comments: " Your eyes see' my glory; and that I am your brother,
for I am circumcised like you; moreover, that 'my mouth is speaking to you9
in the Holy Tongue." According to Rashi, there are two proofs here of
Joseph's identity: his circumcision (visual) and his speaking Hebrew
(aural). Ramban objects to the latter evidence. He claims that Hebrew is
the general language in Canaan, and that many educated Egyptians

The Pit and the Rope
345
would speak it. Joseph, therefore, is not offering his use of Hebrew as
evidence of his identity: he is simply drawing attention to his authority
("my mouth") and power to fulfill his promises of economic well-being
for his family.
Rashi's other proof of identity—Joseph's circumcision —is similarly
open to objection. For circumcision is not an exclusive property of
Jacob's family: all the Ishmaelites were circumcised, as well as the  
children of Ketura, Abraham's second wife — and even the Egyptians,  
according to some midrashic sources. What kind of evidence, then, does Joseph
offer his brothers and his father?
Maharal offers an ingenious solution. Each piece of evidence alone —
circumcision, or Hebrew speech — is not conclusive. But both together in
the same person makes coincidence unlikely: a Canaanite who is  
circumcised like an Ishmaelite, or an Ishmaelite who speaks Hebrew like a
Canaanite.
The truth is, of course, that this conjunction of mental sets would not
stand as conclusive identifying evidence in any court. But Joseph  
recognizes it as good enough evidence. In offering it to his brothers, he
implicitly abandons his compulsive need for certainty: he is born into the
world of plausible constructions, with which one works until they are
proven false.
This is an adult world, where conjectures and hypotheses lead one to
beliefs, whose main character, as Karl Popper defines it, is that they are
falsifiable. Both circumcision (milah) and the Hebrew language (lasbori)
evoke associations with the nature of language itself, as a structure of
perception, with which human beings explore their reality. These are not
"final vocabularies"; perception is a constructive process, using whatever
models are available to build a perceptual world.
Jerome Bruner cites a fascinating experiment with infants. He took a
rubber pacifier and linked it up to a projecting system on a screen above
the baby's head. The baby could bring blurred pictures into focus by
sucking on his pacifier; he soon learned to step up his sucking rate in
order to bring the picture into focus. He would then stop and look at it.
When the picture drifted out of focus, he would turn away, suck until the
picture was back in focus, and look at it again. He could also master the
opposite, counter-intuitive situation; in this case, sucking drove the clear
picture out of focus. He would look at the clear picture for as long as

346
VA-YIGGASH
possible without sucking and then "have an exuberant burst of sucking,"
while looking away.65
The infants in Bruner's experiment can learn to construct their visual
world, so that clarity is achieved. The blurred picture is not acceptable;
even the pleasure of sucking gives place to the need for a sharp visual
definition.
This need has informed Joseph's transactions with his world, until his
confrontation with Judah. Now, he has recourse to a less crystalline,
conclusive type of perception: he offers his brothers and his father data of
the eye and of the ear, neither incontrovertible. Together, they form a
plausible construction of reality. Perhaps, after all, the need for absolute
clarity is a property of infants?
This cognitive shift in Joseph, as Judah "defeats" him, allows him to
send his father evidence of a kind that, in the event, his father cannot
believe. For Jacob, too, is a highly visual person, whose suffering for
twenty-two years is summed up in the statement, "I have not seen him
since" (44:28). Jacob's eye works differently, however. "But when they
recounted all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons
that Joseph had sent to transport him, the spirit of their father Jacob
revived" (45:27). He hears and he sees: he hears the full narrative that
Joseph has conveyed through his brothers, and he sees the agalot—the
wagons —that, according to a powerful midrash, act as a coded reminder
of the last Torah passage he had studied with Joseph before his  
disappearance.66 Only then, his eyes and ears informing each other, memory
becoming usable at last, does his spirit revive.
Jacob sees with the eyes of one seeking a narrative: remembering his
complicity in study with Joseph, and knowing it remembered by him, his
one desire is to "see him before I die." A certain force of longing to see, to
understand something essential about his life, revives in him: "The Holy
Presence that had departed from him, dwelt over him again" (Rashi,
45:27).
And indeed, in this sense, he "sees" Joseph: "And Joseph was seen by
him. . . . Then Israel said to Joseph, 'Now I can die, since I have seen that
you are still alive'" (46:29-30).67 A residual doubt is resolved in Jacob
only when he sees Joseph's face. The anxiety that would not let him die in
peace is the anxiety at a narrative that had turned into babble. Now, the
picture clears: he sees life in Joseph's face, the kind of spiritual vitality of
which the Sages say, "The righteous are called the living"68

The Pit and the Rope
347
This is the kind of vision of which Jacob has been deprived for twenty-
two years. One might say that as soon as Joseph yields his single-minded
pursuit of the "ocular proof," Jacob regains the imaginative, re-visionary
use of his eyes.
Jacob: knowing blindness
There are two strange codas to this theme of surrendered vision and
regained vision. In the first, God tells Jacob, as he halts at the Egyptian
border, suddenly afraid, to "go down": "Fear not to go down to Egypt,
for I will make you there into a great nation. I myself will go down with
you to Egypt, and I myself will bring you back; and Joseph's hand shall
close your eyes" (46:3-4). Some commentators think that this last  
sentence describes the presence of the closest mourner, the beloved Joseph,
at Jacob's deathbed; Jacob is promised that Joseph will close his eyes, in
the devout act of the surviving son.
But a different reading is suggested by Meshekh Hokhmah. Joseph's
hand on Jacob's eyes is directly related to the anguish Jacob feels about
"going down" to Egypt. Jacob sees no sense in being compelled to go
into exile, an exile he intuits will be longer than the time for a visit to his
son. What is the purpose of a journey away from his proper place?
God tells him that the mystery of Joseph's fate — his descent and rise to
power—should serve as a paradigm for movements downwards and
upwards, in general. It should act as a "hand on the eyes," preventing his
restless intelligence from probing the ultimate meanings of phenomena
that seem empirically absurd. Joseph's rise to power serves purposes,
some of which become evident with the passage of time; others remain
opaque to human perception.
Joseph's experience, then, is the paradigm of the limitations of vision,
in the sense of rational understanding. The irony is that he, whose
dominant desire had been to see clearly and indubitably, is now primed to
teach his father a kind of blindness, in the face of historical contingency.
This reading of God's words may not be precisely comforting; rather
it reaffirms a tragic sense of the unintelligibility of life, to human eyes.
But— and this is the second coda—Jacob has his own ways of seeing, even
in blindness. On his deathbed, he asks to bless his grandsons:
Then Israel saw Joseph's sons and asked, "Who are these?" And Joseph
said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here."

348
VA-YIGGASH
"Bring them up to me," he said, "that I may bless them." Now, Israel's
eyes were dim with age; he could not see. So [Joseph] brought them
close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them. And Israel said to
Joseph, "I never expected to see you again, and here God has let me see
your children as well." Joseph then removed them from his knees, and
bowed low with his face to the ground. Joseph took the two of them,
Ephraim with his right hand—to Israel's left—and Manasseh with his
left hand—to Israel's right— and brought them close to him. But Israel
stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraim's head—thus
crossing his hands—although Manasseh was the first-born. . . . When
Joseph saw that his father was placing his right hand on Ephraim's
head, he thought it wrong [lit., it was evil in his eyes]; so he took hold of
his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's. "Not
so, Father," Joseph said to his father, "for the other is the firstborn;
place your right hand on his head." But his father objected, saying,
"I know, my son, I know. . . ." (48:8-14; 17-19).
The whole scene is focused on the theme of vision. Jacob sees Joseph's
sons and, enigmatically, does not recognize them. Rashi comments that
inspiration, the creative seeing that is Jacob's restored treasure, abandons
him, because evil kings will descend from these two grandsons. An
alienation settles on him, and Joseph hastens to assure him that they are
the offspring of a true marriage. Inspiration returns; but, the text  
continues, Jacob is physically blind. Yet, as he kisses and embraces the two, he
speaks of the wonder of vision: "God has let me see your children."
Joseph then sets his sons in proper order by Jacob's right and left
hands; but Jacob, acting apparently on the disability the text has just
mentioned, crosses [sikel] his hands, and blesses them with the wrong
hand. Joseph sees this and "it was evil in his eyes." He tries to change his
father's hands. But Jacob refuses —va-yima'em once again, as in his
refusal to be comforted after Joseph's presumed death, Jacob says "Nay"
to the words of others, to the version of reality offered him by his son.
This time, however, his "Nay" is expressed with consummate  
confidence: "I know, my son, I know."
The drama of this confrontation between Jacob and Joseph has many
dimensions. In it, the whole story of blindness and perception from
Isaac's blessing onward is encapsulated. Now, Jacob is the blind one,
knowing in his sightlessness. The would-be deceiver of the past knows
that his father was never deceived. With the confidence of that  
knowledge, filled with the same kind of perception as gave him that original

The Pit and the Rope
349
blessing at his father's hands, Jacob can speak not only of knowledge
("I know"), but of seeing ("God has let me see your children"). This is a
vision informed by love and imagination; clouded by evil; restored by a
sense of possibilities.
He sees something in the boys that leads him to cross his hands. The
word sikel (translated here, "he crossed") is translated simply and  
powerfully by Rashi and the Targum: "he guided his hands with understanding
and wisdom [sekhel\. He was aware that Manasseh was the firstborn, and
nevertheless he did not place his right hand on him" (48:14). On this
reading, Jacob, in the very act of crossing his hands, is moved by a total
cognitive understanding of reality. His eyes are physically dimmed, but
his mind and other senses are preternaturally alert; just because he knows
Manasseh is the firstborn, he assumes that Joseph has placed him at his
right hand, and therefore he crosses his hands.69
A subtly different reading is given by Seforno: "Sikel: he knew and
understood through the touch of his hand, without seeing." Jacob's
hands are credited with wisdom; like Isaac, in his blindness, Jacob uses his
other senses, his body, as avenues of knowledge.
The difference between the two readings is perhaps a matter of
emphasis: Rashi maintains that Jacob is fully conscious of what he is
doing in changing his hands, while Seforno writes of an intuitive body-
knowledge. Wherever the source of Jacob's awareness, however, the
outcome is clear, in his serenely repeated answer to Joseph's protest: "I
know, my son, I know." Jacob is fully at peace with his closed eyes and his
full understanding.
He goes on to speak specifically of the relative greatness of the two
boys and of their descendants. He seems to offer reassurance to Joseph, in
his firm assessments of younger and older, great and small. He allays
Joseph's anxiety about delusion—does his father not realize who is the
elder grandson? or does he think Joseph has misarranged his sons, using
his own right hand to place the firstborn? does he underestimate Joseph's
own foresight, or spatial intelligence?
"I know, my son, I know" answers many specific, unspoken anxieties;
but its resonance seems to transcend such specifics. It has a vatic quality,
seeming to imply, in its repetition, a knowledge beyond the empirical. It
contains and grounds Joseph's most radical anxieties, about favoritism,
displacements of firstborn children, and the violence that can unleash.
And it evokes Jacob's own most radical experience of firstborns displaced,

350
VA-YIGGASH
of deception and error in the context of blessing. An intimate and
ultimate sense of order radiates from these words, a patriarchal  
confidence that includes and transcends his own father's affirmation: "And
indeed blessed he shall be!" (27:33).
Joseph andjudab: the conflict of vocabularies
Joseph, however, remains in the world of the sons, after his father has
received his inspired vision and blessing. When the fathers have receded
into metaphysical certainty, each standing firmly by his own form of
knowledge, the sons are left to struggle with the dilemmas, the irritations
of vision. "When Joseph saw . . . it was evil in his eyes" (48:17). Joseph's
irritable confidence in the truth of his perceptions — "Not so, Father" — is
countered by the calm conviction of his dying father. There is a moment
of archetypal confrontation, between the world of the fathers and the
world of the sons. From this point of view, Joseph never graduates to the
status of "father," of patriarch. He is the first of the sons; he has not the
gift of inspiration, but must struggle with his own experience of vision, to
the end believing in the evidence of his eyes.
This is to say that Joseph remains Joseph, seeking for what is certain.
"Lo ken" he says to his father, "It is not so." The same emphasis on the
absolutely proved, on a solid, well-based Tightness, had informed his
challenge to his brothers; he had picked up on their word, as they
protested their innocence of his charge of spying: "No, my lord! ... we
are honest men [kenim]; your servants have never been spies!" (42:10-11).
"If you are honest men [kenim] . . . you must bring me your youngest
brother" (42:19-20).
To be honest, in this sense, is opposed to being a spy, a meragel, a
vagabond, cut loose from social and cognitive proprieties. A meragel is
defined by his visual ambition: he aims to "see the nakedness of the land"
(42:9). It is in response to this specific charge, of an unseemly, disordered
kind of looking at what should not be exposed to the gaze, that the
brothers protest that they are kenim — "honest." Respectable, solidly
defined in their visual projects, the brothers give Joseph what is  
essentially his word—ken. And what it expresses in terms of the desire for clear,
authentic knowledge remains with him even after the central experiment
of his life has been abandoned, even after his father has serenely  
countered his empiricism with vision of a different order.

The Pit and the Rope
351
Between Joseph and Judah remains, then, an unbridgeable space. For
an instant, Judah overwhelmed Joseph with his full, generous use of
language to redescribe himself; with his personal, imaginative vision and
re-vision of his reality. But the union of the two modalities —the Joseph
quest for a "final vocabulary," for metaphysical certainty in the relations
between human beings and reality, and the Judah "ironist" sense of the
contingency of all vocabularies, a sense that only increases his  
responsibility to create a personal vocabulary— is a union of "approachings," of
va-yiggash, in appeasement, prayer, and belligerency. Like the two trees
that are brought close to one another, in EzekiePs prophecy (37:15-
20),70 — the tree of Joseph and the tree of Judah —they will become one
only in some ultimate, messianic time, and in the hand of God. In this
world, the tension between the two remains, a source sometimes of
frustration, sometimes of fruitful confrontation.

VA-YEHI W
The Beginning of Desire
Jacob's deathbed: weakness and power
Thus Israel settled in the country of Egypt, in the region of Goshen;
they acquired holdings in it, and were fertile and increased greatly.
Jacob lived seventeen years in the land of Egypt, so that the span of
Jacob's life came to one hundred and forty-seven years. (47:27-28)
Jacob's final period is described as a time of yeshiva and of hayyim, of
settling down and of living. It is Israel, the man, the family, the nation in
germinal form, that finds a niche (va-ye'ahazu, lit., they were held by it)
in Egypt, this land of essential foreignness. There, paradoxically, they
flourish, realizing all the blessings of fertility. But it is Jacob, the mortal
man, who is described at the opening of the Parsha as "living" in the land
of Egypt, an apparent redundancy that releases unexpected resonances.
For if the English word "lived" is ambiguous, its meanings divide, in
Hebrew, into the two connotations of "settled, resided" and "was alive."
Va-yehi, therefore, carries a peculiarly questioning ring, as if to impress a
meaning of unexpected, almost incongruous vitality. After those many
years of suspended vitality in the darkness of Joseph's absence, Jacob's life
is rediscovered and sustained in the land of Egypt. This is the opening
statement of the Parsha, its virtual redundancy belied by the force of the
word va-yehi, "he lived."
This seventeen-year period of grace culminates in the main subject
matter of the Parsha: Jacob becomes conscious of approaching death, and
communicates his final wishes to his children. In speaking to define a
reality that he is about to leave, Jacob is unique among the patriarchs. His
is, in fact, the only deathbed scene in Genesis, indeed in the whole Torah.
Abraham's death, for instance, is simply narrated after a summary of
his years (25:7-8). As the midrash notices, he conspicuously fails to bless
352

The Beginning of Desire
353
his children: the power of blessing that God had given him1 is  
surrendered, as he senses the complexity encoded within Isaac's being. With
Jacob and Esau as grandchildren, Abraham is simply afraid, in the
language of the midrash, to endorse Isaac by blessing him.2 Isaac's death
is narrated as following on Jacob's return from Padan Aram (35:28-29).
His "deathbed" blessing to Jacob, masquerading as Esau, occurred twenty-
two years earlier. ("And he said, 'I am old now, and I do not know how
soon I may die. . . . So that I may give you my innermost blessing before I
die'" [27:2, 4].) Consciousness of mortality is a feature of Isaac's "in-
scape," but his time of real death arrives without rehearsal and without
declaration of will or blessing.
Jacob is the only patriarch who speaks his will, in full awareness of his
own end. A striking midrashic tradition tells of a new human  
experience—sickness or weakness presaging death.3 Previously, man had died
on a sneeze. Now, Jacob consciously asks for sickness, for a time in which
to prepare, to transact essential death business with his children:4 "Jacob
instituted the sickness that tends toward death."5
The midrashim on this theme cluster around the narrative preamble
tojacob's blessings: "Joseph was told, Tour father is ilF " (48:1). The first
use in the Torah of the word holeh (ill), together with the word hineh
(behold), with its implications of fresh perception,6 form the  
underpinning for a new mode of consciousness. Jacob is aware of his own  
impending death and wants to set his affairs — in the largest sense — in order. An
unprecedented sense of responsibility to life informs Jacob's expression,
on his deathbed, of his "living will."
His first concern is with his own burial. In language of entreaty ("Do
me this favor"), he asks to be buried in Canaan, not in Egypt. Implicit in
his speech are the power relations between an old dying man and his ruler
son, who has "power in his hand to execute his will" (Rashi, 47:29). There
is a pathos in Jacob's insistence on an oath from Joseph, and in his bowing
to his son at the end of the interview. Worldly wise, the midrash  
comments, "The fox in his time, bow down to him" (Rashi, 47:31). Among
the losses of old age is the loss of power. Jacob's primary need has to do
with his own body and its accommodation after death; but with only
words at his disposal, he will use every verbal convention, making Joseph
swear acquiescence, to realize his will.
A provocative midrash, quoted by Rashi (50:6), traces the effects of
this oath on reality. Because of it, Pharaoh is compelled to allow Jacob's
burial in Canaan:

354
VA-YEHI
"According as he made you swear": "Were it not for the oath, I should not
have permitted you to go.'' But Pharaoh was afraid to say, "Transgress
the oath," lest Joseph say, "If so, I shall transgress the oath I swore to
you, that I would not tell about the Holy Language I know in addition
to the seventy languages you know, but which [i.e., Hebrew] you do not
know."
At stake is the strength and weakness of language, its power and
vulnerability. An oath is easily broken, but with it collapses the whole
delicate tissue of transactions and commitments on which society stands.
And ultimately, not to be master of all the languages, especially of the
"seventy-first" language, the ur language, is to be exposed in a shameful
nakedness, a powerlessness, that even a Pharaoh cannot endure. By
making his royal son swear to bury him in Canaan, Jacob evokes the
equivocal authority of words to shape reality.
When Joseph comes a second time to his father in his illness, "Israel
strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed" (48:2); he makes conscious
efforts to greet his princely son with the respect due to his station—even
though, on this occasion, it is Jacob who is about to bestow a gift of
unexpected blessing on Joseph.7
The midrash isolates the motif of brutal and conscious mortality, the
sense of the dying that they are absent from the drama of life, while still
in life:
"Thetime approached'forIsraelto dier'[47:29]. Itis written: "No man has
authority over the lifebreath—to hold back the lifebreath; there is no
authority over the day of death" [Ecclesiastes 8:8]. When Jacob  
inclined toward death, he began to lower himself before Joseph and said,
"If I have found favor in your eyes. . . ." When was this? When he drew
close to death, as it is said, "The time approached for Israel to die."8
There is a strained note of humiliation in Jacob's voice, as this midrash
reads his speech to his son.
Dialecticalry opposed to this, however, is the sense of spiritual power
that clearly emanates from him, as he allocates blessings and destinies to
his children and grandchildren. They wait breathlessly, silently, on his
words. Even Joseph's one protest at the apparent error— as Jacob crosses
his hands over his grandsons' heads (48:14) — is informed by the urgency
of his desire to waste no drop of the precious substance that Jacob is
dispensing. The patriarch is at the center of a force field called "bless-

The Beginning of Desire
355
ing": the position of his hands, the words he articulates, create a reality
that his children regard with great awe, even with trepidation.
Jacob's apparent weakness —generic to the situation of the dying—is
belied, therefore, by a power that rests in words spoken by the dying. The
mythic fascination of deathbeds here—uniquely in the Torah—becomes
central. Here, it is not saintly behavior in the face of death, nor  
meditations at the margin, that mark Jacob's last minutes. Instead, his essential
act is indicated, as he concludes, "When Jacob finished his instructions
[le-tzavot — commanding, charging] to his sons" (49:3 3). He sits up in bed
and "charges" his children. This was the purpose of his self-induced
"illness" — the opportunity to charge, to make some vital contact with the
life he is leaving, to speak words that will help his children to live.9
Dlocked consciousness: the presence of God departs
The problem is one of survival. A deathly darkness falls over Jacob, as he
confronts his family and their future. Egypt is quintessential exile: the
first exile, the paradigm exile. The whole family, in search of bread, has
"gone down" into Egypt—an idiom not merely geographical, indicating
a movement southward, but existential in resonance. Downward is death-
ward. If, to Hamlet, Denmark is a prison, then to Jacob, Egypt is a grave
that threatens to swallow all his family's aspiration for a distinct destiny.10
His last speech is, therefore, "fraught with background," in Erich Auer-
bach's famous phrase:11 in a reality of exile and diffusion, how is the
identity of this family to be preserved?
This identity, that began to be forged in a heroic abandonment of all
known paradigms, in an exquisite training of vision to sights never before
seen, now threatens to end in a peculiar blindness, a failure of the senses
and the sensibilities.
This is the strange burden of Rashi's opening comment on the Parsha.
Responding to the graphic layout of the Torah text at the point of
juncture between Parshat Va-yiggash and Parshat Va-yehi, Rashi asks,
"Why is this Parsha setuma [blocked, closed]?" (47:28). "
By this, he means that there is no space at all, marking the Parsha
break. This is, in fact, the only instance where not even a minimum nine
spaces separate the new Parsha from the previous one. (An "open" Parsha
would leave space to the end of the line and begin on the next line. This is,

356
VA-YEHI
therefore, in the words of Rashi's source, the "most closed of all Parshiot
in the Torah.")12
Rashi's question has all the air of a technical query, but his answer is far
from merely technical: "For when Jacob our father died, the eyes and
hearts of Israel were closed because of the affliction of the bondage with
which the Egyptians began to afflict them. Another explanation: Jacob
desired to reveal the end to his sons, but it was closed [nistam] from him."
He gives two answers to his question, both puns on the concept of the
"blocking" of the text, the loss of intervening space. In the first, the
"blocking" mimes a kind of stupidity that clouds the eyes and hearts of
Jacob's children, as soon as he dies. This is a historical-psychological
observation: slavery brings with it, even in its incipient stages,13 a  
condition in which the victims are diminished in their basic ability to read and
understand their own reality.
The closing of the eyes and heart evokes a midrashic expression used of
the Greeks: "they darkened the eyes of Israel."14 Light or darkness in the
eyes is a metaphor for understanding, intellectual or spiritual. Similarly,
Isaiah decries a nation, whose "eyes are besmeared, and they see not;
their minds, and they cannot think" (44:18). The parallelism indicates
the connection between eyes and heart/mind, seeing and understanding.
Idioms of "light in the eyes" are common in the Talmud: "the elders
illuminate the eyes of Israel"; Mordecai was named "ben Yair," because
he "illuminated the eyes of Israel";15 and in the liturgy, "illuminate our
eyes in Your Torah, open our hearts in Your commandments."16
The closing of intellectual apertures on Jacob's death becomes, on one
reading in the Zohar, independent of the question of slavery.17 R. Yaakov
makes no mention of slavery, simply connecting Jacob's death with the
blocking of understanding. A heavy mystery lies over so unexplained a
statement. There seems to be a fatality at work, less rational than specific
factors of slavery and physical suffering. In itself, Jacob's death brings
in its wake a failure to read reality as though it constituted an  
intelligible text.
The problem with this first of Rashi's answers to the blocked Parsha
question is that at the beginning of the Parsha, Jacob is alive; the whole
Parsha, in fact, as we have noticed, is named for his "aliveness"—va-yehi.
And for most of the Parsha, he remains alive, conscious of approaching
death, trying to assure life to his children. What relevance, then, does the
sealed Parsha break have to his situation? Its symbolism would possibly be

The Beginning of Desire
357
more evocative if the blocking happened in the next Parsha break, after
Jacob's death.
Rashi's second answer comes as a partial response; it moves into
Jacob's own consciousness. It is he who is blocked in his desire to "reveal
the end." The tragic experience of blocking is now his; intimately, he
knows, in the last hours of his life, that condition which will, after his
death, be the fate of his survivors.
"Jacob wanted to reveal the end." This is the moment when Jacob calls
his children around his deathbed and proclaims his intent to speak to
them of the "last things": "And Jacob called his sons and said, 'Come
together that I may tell you what is to befall you at the end of days.
Assemble and hearken, O sons of Jacob; Hearken to Israel your father'"
(49:1-2).
What follows is a description of each son, with no eschatological
reference. It is this discontinuity between Jacob's preamble and the
content of his final speech that generates the midrashic narrative. Rashi
here quotes the midrash again: "He sought to reveal the end, and the
Presence of God departed from him, and he began to say other things."
The whole deathbed speech is, it seems, a diversion from Jacob's
original intent. It bears at best an oblique relation to the final meanings
that Jacob would have wished to communicate to his children. The
"other things" that he finds himself telling his children are quite  
different from the "final things" he had projected — "what is to befall you at
the end of days."
By this expression, Jacob refers to scenarios unfolded in later  
prophetic books, of ultimate redemption, of return from exile, of messianic
harmony and coherence.18 Jacob is the first to refer to this historic, or
perhaps metahistoric, theme, to the "sense of an ending,"19 that shall
make intelligible all the complexities and contingencies of experience.
But the midrash narrates a drama of vision and frustrated speech: "the
Presence of God departed from him"; "it was blocked from him." Is he
prevented from seeing that vision of "the end," or from speaking it? Is it
the eyes or the mouth that strain against their seal?20 What is it to have
the Presence of God depart from one, on one's deathbed?
SefatEmet makes a powerful suggestion:21 to "reveal the end" is simply
to communicate the idea of ultimate harmony. It is not a matter of graphic
descriptions of the manner and the timing of redemption. It is to  
convince Jacob's children, on the verge of exile and diffusion, about to lose all

358
VA-YEHI
sense of autonomy, of the intelligibility of their destiny, that their  
experience really does have a ketz> an implicit order, a movement toward
meaning.
A certain vitality of vision is given to Jacob — and then blocked off from
him. For if Jacob had succeeded in conveying to his children a strong,
unequivocal vision of "the end," the experience of exile would have been
entirely robbed of its necessary sting. That experience knows of no easy
resolution. Jacob's children will have to live its absurdity and its pain, its
apparently fruitless yearnings, without intoxicating visions of harmony to
sustain them. What resolutions, what orderings they achieve, they will
have to achieve in the immediacy, the vulnerability, the confusion of their
own lives.
On such a view, Jacob has a vision that in its very luminousness
prevents him from speaking it. This notion is conveyed in the midrash in
Bereshit Rabbah:
This is like the king's friend, who was about to depart the world, and his
children were gathered round his bed. He said to them, "Come, I shall
reveal to you the secrets of the king." He raised his eyes and saw the
king. Then he told them, "Beware of the glory of the king." So Jacob
our father raised his eyes and saw the Presence of God standing over
him. He told them, "Beware of the glory of God." (98:3)
In place of the "secrets" that the king's friend would have revealed
(liberating, resolving the imprisoned meanings of their condition), he can
only—overwhelmed by the king's presence —stammer his silence and
acquiescence. The paradox is poignant: the end is "blocked," "covered"
by too dazzling a vision. The departure of the Shekhina becomes the
looming Presence {al gabav) that opens his eyes to their widest extent
(talah einav) and seals his mouth.
One implication of the paradox, however, is that his children do, from
his very silence, receive an oblique sense of the king's presence. This is
not an immediate, "usable" experience, as revealed secrets are "usable."
But, obliquely, the "other things" that Jacob says to his children do
convey a deflected vision. "Everything that Jacob wanted to reveal," says
the Zohar, "he did indeed reveal, in a manner that was both hidden and
revealed."22 Cryptically, in a mode of indirection, Jacob communicates a
vision of blinding, even perilous order: "Beware of the glory of the king."

The Beginning of Desire
359
Jacob's bed: the question of coherence
A radically different understanding of the "departure of the Shekhina"
is given in the Talmud:23
"And Jacob called bis sons and said, 'Come together that I may tell you what is
to befall you. . . . Reuben, you are my first-born. . . /"Jacob wanted to
reveal the end of days to his sons and the Shekhina departed from him.
He said, "Is there perhaps—God forbid—a blemish in my bed? Like
Abraham, from whom Ishmael emerged, and like my father Isaac, from
whom Esau emerged?" His sons said to him, "Hear, Israel, the Lord
our God, the Lord is one." They said, "Just as there is nothing in your
heart but oneness, so there is nothing in our hearts but oneness."
Then, Jacob exclaimed, "Blessed be the name of His kingdom's glory
for ever!"
Here, the sensed "absence of God" generates anxiety in Jacob: "is
there perhaps a blemish in my bed?" The notion of the "blemish in the
bed" refers to the genetic pattern established by his father and  
grandfather, by which one out of two children, products of the bed, is "waste
matter" in the destiny of the family— excrescence, "matter out of place,"
in Mary Douglas's famous definition of impurity.24
Jacob —so much more prolific than they, with an expansive vitality
expressed in thirteen children—is concerned with the question of  
coherence. His terror is precisely a terror of the wasted, the excess, the
unusable. The ultimate compliment that is paid him in midrashic rhetoric—
"His bed was whole, complete" —comes to symbolize a life fully used,
energies fully metabolized, its parts tending toward integral meaning.
But the compliment carries with it an undertow of anxiety: on his
deathbed, Jacob is still unsure about the project of his life. Shakespeare's
bitter line on a sexuality felt to have issued forth in meaninglessness —
"Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame"25 — expresses perhaps some of
Jacob's dread. This is a moment in which the readability of his life is in
question; it is called a moment in which the Shekhina departs.
The poignancy of the moment is underscored by his sons' response.
They cannot prove to their father that they all belong to the family
destiny. All they can do is speak back to him—counterpointing his
address, "Hear, O sons of Jacob" — with their own claim to the creation of
meaning in language: Shema Yisrael— "Listen, father, for we, too, must

360
VA-YEHI
speak . . . with all our diversity, our extreme differences and conflicts, we
too are concerned with the question of coherence." In a moment of
vindication, Jacob says aloud, in the mode accessible only in rare times of
unitary vision: "Blessed be the name of His kingdom's glory for ever!"
The striking character of the midrash lies in its dialectical tension. It is
the father's anxious sense of pesul, of anarchy, of meaninglessness, that
generates an affirmation of equivalent concern from the children. That,
in turn, leads the father into an articulation of blessing and integration.
The absence of the Shekhina, that is, evokes a new sense of presence; the
dread of chaos a new sense of order.
Jacob "blocked," suddenly unable to see or speak, becomes a  
premonitory figure, telling of the opaqueness, the confusions of exile. Before the
startled eyes of his children, he enacts a drama of disintegration and
oblique reintegration, that speaks volumes about their own destiny.
The absence of God: the poetic blank
The pathos of this drama is illumined by the fact that, as the midrash
reads Jacob's life, it is no new phenomenon. For long periods, he has
suffered the "absence of the Shekhina." The twenty years inPadan Aram,
in the course of which he amassed wives, children, servants, cattle, sheep,
gold, and silver, are years in which "the Presence of God does not rest on
him."26 In some radical sense that has to do with the effect of Laban's
society, God is not "with him." Then, again, during the twenty-two years
of Joseph's disappearance, "the Shekhina departed from him"; his life
force is drained and wells up again only on the news of Joseph's survival:
"the spirit of Jacob revived."27
These long periods of God's absence are, then, a leitmotif in Jacob's
life. Rambam offers a clinical psychological diagnosis:
Because of Jacob's sorrow and anxiety, during all the days of his
mourning for Joseph, the holy spirit departed from him, until he was
brought tidings that Joseph was alive: then, "the spirit of Jacob  
revived"—which the Targum translates, "The spirit of prophecy rested
upon their father Jacob." The Sages make the point in this way:  
"Prophecy does not come to rest in the midst of lethargy, or of  
melancholy . . . but only in the midst of joy."28

The Beginning of Desire
361
Jacob's condition becomes a paradigm for that joyless condition in
which prophetic vision cannot flourish. Writing as a clinician, Rambam
diagnoses the absence of God as a function of depression ("lethargy and
melancholy,,). In this condition, it is impossible to attain full human
stature; the prophet, in Rambam's view, is the fully developed human
being.
Jacob survives long periods of this "absence of God," to win seventeen
years of grace, of "life" in Egypt. And then, like the flickering of a candle,
at the moment when he most needs prophetic inspiration, it fails him.
Twice in these last hours — once with all his children around his bed, and
once before, as he is about to give special blessing to Joseph's two
children, Ephraim and Manasseh — the midrash recounts this failure. In
Rambam's reading, this is no arbitrary movement of God, present and
then absent, but a movement within the intimacies of Jacob's spirit.
There, something flickers and goes out.
This recurrent experience of a kind of extinction is, I suggest, related
to the trope that Harold Bloom describes in The Breaking of the Vessels—
the trope of the blank.29 This may be taken as a model for the specific
poetic crisis that Jacob endures in his last hours. The blank is a figure that
Bloom traces through poets from Milton to Wallace Stevens. Obviously
derived from the French, "blanc," "white," it is also —paradoxically—
related to the word "black": both black and blank have the same root,
bhel, "to shine or flash." To be assailed by the blank is to be assailed by
emptiness or density, unintelligible, like an unreadable page:
It is difficult to read. The page is dark.
Yet he knows what it is that he expects.
The page is blank or a frame without a glass
Or a glass that is empty when he looks.
— Wallace Stevens,
Phosphor Reading by His Own Light
The tradition of the blank that Bloom uses as an example of transump-
tive literary criticism—"instances of the interpretive and revisionary
power of a poetry perpetually battling its own belatedness" — goes back to
Milton's Paradise Lost:

362
VA-YEHI
Thus with the year
Seasons return; but not to me returns
Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,
Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
But cloud instead, and ever-during dark
Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men
Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair
Presented with a universal blank
Of Nature's works to me expunged and razed,
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.
(Book 3, 40-50)
The sense of being "cut off," "shut out," from wisdom, from an
intelligible vision of things is the pain of a "universal blank." Milton's
physical blindness provides the trope that Coleridge then takes up:
0 Lady! in this wan and heartless mood,
To other thoughts by yonder throsde wooed,
All this long eve, so balmy and serene
Have I been gazing on the western sky,
And its peculiar tint of yellow green:
And still I gaze—and with how blank an eye!
(Dejection: An Ode)
1 see them all, so excellently fair,
I see, not feel, how beautiful they are!
(The Ancient Mariner)
and Wordsworth, describing the "void of decreation:"
Blank misgivings of a Creature
Moving about in worlds not realized
(Intimations of Immortality)
or, in Tintern Abbey, bemoaning his "blind man's eye," and Emerson:
The problem of restoring to the world original and eternal beauty is
solved by the redemption of the soul. The ruin or the blank that we see
when we look at nature is in our own eye. . . .

The Beginning of Desire
363
and the harsh despair of Wallace Stevens:
Shall a man go barefoot
Blinking and blank?
(The American Sublime)
The blank is in the eye of the beholder, but no mere chiding will
transform the unmeaning colorlessness/blackness of things. This is the
poetic crisis, as Bloom isolates it: "the mere horror of blank naught-at-
all" (Coleridge, Limbo). It is this trope, I suggest, that will help us
translate the "departure of God" in the midrashic narrative of Jacob's
last hours. The anxiety of the "blemish in the bed" reduces Jacob's life
to "blank naught-at-all," a parody life, deprived of that "shaping spirit
of Imagination" (Dejection), that envisages and speaks meaning.
When Jacob comes to bless his children, he calls them to "gather
round," to "come together" (he'asfu, hikavtzu). There is a tension in
dealing with their disparateness: he would weld them into a core unity
that will make prophecy possible. But the poetic crisis overwhelms him:
the sheer blackness, the diverse detail and difference of his children
congests his vision. There is no space for structurings, not even the
minimum nine letters' space that allows Parshiot to mean. So that when
he does begin to speak to his massed children, it is without the clear vision
of blessedness that should inform a blessing.
This passage is not prefaced by the word "blessing," since he did not
yet have clearly in focus what he would say to them. Moses, however,
began immediately with the words, "And this is the blessing." The
word "this" [ve-zot] indicates that everything was clearly focused for
him, at the moment he began to speak. In Jacob's speech, on the other
hand, the word "this" is not used, till after all the blessings have been
uttered. Only then, after everything had acquired clear focus for him,
did his blessings seem manifestly to come from God—but not earlier.30
The Ishbitzer, a nineteenth-century hasidic commentator, here  
describes Jacob's confusion as a function of repressed resentment and
suspicion: he is angry with his sons, who put him through the torment of
the Joseph story. This anger is reflected in harsh words to the first three
sons, Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, who are traditionally understood to
have played the most active roles in the deception of Jacob. Only gradu-

364
VA-YEHI
ally, in the course of utterance, he finds himself able to "see" his subject,
through the blur, the blank of his disenchantment. By the time he has
finished, the "poetic crisis" is long over, signaled by the use of the word
"this": "All these were the tribes of Israel, twelve in number, and this [ve-
zot] is what their father said to them, blessing them each according to his
own blessing he blessed them" (49:28).
The poetic crisis resolved
Ample reference to blessing is the harvest of his poem, though it was not
its seed. And what had begun as eileh — 2s a diffuse mass, a blurred
indistinctness—becomes "this" —a firm object of perception. The  
prolific issue of his bed becomes coherent: he blesses each son separately,
but, as Rashi notices, he blesses them all with the blessings of all. A kind of
benign seepage of color replaces the original dry blankness. Even the
sons he most resents from the Joseph episode are suffused by the newly
organic conception he now has of his family:
"Every part of you is fair, my darling" [Song of Songs 4:7]: this speaks
of the tribes. And if you object, "When Jacob blessed the tribes, he
criticized Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, so how can you say, 'Every part of
you is fair'?". . . Nevertheless, he did go back and bless them, as it is
written, "All these were the tribes of Israel, twelve in number." What
is the meaning of "And this is what their father said to them,  
blessing them"? Said R. Elazar, "He made them [lit.] nurse from one
another."31
The fluid, vital quality of his children affects Jacob's vision, so that
what had seemed diffuse and dry now comes together in fluent  
blessedness. This happens in the course of his poem—inspiration arrives  
belatedly, unexpectedly, with imagery of liquids, and of animals.
The associations of fluidity are rich in sensuousness and in their
paradoxical philosophical implications. The fluids that interfuse the
poem begin with the negative connotations of water. This is the simile for
Reuben: "Unstable as water, you shall excel no longer" (49:4). Hasty,
rash, volatile, Reuben cannot dominate his family, cannot be the force
that will bind them into a significant structure. The water image suggests
that he has no self-possession.

The Beginning of Desire
365
But water is then replaced by wine and milk, when Jacob comes to
speak of Judah:
He tethers his ass to a vine,
His ass's foal to a choice vine;
He washes his garment in wine,
His robe in blood of grapes.
His eyes are dark from wine;
His teeth are white from milk.
(49:11-12)
These are sensuous images of eyes and teeth colored by the abundance of
fermenting wine and nurturing milk. Finally, Joseph is also described in
water images ("A wild ass by a spring" [49:22]) and blessed with "the
blessings of the deep that couches below" (49:25) —the symbol of female
sexuality and fertility, moistness, and receptivity. Water, connoting  
impulse, sexuality, release, is now not a negative image, but a figure for
erotic and procreative force.
Fluidity comes to express motion, energy, and fertile receptivity. It is
as though Jacob, in the course of speaking, revises his view of the
passionate and the sensual—the currents in his family that had caused
pain and disruption in the past, and that—as the Ishbitzer suggests—
generate a poetic crisis in Jacob, as he comes to bless his children.
Searching for clear focus, he discovers a new way of seeing fluidity:
ultimately, these passionate connections among his children are the stuff
of life itself. In the form of anger and jealousy, they destroy, but when the
midrash describes Jacob's ultimate blessing of his sons, it is to transform
them into the mode of "nursing from one another" (Pesikta Rabbati).
They nurture one another: the suckling image is a startlingly direct
expression of a vital, even a subconscious drawing on one another's being.
This revision of Jacob's use of fluid imagery is profoundly connected
to the question of integration that so troubles him. The sense that God
has departed from him, the vision of things as falling apart, is, on a tactile
level, an experience of dryness: of discrete parts, without possibility of
attachment or relation.
EzekiePs vision of the dry bones, for example, is essentially a vision of
despair of this kind; from the outset, it is the dryness of the bones that is
emphasized. "He led me all around them; there were very many of them
spread over the valley, and they were very dry" (37:2). These two fea-

366
VA-YEHI
tures—many and dry—convey a landscape of total fragmentation, as
though the entire world had fallen apart into its basic constituents, never
again to be reconstructed.
Dryness is precisely what makes renewed life impossible; here,  
nothing flows, nothing streams. God's question to Ezekiel is almost humili-
atingly rhetorical: "Can these bones live again?" And the prophet's
response is nothing more than a silent acquiescence: "I replied, 'O Lord
God, only You know'" (37:3). When God translates the vision into
contemporary terms, He refers to the dry bones as a mode of  
consciousness equivalent to total despair: "And He said to me, *0 mortal, these
bones are the whole House of Israel. They say, "Our bones are dried up,
our hope is gone; we are doomed"'" (37:11). The bones suggest not
merely death but a desiccation of some vital stuff, for lack of which the
bones lie in stark objective isolation. In this dry condition, there can be
no hope;
We had come to the end of the imagination,
Inanimate in an inert savoir.
— Wallace Stevens,
"The Plain Sense of Things"
Imagination, ways of constructing parts into new wholes, intimate
joinings and fruitions—these are the meaning of God's final promise.
After all the bodies have been reconstructed, bones reassembled, sinews,
flesh, skin, after breath is restored — "You shall know that I am the Lord"
(37:6). The final stage of a knowledge that is not merely an "inert savoir,"
not an expression of a "mind of winter,"32 is what makes hope possible.
Beyond the humiliating blankness of "Lord God, only You know," it
is a mode of dynamic, desirous connection with a world of infinite
possibilities.
This is God's promise; but in the vision of the reconstructed bones,
the promise is not realized. The first stage of resurrection is the wind, the
spirit entering the bodies—"and they came to life and stood up on their
feet, a vast multitude [hayilgadol me 'od me *od]" (37:10). The imagery is of
vast numbers—me 'od me 'od, very very many, as compared with the strewn
bones that were merely rabbot me'od, very many (37:2). But there is no
description of transformed consciousness, of motion. The host of  
reconstructed bodies stands with a fearsome rudimentary force, uninspired,

The Beginning of Desire
367
almost robotlike. The despair of the House of Israel is not, therefore,
assuaged.
Only when God speaks, sending a direct message to the people, does
the wordyediah, knowledge, recur. Twice, God says, "And you shall know
that I am the Lord"; suffusing all the miraculous mechanics of  
reconstituted bodies, lungs filled with air, restoration to the Holy Land, is the
ultimate gift of consciousness, connecting language and reality, narrating
a story of transformation (37:13-14).
Within EzekiePs vision, the possibility of full redemption from the
"dry bones" condition remains a matter of hope: "You shall know that I
am the Lord." Indeed, such an experience of passionate transformation is
the radical desire of prophets and poets: a fluidity of becoming that
represents the very pulse of life:
Will transformation. Oh be inspired for the flame
in which a Thing disappears and bursts into something else;
the spirit of re-creation which masters this earthly form
loves most the pivoting point where you are no longer yourself.
What tightens into survival is already inert;
how safe is it really in its inconspicuous gray?
From far off a far greater hardness warns what is hard,
and the absent hammer is lifted high!
He who pours himself out like a stream is acknowledged at last by
Knowledge;
and she leads him enchanted through the harmonious country
that finishes often with starting, and with ending begins.33
Even Plato—who in his early dialogues had set the claims to genuine
understanding of the philosopher, with his self-possessed good sense, far
above those of the poet—came, in Phaedrus, to reassess his earlier  
position. Martha Nussbaum discusses this movement, from an ideal of self-
possession (sophrosune) to a reappreciation of the virtues of ?naniay erotic
appetite and passionate inspiration. In Phaedrusy Plato uses imagery of
streaming, melting warmth, the flood of passion, the release of  
imprisoned waters, the growth of the soul's wings, which captures the
"feeling of being in a state of mania. . . . The very madness criticized
[previously by Plato] can be an important, even a necessary part of moral
and philosophical development."34

368
VA-YEHI
This movement from self-possession to a more complex, inspired, and
receptive vision of things is, I would suggest, relevant to the process that
brings Jacob from a discrete, "mind of winter" view of his children to one
that allows him to see them as flowing, feeding ("nursing") one another,
growing, passionate, and capable of transformations.
The imagery of water, wine, and milk expresses this movement, as
does the persistent animal imagery. Judah is a lion, Issachar a donkey,
Dan a serpent, Naftali a hind, Joseph an ox, Benjamin a wolf. Most
obviously, these metaphors exude vitality: the very word for animal is
haya, its root meaning "life," as, indeed, does the Latin root of the
English word, "animal." The life force that Jacob senses in his sons is a
capacity—the basic animal capacity—to procreate further life. Jacob's
vision of his family as animals conveys a primal creative energy.
Rashi quotes from the Talmud,35 referring to this animal imagery to
explain the claim of the midwives, as they justify their failure to kill
Israelite male babies (Exodus 1:19): " ''The Hebrew women are not like the
Egyptian women: they are vigorous [hayot\: They are compared to animals of
the field, which need no midwives. And where are they compared to
animals? — 'a young lion/ 'a preying wolf.'"
The basic definition of an animal, a haya, is that it can deal unaided
with the life-business of procreation. Jacob sees in his children a similar
vital competence to realize in the world what is potential within them, to
tend to sustaining and increasing life.
As animal visions of this kind succeed one another, Jacob's conviction
of blessing, of a significant creativity in his family, becomes more  
focused; until, at the end, he is able to vindicate the integrity of his own bed,
in the word ve-zot— "this." It is a lucid focus gained, paradoxically,
through the medium of the "other things," the "other words," that he
has had to speak, in the "blank cold" of his poetic crisis. These words of a
deflected purpose, the products of a failure, a forgetting, a blurring of
focus, lead him by indirection, by the organic flow of their imagery, their
contingency, to a blessing inconceivable at first.
Jacob blesses bis Egyptian grandsons: "They are mine"
The poetic crisis, the experience of the "blank," is, then, the model for
our understanding of the theme of "blocking," of the "absence of God,"
that is so pervasive in midrashic readings of Jacob's deathbed words. A

The Beginning of Desire
369
similar midrashic narrative attaches to that earlier scene where Jacob
gives a special blessing to Joseph's children, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Here, however, the tension of the sudden "blank" is more extreme and,
on the face of it, inexplicable.
In slow motion, the Torah tells of Joseph bringing his two sons to his
father, of Jacob struggling to sit up to greet and bless his beloved son. If
there is any doubt as to the purpose of Joseph's visit, Rashi spells it out: he
brings his sons "so that Jacob may bless them before his death" (48:1).
Within the narrative gap, the silence about Joseph's purpose, the midrash
detects an undertow of anxiety: "'My sons were born in Egypt—will
Jacob bless them nevertheless?' Therefore, when he went to his father, he
took his two sons with him."36 In another midrash, Osnat, his wife, urges
Joseph to take their children to their grandfather, because "I have heard
that if one receives a blessing from a righteous person, it is like receiving
it from the Shekhina."37 What emerges from these midrashic narratives
is the anxiety of diffusion: the sons born in exile, the question of the
coherence of the family, the need for a reaffirmation of the "presence of
God."
Jacob begins his speech by referring to the past, to God's blessing of
him at Luz (Beth-El) (48:3-4). This mode of beginning a blessing is a
way of asserting stability: Jacob is not doing anything rash or unfounded
when he declares, as he does in the next verse (48:5), that he is adopting
his grandchildren as his own children.38 He is simply decoding the
enigmatic phrase in God's blessing: "I will make you fertile and  
numerous, making of you a community of peoples"
This last phrase, as Rashi points out, refers to the expression that God
had actually used: "A nation, yea a community of nations, shall descend
from you" (35:11). Decoding precisely, therefore, Jacob understands that
the "nation" meant Benjamin, the one son still unborn on Jacob's return
to Canaan. But the "community of nations" constitutes a mystery  
unsolved till this day of Jacob's death; for Jacob had no more children, and at
least two more seem to be promised in this phrase. Therefore, he
concludes, this must refer to a "splitting" of one of his tribes — a doubling
of rights and blessings for one of his sons; this gift he now bestows on
Joseph: "Now, your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt
before I came you in Egypt, shall be mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall
be mine no less than Reuben and Simeon" (48:5).

370
VA-YEHI
"Now" conveys Jacob's intention to interpret God's promise as  
applying to his two grandsons. There is a sense of embarking on a new project:
in adopting Ephraim and Manasseh, he includes both Egyptian-born
children—the first fruits of exile and fragmentation, of an "otherness"
that might indeed invite questions about the "integrity of his bed" —
within the "envelope" of his own identity.
These are the children of separation and forgetting (Manasseh is so
named because "God has made me forget completely my hardship and
my parental home," and Ephraim because "God has made me fertile in
the land of my affliction" [41:51-52]). Jacob re-members them into the
structure of promise and blessing on the most intimate level.
For his core statement is // hem . . . yiheyu //—"they shall be mine"
(lit., to me). The dative form for possession is, as we have seen,39 the
characteristic stamp of Jacob's being in the world. He, alone among the
patriarchs, is described everywhere as acquiring property—cattle, sheep,
servants, but also wives and children—a thickening envelope of things
and people belonging to him, attached to him—indicated by the simple
idiom va-yehilo—"they were to him." This "envelope" is an index to his
vitality, his control over an ever more complicated reality. It is a  
fulfillment of God's promise: "You shall spread out [u-faratzta] to the west and
to the east, to the north and to the south" (28:14). "So the man grew
exceedingly prosperous [va-yifrotz . . . me'odme'od— lit., spread out very,
very much] and came to own [va-yehi lo — lit., there were to him] large
flocks, maidservants and menservants, camels and asses" (30:43).
are these?"—the poetic crisis
By the work of his hands, he has realized his own power, economically,
sexually. And now, again using his hands to contain and to bless, he speaks
the same idiom with almost primitive passion: It hem—"they are mine."
What had seemed to spin off into the alien deathworld of Egypt—foreign
grandchildren, born in oblivion—he adopts as integral parts of his own
wholeness.
What follows is all the more enigmatic. There is, first, a strange
reference, apparently unconnected to this adoption project, to the death
of Rachel: "I . . . when I was returning from Padan, Rachel died, to my
sorrow [lit., upon me], while I was journeying in the land of Canaan,

The Beginning of Desire
371
when still some distance short of Ephrath; and I buried her there on the
road to Ephrath (now Bethlehem),, (48:7).
That haunting, intrusive first person—"I . . . died upon me" betrays
a profound trace of feeling, an involvement with the radical question of
his own life. It is poised against the kkhayiheyu — "they shall be yours" of
the previous verse: Joseph's later children will be his own—but "as for
me. . . . she died on, for me. . . ." What is the suppressed narrative that
links these verses ("they are mine. ... as for me. . . . she died for, on
me. . . .")? About to bless his grandchildren as his own children, Jacob is
apparently caught up in a ground swell of emotion that is ultimately—
and in no crudely narcissistic sense —about himself.
Stranger yet is the following passage: "Noticing Joseph's sons, Israel
asked, 'Who are these?'" On the face of it, this must be one of the most
startling moments in the entire Torah. Jacob has just been declaring his
intent to adopt these children; he turns, sees them, and clearly does not
recognize them. What is the reader to imagine? That he is not familiar
with them, that they have grown beyond recognition, since their last visit,
that they are dressed in Egyptian fashion (as one midrash in fact  
suggests), that he is blind (but this, if it is the crucial factor, should be
narrated here, and not two verses later [v. 10] —instead, the text insists,
"Israel saw the children of Joseph")?40
Midrash Tanhuma heightens the tension of the question: "Did he
really not recognize them? But surely they sat in his presence every day
and occupied themselves with Torah? And now he says, 'Who are these?' —
after they attended him for the seventeen years he was in Egypt, he did
not recognize them?" Then it offers a radical answer: "He sawjereboam
ben Nevat and Ahab ben Omri—idolators, who would descend from
Ephraim; and the holy spirit departed from him."41
According to this midrash, Jacob looks at his grandchildren and sees
evil and alienation engendered by them: kings of misrule and worshipers
of strange gods. His gaze instantly turns blank: "Who are these?"
expresses a rupture, a dryness, an "inert savoir." In this condition, he can
clearly not bless them. A certain kind of vision is essential to blessing as it
is to poetry.42 What he sees throws him into silence.
Rashi subtly alters his Tanhuma source: "He sought to bless them but
the Divine Presence departed from him, because Jereboam and Ahab
were destined to issue from Ephraim and Jehu and his sons from Man-
asseh." In his version, Jacob simply experiences the blank, without seeing

372
VA-YEHI
visions of evil kings. He intends to bless, and knows that God has
departed. His question, "Who are these?,,, refers directly to Ephraim
and Manasseh (and not to the future kings): it expresses his horrified
alienation in the indubitable experience of the moment. What can be the
nature of these children, if such a blank cold suddenly possesses him? The
explanation about the evil kings is offered to the reader but plays no part
in Jacob's consciousness. For him, there is only the unmediated,  
undeniable fact of the blank.
Joseph's reply is then read strongly by Rashi: " 'And Joseph said to his
father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here"' [ba-zeh]: bazeh
indicates that Joseph showed him his document of betrothal and his
marriage contract, and Joseph supplicated for mercy about this. Then,
the holy spirit rested upon him" (48:9). Joseph allays Jacob's anxiety
about "Who are these?" —about the meaningless proliferation of his
life — with the word ba-zeh — "with this": he points to the marriage  
document that testifies to his own intentionality, even in the midst of exile and
oblivion. Zeh is the word that expresses focus, clarity, integrity of vision.
For lack of it, Jacob has been lost in the "waste and welter" of the
unintelligible eileb — "Who are these}" — just as, later, he will be unable to
preface his blessings to his whole family with ve-zot ha-berakha.
Joseph assuages Jacob's anxiety, so that, eventually, Jacob is able to
bless Ephraim and Manasseh. But when, precisely, does inspiration
return? When is the "universal blank" transformed into a readable "book
of knowledge"? Rashi gives one answer: immediately after he has been
shown Joseph's ketuba, his marriage document, Jacob's power to read the
world in the mode of blessing returns: "Bring them up to me, that I may
bless them" (48:9). The crisis, essentially, is over.
There are, however, other, more tortured readings. In Bereshit Rabbati,
for instance, the crisis continues unresolved through the description of
Jacob's blindness, his embraces of his children, till the point where
Joseph withdraws in anguish at his father's anguish and prostrates  
himself: "And Israel said to Joseph, 'I never expected to see you again, and
here God has let me see your children as well.'Joseph then removed them
from his knees, and bowed low with face to the ground" (48:11-12).
In a deliberate misreading, the midrash gives us this prostration, not as
a bow of gratitude to his father for forthcoming blessing, but as a final
desperate —and lonely—entreaty to God to transform Jacob's vision:

The Beginning of Desire
373
"[When you disappeared,] I did not debate in my mind [lopilalti—lit.,
I did not thinky engage in all the resources of thought about you],43 'Is
he alive or dead?' But I cut off my thinking/hoping [sivri has the double
meaning of rational thought and openness to possibilities] from my
Creator about you. And I said: 'My way is hidden from the Lord'
[Isaiah 40:27]."
When Jacob saw that the Holy Spirit had departed from him, he
began speaking to Joseph: "I think it is because I cut off from God my
thinking/hoping about you that now God does not answer me with
inspiration about your children. ... I have nothing to plead [lit., no
opening of the mouth] to appeal for His mercy. You go out and appeal
for mercy, that the Holy Spirit may rest upon me, to bless your
children." Immediately, Joseph took his children out from between his
knees, and when he saw his father's distress, he took them and fell on
his face before God. . . . And immediately, the word of God leapt [lit.]
upon Jacob.44
In this radical midrash, Jacob assembles the fragments of his own life.
He holds himself culpable of despair: he has closed a certain inner debate,
in which hope might have held open the dialectical possibilities of his
situation. Such hope had carried too high a price. There was a paradoxical
ease in reducing the complexity of the debate to a single thin strand of
despair, in interrupting the exhausting process of thought, the finality of
the blank. Jacob quotes a prooftext from Isaiah: "My way is hidden from
the Lord."45 Essentially, his feeling was that his way was hidden from
himself: it is precisely the experience of the blank, of the too-dense, too-
empty human condition, that baffles him into silence.
Now, again, such a paralyzing silence grips him; but by now, he is
ready to hold himself accountable for despair. Because he cut short a
certain vital inner discourse at that time, he now has no "opening of the
mouth"; a genius for hopeful interpretations has dried at the root. Only
Joseph can save the situation. Separating himself from his father's  
despair, he regains by the passion of his own vision a time of grace for his
father.
What the midrash conveys so wonderfully is a sense of the  
infrastructure of Jacob's spiritual life. Daringly, it evokes a Jacob who thinks
himself accountable for his own blankness in the face of a tormenting
complexity. The deep traces of old feeling about expansiveness and
harmony, contingency and transcendent purpose, underlie this penulti-

374
VA-YEHI
mate moment of poetic crisis. But why—at this least appropriate of
moments— does the sensation of the "universal blank" overwhelm him?
Why—just after so bravely asserting that his Egyptian grandchildren, in
all their apparent otherness, "are mine," are integrated into his vision of
his life —does the center not hold, why do things fall apart?
The memory of Rachel: unity and fragmentation
Jacob's mysterious reference to Rachel's death and burial comes between
Jacob's intention to adopt Ephraim and Manasseh and the moment of
poetic crisis. Here, I would suggest, is the bridge, the thought that
discomposes Jacob to the point of paralysis.
Enigmatically, he pivots the sentence on himself: "As for me. . . . She
died on, for me. . . ." Is this a certain guilt speaking, as Jacob remembers
how he cursed the unknown thief of the Teraphim (31:32)?46 Or how he
delayed fulfilling his vow to return to Beth El, to return to his father, and
assume the authority, the originality of his own being?47 Or is he  
explaining that Rachel's death was, on the level of erotic feeling, a desiccation of
his own faculty for vital feeling (meita alai— "her death was my death")?48
But why does he focus on the place of Rachel's burial — "there, on the way
to Ephrath"?
Rashi quotes a midrash that implicitly resolves all the enigmas:
"And I buried her there": and I did not carry her even to Bethlehem to
bring her into the Land. And I know that you have a complaint in your
heart against me. But know that it was by the word of God that I buried
her there, so that she might be of help to her children: when
Nebuzaradan sends them into exile, they will pass by there, and Rachel
will come out of her grave and weep and entreat God for mercy for
them, as it is said, "A voice is heard in Ramah—wailing, bitter  
weeping— Rachel weeping for her children. She refuses to be comforted for
her children, who are gone. Thus said the Lord: Restrain your voice
from weeping, your eyes from shedding tears; for there is reward for
your labor, says the Lord" (Jeremiah 31:15-16).
In this poignant passage, Jacob feels guilt—projected as Joseph's
resentment49—at burying Rachel so unceremoniously. But this burial
was designed by God, so that in a time of need, centuries later, Rachel
would be strategically placed so as to intercede for her exiled children.

The Beginning of Desire
375
A closer reading of Rashi leaves us uneasy, however, even on the most
factual level. In what sense is it true to say that Jacob did not carry her
body "into the Land"? Was she buried abroad? Clearly, the text describes
her place of burial ("near Ephrath, which is Bethlehem"), and Rashi
himself makes the point that Benjamin was the only one of Jacob's
children to be born within the borders of the Land (35:18). Rachel's death
and burial followed immediately. To "carry her into the Land" may,
therefore, simply indicate a failure to bury her in recognizably holy
land—which, in the time of the Patriarchs, may have meant land legally
purchased by them for burial plots. This suggestion50 reinforces the sense
that Jacob might have acted to create a real place, consciously  
consecrated, to bury his loved wife, rather than simply bury her in a "no place"
{ba-derekh suggests the transitional space between place and place).
It is this "liminality" that Ramban emphasizes, as he scrutinizes the
text for a basis for Rashi's midrashic narrative. That basis he finds in the
word ba-derekh, repeated, signifying a strategic placing on the route her
children would take on their way out to exile. She is buried at the interstice
between holy land and exile. This is not a proper burial at all, as Rashi's
midrashic source makes clear:51 the problem is not that she was buried
apart from Jacob, but that such an unceremonious burial leaves her
exposed, unplaced—and therefore responsive to her children's pain at
their point of dispersal.
Jacob recalls the pain, guilt, and strange promise associated with
Rachel's burial, at the very moment when he is reintegrating the lost
fragments of his life—the two grandchildren of Rachel, born of beauty,
jealousy, hatred, and exile.
But there is a further dimension to what is stirred in him, as he recalls
Rachel's tears for her children. Maharal, in his super-commentary to
Rashi,52 discusses the peculiar prestige of Rachel's tears. What, he asks, is
Rachel's power of intercession? Why does God instruct Jacob to bury her
so that it is her tears that will restore her children from exile? Why does
she cry more than the other mothers of Jacob's children? He refers to
Eikhah RabbahP
Rachel says to God, "What have my children done, that You have
brought such punishment upon them? If it is because of their idolatry
[called tzara, a rival wife] — I loved my husband, Jacob, and he worked
for me for seven years, and in the end my father gave my sister to him in
marriage. And I constrained my love for my husband and handed over

to my sister the identifying signs. ... I am flesh and blood, while You
are the compassionate King— how much more merciful should You be
to them!" And God answers, "There is a reward for your labor."
Rachel's entreaties win God's ear as no other intercession succeeds in
doing (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob try in vain). Maharal understands her
to be speaking of theological issues — monotheism and idolatry, sin and
forgiveness — in terms of her most intimate experience. This is the core of
Maharal's discussion. The story of Jacob and Rachel's love for each other
becomes a paradigm for metaphysical reality:
Rachel knew that there is a rightness in Jacob's marrying two wives, for
this world, which is a world of division and separation, does not lend
itself to total unity. If Jacob had had only the one wife of his desire, the
family and the nation would have been unified, the basic split of the
people into two kingdoms Qudah from Leah, and Ephraim from
Rachel)—a split that will endure till messianic times—would have been
avoided. But because Rachel saw that such a split is congruous with the
nature of this world, she suppressed her love and jealousy. She,  
therefore, is uniquely qualified to plead that God similarly forgive Israel for a
sin—idolatry, the "rival wife" —that is a direct outcome of the  
fragmented reality of this world. She is most personally tutored in the pain
of incompleteness; God listens to the weeping that teaches Him about
the world He has created.
Maharal's assumption is that the personal dramas of the patriarchs and
matriarchs are always indicative of metaphysical reality. Here, he touches
on the classic philosophical problem of the One and the Many, and
proposes a tragic acceptance of this world as one of multiple, conflicting
versions of truth. Without a single indubitable focus, human beings
naturally tend to "other gods," to "rival wives." This, Rachel argues, is in
the very nature of this world, as God made it, and as she has experienced
it, in her most intimate knowledge of "otherness." This is not a world of
perfect love, of pure forms, but rather one of diffracted, partial  
relationships, of kaleidoscopic, shifting appearances. Rachel, passionately in love
with her husband, nevertheless achieves a kind of acquiescence, even a
muted optimism, in her acceptance of the "rival wife."
For Rachel, in Maharal's reading, is poised at the fulcrum of unity and
fragmentation. She personifies total passion—Jacob works for her and
only for her; she is the primary and ultimate symbol of integration, the

The Beginning of Desire
111
dream mother of the Jewish people. It is she, therefore, who suffers the
diffusion and exile of her children, accepting the tragic "rightness" of
such displacements, yet expressing, in that very acquiescence, the most
poignant appeal to the creator of such a world. "If I could tolerate
incompleteness, fragmentation of my desire, why cannot You?" And
God, moved by the human being reinventing the world in the shape of
her own experience, promises reward for her "labor" — hope for ultimate
integrations.
The point is a fine one. Rachel reflects back to God the split reality of
a human being. Exposed, buried in no place (ba-derekh), in the liminal
space in which exile begins, she acts as a potent magnet: the very force of
her yearning will draw her children back toward coherence. In all their
diffusion, they will live with an undertow of desire for oneness. It is this
desire, the eternal yearning that Rachel, buried at the border, will  
restlessly articulate.
Her "labor," her significant act that earns reward, is simply her tears.
God bids her restrain them, but she never will—until "the end," the time
beyond history and its shatterings, when "those who sowed in tears shall
reap in joy" (Psalms 126:5). Till then, she "refuses to be comforted"; a
terrible, disconsolate passion possesses her. Like Jacob mourning for his
lost son Joseph ("He refused to be comforted" [37:35]), she cannot
accept comfort, for that would mean final despair; the lost fragments
would never cohere again.54
Her fierce tears are a response to her children's fate — "who are gone."
Ki einenu—xhey are not, they have "gone from her sight." She longs for
them, strains to see them, and sees only their absence. But like Jacob,
whom Judah painfully records as saying of Joseph, "He is gone from
me. . . . and I have not seen him since" (44:28), Rachel draws  
paradoxical, stubborn hope from this ambiguous notion of einenu. She will not be
comforted, she refuses the simplifications of despair, because her  
children's absence is situated in the refracted, limited perspectives of this
world. The word einenu itself contains skeptical reservations:55 human
perception is partial, subject to constant change in a world of "division
and separation."
Rachel's sense of what "is not" engenders imaginings beyond the
visible: these are the "labor" of her tears.
For there is a reward for your labor—declares the Lord:
They shall return from the enemy's land.

378
VA-YEHI
And there is hope for your future—declares the Lord:
Your children shall return to their country.
God rewards her with "hope" alone; for the passage is circular in its
implications, it comes to no final apotheosis. God may tell her to hold
back her tears; but it is just her refusal to do this, to "be comforted," that
constitutes the work of faith in this world.
In MaharaFs reading, therefore, heroic complexity, a kind of tragic
optimism, radiates from the figure of Rachel, buried "by the way." It is
this painful radiance, I suggest, that overwhelms Jacob's memory, just at
the moment when he is about to synthesize the exiled fragments of his
world. The thought of Rachel becomes a mirror, reflecting, same and yet
inverted, some of his own deepest dilemmas. For, if she could tolerate the
diffractions of her experience, Jacob, it seems, cannot. Rachel can hold a
position at the margin between reality and appearances, on the border
between meaning and meaninglessness. For Jacob, the tension  
underlying such a position is sometimes unbearable. At the very moment of
reintegration, it precipitates him into the blank.
Between meaning and mystery
Robert Alter writes of "the most characteristic moments of biblical
narrative": "The world is seen as offering all sorts of access to human
understanding, but there is also no absolute fit between the nature of
reality and the human mind. The biblical tale is fashioned in ways that
repeatedly remind us of that ontological discrepancy."56
This ontological discrepancy is one meaning of exile. Rachel's sense of
the fragmentary occlusions, limited perspectives, and blind spots of this
world is an extension of the core symbolism of exile. On his deathbed,
Jacob lives the repeated shocks to coherence that his children will  
experience over thousands of years. In most intimate form, he suffers the
blanking of meaning, the poetic crisis, that threatens to seal off language,
as well as vision.
In this peculiar suffering, he serves as paradigm to his children, in
their looming worlds of exile. As Ramban notices, in his opening  
comment to the Parsha, Jacob dying in Egypt is an emblematic figure,
premonitory of those exiles, that will endure much longer than expected:
"And our exile has extended immensely over us, its end is not known, as

The Beginning of Desire
379
the ends of previous exiles were, and we are in it like the dead who say,
'Our bones dried up, we are cut off (Ezekiel 37:ll)."57
Unlike Rachel, however, Jacob's work is not to be the work of tears, but
of words. He must find "other words" to accommodate the plain sense of
things to human need. The disenchantments, the dry incoherencies of
exile are to be the very subject of his poem. "Not to have is the beginning
of desire."58 Between meaning and meaninglessness, he must find the
energy to create a world; for "the words of the world are life of the
world."59
The prophet Amos articulates this idea succinctly: dirshuni vi-heyu—
"Seek Me and live" (5:4). Out of the human response to God's absence,
to the unintelligible and the fragmented, life is generated. Dirshuni,
moreover, means the process of inquiry, interpretation, re-membering,
that creates meaning. Derisha, midrash, is the work of continuing  
translations in the face of mystery.
A story by Italo Calvino will help us realize the abstraction. In  
"Serpents and Skulls," Mr. Palomar is visiting the ruins of Tula, ancient
capital of the Toltecs.
A Mexican friend accompanies him, an impassioned and eloquent
expert on pre-Columbian civilizations, who tells him beautiful legends
about Quetzalcoad. ... In Mexican archeology every statue, every
object, every detail of a bas-relief stands for something that stands for
something else that stands, in turn, for yet another something. . . . Mr.
Palomar's Mexican friend pauses at each stone, transforms it into a
cosmic tale, an allegory, a moral reflection.
A group of schoolchildren moves among the ruins: stocky boys with
the features of the Indios, descendants perhaps of the builders of these
temples, wearing a plain white uniform, like Boy Scouts, with blue
neckerchiefs. The boys are led by a teacher not much taller than they
are and only a little more adult, with the same round, dark, impassive
face. They climb the top steps of the pyramid, stop beneath the
columns, the teacher tells what civilization they belong to, what  
century, what stone they are carved from, then concludes, "We don't know
what they mean," and the group follows him down the steps. At each
step, each figure carved in a relief or on a column, the teacher supplies
some facts and then invariably adds, "We don't know what it means."
. . . Though Mr. Palomar continues to follow the explanation of his
friend acting as guide, he always ends up crossing the path of the
schoolboys and overhearing the teacher's words. He is fascinated by his

380
VA-YEHI
friend's wealth of mythological references: the play of interpretation,
allegorical readings, have always seemed to him a supreme exercise of
the mind. But he feels attracted also by the opposite attitude of the
schoolteacher: what had at first seemed only a brisk lack of interest is
being revealed to him as a scholarly and pedagogical position, a  
methodological choice by this serious and conscientious young man, a rule
from which he will not swerve. . . . The refusal to comprehend more
than what the stones show us is perhaps the only way to evince respect
for their secret; trying to guess is a presumption, a betrayal of that true,
lost meaning.
. . . The boys go by. The teacher says, "This is the wall of the
serpents. Each serpent has a skull in its mouth. We don't know what
they mean."
Mr. Palomar's friend cannot contain himself: "Yes, we do! It's the
continuity of life and death; the serpents are life, the skulls are death.
Life is life because it bears death with it, and death is death because
there is no life without death. ..."
The boys listen, mouths agape, black eyes dazed. Mr. Palomar thinks
that every translation requires another translation and so on. . . . And
yet he knows he could never suppress in himself the need to translate,
to move from one language to another, from concrete figures to
abstract words, to weave and re weave a network of analogies. Not to
interpret is impossible, as refraining from thinking is impossible. Once
the school group has disappeared around a corner, the stubborn voice
of the little teacher resumes: "No es verdad, it is not true, what that senor
said. We don't know what they mean."60
"Not to interpret is impossible, as refraining from thinking is  
impossible." And yet, the imperviousness, the closedness of the fragments
demands a "respect for their secret," for their "true lost meaning."
Exquisitely poised between this respect for what is hidden, the forbidding
blank, and the need to translate, to understand—though provisionally—
that very enigma, Mr. Palomar communicates a radical and all-but-
paralyzing paradox.
Precisely where primary, privileged enlightenments have failed, the
need to translate, to seek meaning through the "other words" of human
discourse, remains the endless project of human life. As in the Mexican
friend's interpretation of the serpents and the skulls, "death is death
because there is no life without death": what is hidden, what has been
repressed, generates an ever-new "gaiety of language."61

The Beginning of Desire
381
Mourning the loss of the "brightness and the gleam," Wordsworth
comes in the end to give thanks precisely for
those obstinate questionings
Of sense and outward things,
Fallings from us, vanishings;
Blank misgivings of a Creature
Moving about in worlds not realized.
(Intimations of Immortality)
The worlds of exile are "not realized," blank, unintelligible, for Jacob,
as they will be for his children. But, insists Amos, in the face of devastation
and exile, dirshuni vi-heyu: "Seek Me, inquire for Me, interrogate Me,
weave networks of meaning about My hidden face." And Jacob,  
containing within himself the infinite tension of life in such worlds not realized,
must utter words that will merge mystery and meaning, and teach his
children to speak themselves toward blessing.

'Be fertile and increase, and fill the earth. The fear and dread of you shall be
upon all the beasts of the earth and upon all the birds of the sky— everything
with which the earth is astir [tirmoss] — and upon all the fish of the sea; they
are given into your hand. . . . Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall
his blood be shed; For in His image, did God make man. Be fertile, then, and
increase; abound [shirtzu] on the earth and increase on it.'" The Rabbis (see
Rashi, 9:6) define this as both a blessing and a commandment—the  
imperative of "apres le deluge." Even the word sheretz, with its specifically reptilian
quality, is now incorporated into the imperative of human fertility. But here,
too, the proliferation motif is set beside the motif of man's godlikeness. 13. Elias Canetti, Crowds and Power (Penguin: 1973), 109. 14. Ibid, 126. 15. Ibid, 128-29. 16.

when Adam is punished: "Cursed be the ground because of you; by toil [be-

unpredictable, willful nature of the earths response to man's curse. Man will be
compelled by necessity to accept the "thorns and thistles,, that the earth will
offer him, after he has invested his best resources in it. This doom is reflected
again later, when Noah is born, and there is new hope for "relief from our
work and for the toil [itz 'von] of our hands, out of the very soil which the Lord
placed under a curse" (5:29). There, again, Rashi reiterates his theme of
itzavon as the frustration of the worker who sows wheat and reaps thorns and
thistles. There, itzavon is clearly associated with the "hands-on" involvement
and risks that are confronted by creativity. 45. Emmanuel Levinas, Nine Talmudic Readings, trans. Annette Arono-

Notes
385 65. The pivotal role of language is stressed by Rashi. God asks,  
redundantly, "Where are you?" only in order that Adam's version of his experience
should not be inhibited by fear. God's desire is to "enter into words with
him." Adam's response is inadequate to the occasion. 66. See the complex image of the cradle, in which man sleeps before
Creation (Bereshit Rabhah 2:3). The earth-nurse watches the cradle with
apprehension (toha u-boha)\ the sleeping infant is contained, at peace, in this
primary reality. But a secondary reality is already implicit: the sleeping child
will awake to his full powers and destroy both himself and the world. 67. Another version of Rashi: On the sixth of Sivan, when Israel received
the Torah, all the works of beginning were strengthened, and it was as if the
world was created then. 68. B. Shabbat 88a. 69. Pesikta Rabbati, 21 (100a). 70. Va-yikra Rabbah 36:4.1 have slightly changed the play on words here,

generous mode of relationship that the sinner is transgressing: instead of  
disinterested concern to marry off his sister, he demonstrates selfish lust.

years before the Flood" (Ba-midbar Rabbab 14:12). 50. Beresbit Rabbab 30:9. 51. Ibid., 31:19. 52. Emmanuel Levinas, Totality and Infinity (Duquesne University Press:
1969), 110-15. 53. Ibid., 116. 54. "The righteous man knows the needs of his beast" has traditionally
been understood to refer to this relation to ones own needs, and their wise
management. 55. Tanhuma, Noah, 9. 56. See Ramban 6:19 57. Beresbit Rabbab 32:4. 58. Ibid, 32:8. 59. Ma'aseh Ha-shem 68:1. See also Targum Onkelos. 60. Bachelard, Poetics of Space, 224 61. See Tanbuma, Noah, 11, and our earlier discussion of this midrash.
This reading is based on the fact that Noah and his sons are listed separately
from their wives, in the original instructions to enter the ark (6:18; 7:7; 7:13),
but in pairs when they are told to leave the ark (8:16) —and, in the same
breath, God tells them of the fertility-imperative implicit in "coming out."
Noah, however, leaves in sexually segregated groups (8:18). 62. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 23. 63. Shakespeare, Hamlet, II, ii, 257. 64. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 23.

Notes
389 65. Baal Ha-Turim suggests that Og is a decoding of the words "Only
Noah," since they have the same numerical value (gematriya). This would
imply an intimate—perhaps dialectical—relation between the Noah who is
enclosed in the ark and the obsessional force of the giant king. 66. Bachelard, Poetics of Space\ 222-23. 67. See Rashi, 8:13, and B. Rosh Hashanah 12b. 68. Beresbit Rabbab 18:1. 69. Ibid., 18:3. 70.

3. It is interesting to notice, however, that the first tin in the Torah (2:5)
   speaks of the absence of Man himself. ("When the Lord God made earth and
   heaven—when no shrub of the field was yet on earth and no grasses of the
   field had yet sprouted, because the Lord God had not sent rain upon the earth
   and there was no man — adam ayin — to till the soil. . . .") Without human
   consciousness of need and desire, without the experience of the "peculiar
   possibility of the negative," there can be no prayer, indeed no reality that is
   humanly appropriated. See Rashi's comment on this passage.

land1: Move even further away from there" —his native land he has already
left with his father: the point now is to move on, away, with no specified
destination. 7. Tanhuma, Lekh Lekha, 3. 8. Y'lamdenu, quoted in Torah Shelemab 12:107. 9. See Rashi on this verse: " 'Therefore shall a man leave\* \ The Holy Spirit
makes this declaration, forbidding incest to all mankind." The incestuous
bond is primary not only chronologically, in the history of the child's  
development, but culturally and spiritually. A primal unity must be ruptured in
order that generation take place—the removal of the rib from Adam's body
becomes in Rashi's comment the paradigm for abenation-become-fruition. 10. Bereshit Rabbah 53:6. 11. Ibid., 39:16. The imagery of coinage suggests the capacity to "mint"
and reproduce, to beget in one's own image. Abraham and Sarah come to
represent a transformative mode that captures the human imagination. 12. Cf. the commentary of Etz Yosef: "Their two situations that are

root letters, is not, I hope, entirely perverse. The state of  
alienation/barrenness (akirah) is one of ground torn away (kri'ah) — filaments of connection
with past and future rent apart. Discontinuity is the essential experience
Abraham comes to represent. 17. Midrash Ha-Gadol 12:1. 18. Cf. Rashi: " 'Lekh lekha': Go from your land — for your good, for your
benefit" (12:1). 19. See the comment of the Netziv on "And Abram went as God had told

them to the sciences.

In his comment on Proverbs 5:19, he cites an Arabic source for the
translation, "preoccupation"; and then adds the rabbinic reading, which
emphasizes "distraction." 43. Cf. Deuteronomy 28:34: "until you are driven mad by what your eyes
behold." And the comment of Haamek Davar. the madness comes not from
physical suffering but from the disruption of normal causal relationships. 44. W. B. Yeats, Easter, 1916. 45. Conversely, language always conspires to close off as it discloses
meaning: "There is also another sense in which we can never quite close our
fists over meaning, which arises from the fact that language is a temporal
process. When I read a sentence, the meaning of it is always somehow
suspended, something deferred or still to come" (Terry Eagleton, Literary
Theory [University of Minnesota Press: 1983], 128). Deferral, writes George
Steiner (Real Presences [University of Chicago Press: 1989], 122) is "that
postponement of settled signification, that keeping in flickering motion
which adjourns the illusion, the sterile fixity of meaning."
Note that Rashi has changed the text of his source in Bereshit Rabbah,
which speaks of a reward for each step, an image obviously more appropriate,
as Abraham sets out on a journey, each step of which is shrouded in doubt.
Perhaps Rashi is thinking primarily of his supporting prooftexts, where
delayed language is an appropriate expression of indeterminacy. The third
example Rashi gives ("on one of the mountains") is his own addition to the
quotations in Bereshit Rabbah: for him, evidently, this theme is central to the
Abraham idea, and it is crucial to consider the three quotations as an organic
structure. 46. E.g., Sifrei Deuteronomy, 326: "When God punishes Israel, He, as it
were, regrets it." J. Nedarim, 9, 41b: "Is not regret of a vow like a novel
[unforeseen] circumstance?" Shemot Rabbah, 43:11: in Moses' prayer of

392
Lekb Lekba
intercession, "Turn back from Your burning anger and think better of the
evil decreed against Your people" (Exodus 32:12), the word for "think
better" (hinnahem) is translated, "Let tehiya exist for You." 47. Cf. B. Shavuot 17a: "When he did not stand still, he walked  
constantly." B. Berakhot 5a: "The pious spend an hour in silent contemplation
before prayer." B. Berakhot 32b: "They would contemplate an hour, pray an
hour, and again contemplate an hour."
Compare George Steiner's discussion of Derrida's "famous neologism,
la difference, [which] is crucial to the deconstnictionist and post-structuralist
counter-theology of absence." Particularly in the sense of "deferral" — "that
postponement of settled signification, that keeping in flickering motion
which adjourns the illusion, the sterile fixity of definition" (Real Presences,
P 122). 48. Cf. B. Yevamot 36b: "A human birth that survived thirty days is not
considered an abortion." 49. The expression is borrowed from John Keats, "On First Looking into
Chapman's Homer" Compare B. Hulin 75b: "Reish Lakish gazed at him
(when R. Yohanan gave his opinion) and was silent." 50. Note that the double cry, "Abraham! Abraham!" as God's angel
reveals himself after the Akedah (22:11) is described by Rashi as "an  
expression of love [biba]" Here, God reciprocates Abraham's love, after the  
suspension in space and time is resolved. 51. Cf. R. D. Laing's clinical description of akarut as peril and  
opportunity:
Something happens that is incompatible with [this] pivotal
identity, perhaps hidden, that determines his whole system of
meaning. A linch-pin is removed that had been holding a whole
world together, The whole meaning of reality crumbles. It
'fakesthe groundfrom under his feet" [my italics]. Participation in
the world, such terms as "contact with" and "sense of reality"
are empty sounds. A desperate crisis indeed. Either one  
restructures one's whole "real" view of others and the world and
redefines one's "real" self; or one annuls the chasm between
what is the case and what one knows to be the case, by taking
one's stand on what one knows. There is nothing more real and
indubitable than pure phantasy; nothing more obvious;  
nothing less necessary and more easy to prove. (Self and Others
[Penguin: 1961], 93) 52. The repeated second-person singular possessive suffix in the lekb
lekba summons—"Go forth from your land, your birthplace, your father's
house" brings an almost hypnotic focus to bear on self. This suggests a
fascination in abandonment.

Notes
393 53. Compare the use Rashi makes of the words terufznA meshugga in his
account of the drowning of the Egyptians. Their self-infatuation gives them a
fatal buoyancy that will not allow them the mercy of a quick death. 54. Frank Kermode, The Genesis of Secrecy (Harvard University Press:
1979), 145. 55. The text discussed in the Talmud is "Today you have become the
people of the Lord" (Deuteronomy 27:9). "Today" suggests a "double
exposure" effect: the day of Moses' speaking, or indeed the day of the reader's
reading, becomes elided with the day of the Giving of the Torah on Sinai. 56. Cf. the comment of Ha'amek Davar on Exodus 19:19. 57. Tanhuma, Miketz, 2. 58. See Rashi on Exodus 6:9, citing B. Sanhedrin Ilia. 59. Bereshit Kabbah, 44:6. 60. Ibid., 57:2. Cf. Rashi on 22:20. The midrash is apparently playing on
the similarity between ahar ha-devarim ha-ekh ("after these things") and
hirburim. 61. Cf. Isaiah 59:13. 62. B. Niddah 16b. 63. It is interesting to notice the "timing" of Abraham's hirburim, in the
midrashic sources—e.g. Bereshit Rabbah 56:12: "Abraham began to wonder:
All these events are bewildering—yesterday You told me, 'In Isaac, seed shall
be named for you'; then You said, 'Please take your son'; and now You tell me,
'Do not stretch out your hand against the boy\* —I am full of wonder!" It is
only after a certain crisis of commitment is past that he opens himself to the
complex contradictions (literally, the counterdictions—mutually exclusive
speech acts) of his situation: characteristically, after these things. Compare
also the version of this midrash in J. Ta'anit 2:4: "Master of the universe, it is
fully revealed to You that at the time that You told me to offer up my son, / had
what to answer You?' The timing of Abraham's musings on contradiction is of
the essence here. "I had a response" indicates the thought that is immediately
submerged in the movement of love for God. Only when he has acted out that
commitment do the full implications of contradiction surge up in his mind.
This is the time for meaning-making. 64. J. Huizinga, Homo Ludens (Routledge and Kegan Paul: 1949), 13.
Huizinga defines play as "a free activity standing quite consciously outside
'ordinary' life as being 'not serious,' but at the same time absorbing the player
intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and
no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of
time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner." 65. Midrash Ha-Gadol, Genesis 12:1 66. Chaos, the formless emptiness of the uncreated world, is described in
Genesis as tohu va-vohu: the cosmological dimension of a full emptiness out

of which everything is engendered holds both horror and fascination for
human beings, whose essential need is for structure. (See Rashi's comment
on these words, Genesis 1:2.) Tebiya is tobu on the existential plane. 67. Tanbuma, Lekh Lekha, 2. 68. In Pahad Yitzhak (Pesah, 17:5), Rav Yitzhak Hutner explores the
theme of the necessity of the question. Often, he suggests, the answer is in
greater need of a good question than the question is in need of an answer.
Only when imperfection, need, tension are authentically experienced, (the
"anomaly" of which Kuhn writes) does man progress toward wholeness.
Resolution without tension is a joyless triumph. In these terms, Rav Hutner
discusses the indeterminacy of Abraham's journey: knowledge comes to him
"as the answer to a real question, not as an arbitrary answer" — as response to
an existence fabricated out of questions. "When God caused me to wander
away from my father's house" (Genesis 20:13) — "God led me to know Him
precisely through the experiences of felt not-knowing." 69. Kuhn, Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 87. 70. Sefat Emet 5648.
VA-YERA

1. "Take please": Na is an expression of request. God said to Abraham,
   "Please stand firm for Me in this test, so that people should not say, The first
   tests had no substance to them."
2. B. Sanhedrin 89b.
3. See Genesis 12:7-8 and 13:4.
4. Isaiah 41:8.
5. Rashi's comment is based on Tanbuma, Shelah, 14. It is interesting to
   notice that in the original midrash, the prooftext is, "Go, eat your bread in
   gladness ... for your action was long ago approved by God" (Ecclesiastes
   9:7). Abraham is vindicated and the effect is—bathetically? — that he can
   return to his se'udah, to the feasting that generated the doubts that made the
   test necessary in the first place.

really ate, or only appeared to eat. 16. Cf. Ruth 3:7: "Boaz ate and drank, and in a cheerful mood went to lie
down"; and the comment in Ruth Rabbah: " Hn a cheerful mood" (lit., his heart
was good) — he made a blessing over his food. Or, he ate a variety of sweets that
train the tongue for Torah." The implication is that Boaz is fully nurtured by
the world, and can make use of reality: by an act of alchemy, food is
metabolized to creative play in Torah. (See Likutei Moharan 1, 19:7.) 17. Cf. Harvey Cox, in Feast of Fools (Harper and Row: 1969), writes of the
prodigality and fantasy, the "calculated excess" implied in feasting and living
it up, dressing up. Cf. Abraham's teaching to Sarah: "This is no time for
austerity [modesty] — uncover your breasts and nurse all the princes of the
world!" (Bereshit Rabbah 53:13). 18. B. Sotah 10b. Cf. Rashi on this verse. 19. See Rashi on this verse: "hotel, a place where the stranger is lodged,

Sanhedrin 89b—se 'udah—is rooted in the invitation that Abraham extends to
the angels — "SaWh libkhem" — "you may refresh yourselves" —lit., support
your heart (18:5). This is the primary concept of eating; as Rashi points out,
the expression "heart support" is used throughout Scriptures for "food."
What Abraham is offering is an experience in which dependency is overcome
and the hazards of growth and separation are mediated. 25. See Rashi on 7:23. 26. Tanhuma, Lekh Lekha, 12. 27. R. Hutner, Pahad Yitzhak, Pesah, 18:5. 28. Cf. B. Yevamot 79a, where this source is chosen as the prooftext for

"potential space" —to R. Daniel Epstein. 47. Cf. Matthew Arnold, Culture and Anarchy, 48. Rashi suggests (on v.31) that the historical reference here is to the two
thousand years before Abraham's time: the fully human phase of "sons of
men" begins with Abraham, whose work it is to grow "sons of men" out of
the culture of a merely potential universe. 49. "The Hermeneutic Quest in Robinson Crusoe" in Midrash and

were no justice, no judge. To Jonah, this is an outrage against emet, the Truth,
that is so conspicuously missing from his list of divine attributes (4:2).
Without Truth, hesed seems to him a deplorable, even self-destructive foible
of God. 45. Cf. Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Teshuva, chap. 7, in which Rambam
traces the complexities of sin, penitence, reward, and punishment. Rambam
reiterates constantly that the transcendent truth is in no way derivable from
experience. On the contrary, "Do not say. . . . ," "Let the penitent not
imagine that. . . . ," "A person should always see himself as though. . . ." 46. See Rashi, 24:14. 47. Bereshit Rabbah 60:2. 48. See, for instance, the injunction, "Azov ta yazov into—You shall indeed
come to the aid of your enemy, whose donkey has collapsed under its burden"
(Exodus 23:5). The ambiguities and rhetorical questions involved in this text
are the subject of much rabbinic commentary. For an unequivocal example of
azav as "reinforcement," see Nehemiah 3:8. 49. Neher, Exile of the Word, 285-86. 50. This is not a moment of joy; for doubt and suspense make awkward
bedfellows with joy. The legacy of Sarah's death is her last cry. According to
the Midrash Ha-Gadol (2 3:2), Kiryat Arba, the place of her death ("the city of
four"), is called so because of her four death cries—expressing sadness on
hearing her son's fate; wailing for her son; the bitterness of her death; and
mourning for the fact that there is no perfect joy. These carefully  
differentiated modes culminate in the "reversibility of joy," as the Midrash OrAfela
has it. Realization of the volatile nature of experience and consciousness is not
easily neutralized. 51. Bereshit Rabbah 60:14. 52. See the commentary of Ha'amek Davar on this meeting.

1. It is striking that even the cheated Esau in the heat of his bitterness has
   no stronger recrimination than "and now he has taken my blessing" (27:36).

Toledot 3. Ibid., 67:4. 4. Ramban focuses on the unexpectedness of Isaac's reply. He  
mobilizes this to intensify the outrage of Isaac's question, which now covers the
involuntary nature of the blessing: he trembles all the more violently for
knowing that the blessing is a reality, in spite of his intention and present
feeling. 5. Beresbit Rabbah 67:3. 6. Compare "And Jacob called his sons" (49:1), which introduces his
deathbed blessings. 7. Beresbit Rabbah 67:10. 8. Ibid., 78:14. 9. Rashi is reponding here to the past tense form of berakbtani. He
translates literally, "till you admit my having been blessed, in the past." 10. Sarna, Understanding Genesis; 188. 11. Ramban, 27:12 12. B. Sanhedrin 92a. 13. Midrash Misblei 10:17. 14.

The striking feature of this version of the midrash is that Abraham
cannot come to his own just assessment of the facts, even after God has
changed Isaac's appearance. It is because of the consensus of opinion of
others, who can see both father and son, that Abraham's suspicions are
allayed. The visual factor, the criterion of perspective and opinion, remains
central, even after the miracle. 20. Lionel Trilling discusses this concept, and its relation to the  
"sentiments of art," in Sincerity and Authenticity (Harvard University Press: 1971),

sentiment of being,** comes from Rousseau*s Second Discourse, where he compares
the savage who "lives within himself*' with the sociable man who "knows
how to live only in the opinion of others, and it is, so to speak, from their
judgment alone that he draws the sentiment of his own being** (quoted in
Trilling, 62). 70. Shakespeare, Hamlet, I, ii, 76. 71. Rashi comments on "I ate of it all**: "All delicacies that I sought to
taste, I tasted in his food.'\* Isaac experiences the triumph of the desiring
imagination, fusing the sensual with the spiritual—a similar notion to the
classic midrashic descriptions of the taste of the manna, and the experience of
receiving the Torah at Mount Sinai. 72. Compare Abarbanel's reading of lo hikiro. Unlike most  
commentators, he translates, "he did not identify him,** rather than "he did not
recognize him." 73. In the Beresbit Rabbah source, Jacob describes his anokhi differently:
"/ am destined to receive the Ten Commandments** — a word-play on the
opening statement of the Ten Commandments: "lam the Lord your God.\*'
In this reading, Jacob's identity will find full standing only in the anokhi
encounter of Sinai, where man will achieve an unprecedented strength to
"stand** in the presence of God. [See essay on "Bereshit,*' especially pp. 20-
36.] See also the comment of Ibn Ezra on Jacob's "disinformation:" he rejects
all attempts to split the sentence and argues that the sentence must be

refer to the field, on the one hand, and to "my son," on the other. "The smell
of my son . . . whom God has blessed—is like the smell of the field," is a
workable reading of the text. See the commentary of Mizrahi on the verse. 100. See Winnicott, Playing and Reality, 101. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 32. 102. This is a common theme in Sacks's books—e.g., A Leg to Stand On

VA-YISHLAH

1. Midrashic tradition associates this death with the death of Rebecca
   herself— a covert way of referring to a death too painful to describe. (/Illon is
   "other" in Greek: "another weeping" encodes a reference to an undescribed
   death.) See Rashi and Ramban, 35:8.
2. Compare the disagreement between Rashi and Ramban on whether
   the following clause—"the Lord shall be my God"—belongs to the condition
   or the promise part of the vow.
3. Compare the terms of Rebecca's directions to him: "Stay [ve-
   yashavta] with him" (27:44). "He stayed with him a month's time" (29:14). In
   retrospect, what had at the time been experienced as a real settling and
   cooperation dwindles into an episode, radically unimportant. There may, of
   course, be a tactical element in Jacob's presentation of himself to his brother
   as unchanged.
4. See Rashi: Jacob is afraid to repeat God's words, crediting Isaac with a
   relationship to God, even while he is still alive and his "godliness" is still in
   question.
5. B. Megillah 17a.
6. The moral question about Dinah's responsibility for her own fate
   does not arise in these midrashic treatments. To all intents and purposes,
   Dinah becomes a dream figure in Jacob's consciousness—as, indeed, do all
   the characters in his narrative—as the midrash traces the patterns, shadowy
   and often repressed, of his experience.
7. See Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 35: "Jacob fell on his face on the ground,
   in front of the Stone of Foundation, and prayed to God: Master of all worlds,
   if you bring me back to this place in wholeness, I will sacrifice before You
   offerings of thanks and burnt offerings—as it is said, 'And Jacob made a
   vow.'" Targum Jonathan also indicates that the core meaning of a vow is
   sacrifice.

14. Before this, only God has made promises; and—as Rashi comments
    in a classic passage (Exodus 6:3-8)—His promises have made human beings
    peculiarly aware of the "dangerous" quality of words unfulfilled.

408
Va-Yishlah 16. Maharal describes the connection differently: Jacob's tragic flaw,
expressed covertly when he withholds Dinah from Esau, becomes visible,
cries out to high heaven, after he has delayed on his return home. His delay
acts as a catalyst: the ledgers fall open for rigorous inspection (Gur Arye,
32:22). 17. Bereshit Kabbah 76:9. 18. Saint Augustine, The City of God (Hafner Library: 1948), 78-81. 19. Bereshit Kabbah 80:3. 20. B. Megillah 18a. 21. Bereshit Kabbah 79:10. 22.

This issue of sincerity, when Esau embraces Jacob, acquires a strange
significance among the commentators, evidently for historical reasons. See
Rashi, 33:4; Sifrei, Be-ha'alotkha, 69. 30. In a striking passage, Terry Eagleton puts the point in post-
structuralist terms:
Since the meaning of a sign is a matter of what the sign is not, its
meaning is always in some sense absent from it too. Meaning,
if you like, is scattered or dispersed along the whole chain
of signifiers: it cannot be easily nailed down, it is never fully
present in any one sign alone, but is rather a kind of constant
flickering of presence and absence together. . . . There is also
another sense in which we can never quite close our fists over
meaning, which arises from the fact that language is a  
temporal process. When I read a sentence, the meaning of it is
always somehow suspended, something deferred or still to
come. . . . There is always more meaning where that came
from. {Literary Theory [University of Minnesota Press: 1983], 128)
This idea of the constant modification of meaning in a text is a characteristic
"Jacob approach" to reading: "There is always more meaning where that
came from." 31. See p. 89-93 for a discussion of this theme, in connection with the
Binding of Isaac. God delays giving information to the righteous—in order to
generate lave for the commandment. Mystery, the unspoken edge of words,
is the source of interpretation and self-knowledge.

Notes
409 32. There is an extraordinary midrash (Bereshit Rabbab 80:6) that focuses
on three words signifying Shekhem's love (davek, hashek, hafetz) as the  
paradigms for the relation between God and Israel. Savage and lawless as She-
khenVs act is, the feelings become a kind of pure ore, something raw and
undistilled, which provides a glossary, as it were, for the texts of spiritual
passion. 33. "I have seen a divine being face to face" (32:31) suggests naked
confrontation with a powerful force in human guise. 34. See Trilling, Sincerity and Authenticity, 131-32, where he describes
the violence in modernist art as necessary "to startle ... to retrieve the
human spirit from its acquiescence in non-being." 35. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 37. 36. Ha'amek Davar 32:32. 37. See Ramban, who traces a fascinating etymological chain, through
the Targum: wrestling comes to evoke seduction, strategy, and clarification. 38. Bereshit Rabbah 78:3. 39. Harold Bloom uses this expression to translate the word berakha
("blessing"): an apt translation, since the word everywhere suggests "more-
ness," increase, as kelala ("curse") suggests diminution. See Ibn Ezra, 49:7. 40. See Ha'amek Davar 35:10. 41. Quoted in Harold Bloom, A Map of Misreading (Oxford University
Press: 1975), 163. 42. Ibid., 19. 43. See Ramban, 31:42. The "Fear of Isaac" is explicitly traced to the
Akedah experience. 44. Bloom, Map of Misreading, 38. 45. Ramban, 46:1. 46. Bloom, Map of Misreading, 69-70. 47. In his prayer before meeting Esau's army, Jacob does speak of "God of
my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac" but, as Rashi implies, he is
effectively quoting God's previous promise to him, in the dream at Beth El.
He himself is "afraid" (Rashi, 31:42) to speak of his father and his relation to
God in any terms other than that of "fear" in his father's lifetime. 48. John Milton, Paradise Lost, quoted in Bloom, Map of Misreading, 63. 49. See Meshekh Hokhmah 35:1:" 'Arise, go to Beth El and remain there;
and build an altar there to the God [El] who appeared to you.' There he built
an altar ... for it was there that God [Elohim] had revealed Himself to
him" (35:1,7). The name El refers to the God of love, while the name Elohim
refers to the God of Justice, or Dread. Jacob acquires the personal, active
vision of El, on the basis of a revelation of Elohim, in which he is not active
(God imposes the knowledge of dread on man, while man works actively to
see God as the God of love). In terms of our reading, Jacob's passive relation

410
Va-Yeshev
to Elohim is a function of his overinfluence by his father and his father's
vision of reality. 50. At crucial points of his life, Jacob refers to his sense of ra, of evil
besetting his consciousness. See 44:29, 34; 47:9; 48:16. 51. See Ramban, 32:13: "All these references to tov ["goodness"] are
derived from God's promise—'I shall be with you.'" 52. SefatEmet, 5649.
5 3. This verse figures importantly in midrashic and hasidic reflections on
this Parsha: see, e.g., Sefat Emet 5652, 5653. 54. See the first chapter of the present volume for a discussion of this idea. 55. The verse is quoted several times in the Talmud, as proof that "Adam
was created with two faces," facing front and back (e.g., B. Enivin 18b; see
Rashi). Sexual differentiation results from the splitting apart of this original
androgynous being.

8. See 26:3, "Stay a stranger in this land," and Midrash Ha-Gadol on this
   verse: "This teaches you that when the righteous settle in this world it is
   a mere sojourning to them" and on 26:6—Isaac accepts God's command,
   somewhat against his own view of things, and stays in Canaan, in time of
   famine. This self-subjugation to God is signified by the idea of "sojourning."
9. Ramban, 37:1." 'It is through Isaac that offspring shall be continued

Notes
411 18. See Rashi, quoting the Targum: "Aval—'m truth/ " Hirsch gives a
similar reading of aval. 19. SekhelTov 37:33. 20. Beresbit Rabbah 74:7. 21. See Psalms 111:5 and Proverbs 30:8.
2 2. In chapter 3, Job speaks of olalim—babies—as a figure of rudimentary
being, the product of pure causality, "all dirt and laughter," as Rashi  
wonderfully puts it (3:16). They represent most clearly the humiliating human fate of
"being already born,, (see Ricoeur, History and Truth, 290). 23. Franz Kafka, The Trial (Penguin: 1953), 240. 24. Ibid., 243.
2 5. The anger is explicit in the source of the midrash (Tanbuma, 5). Judah
lists Joseph's "plots," and concludes, "I swear . . . that if I pull my sword out
of its sheath, I shall fill the whole of Egypt with corpses." Ramban softens the
unequivocal anger of the midrashic reading—which does not seem to emerge
clearly from the biblical text—and suggests that Judah's accusation against
the ruler is only implicit, "hinted in his words." 26. See Elaine Scarry, The Body in Pain (Oxford University Press: 1987),
for a study of mute pain as the aim of the torturer, who hopes to deprive his
victim of language and of a connection with human institutions. This is what
Scarry calls the "unmaking of the world." 27. Gur Arye, 42:28. 28. See Rashbam, 37:28, who suggests that while the brothers were
waiting to sell him to the Ishmaelites, Midianite traders passed by and drew
Joseph out, without the brothers' knowledge. 29. See Leviticus 1:6. 30. Erich Fromm, The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness (Fawcett Crest:

and the use of the word ha-lazeh (see Ha'amek Davar) both suggest a lack of
passionate involvement, which perhaps constitutes a defense strategy. 35. See Ha-ketav Ve-ba-kabala 42:22. 36. See the piyyut, "Eileb ezkera" on the Ten Martyrs, in the Musaf

discussion of the Freudian motifs in the Joseph narrative. 44. See Ha'amek Davar 42:11. 45. See Schwartz, "Joseph's Bones," 50, for a perceptive reading of the
"nakedness of the land," as "the sight of something that should remain
hidden, something that is illicit to see. Only Joseph's recent effort to repress
his past can make sense of this response, for the very presence of the brothers
violates what Joseph is trying to hide from himself: his memory of their
abuse." 46. The root nakar is common to both the verb "to recognize" and the
verb "to make oneself strange." 47. Bereshit Rabbah 99:9. 48. B. Sotah 10b. 49. Benjamin, "Image of Proust," 204 50. Mei Ha-Shiloah, 1, Va-yeshev, 14. 51. This definition of "fear," as the human response to divine providence,
is the Ishbitzer's, earlier in the passage. 52. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, 36. 53. Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative (Basic Books: 1981), 4. 54. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 38. 55. Rashi (45:27) cites a midrash associating the wagons (agalot) with the
work of memory: Joseph sends word reminding his father of the last Torah
issue they had studied together, before his kidnapping— the laws of egla arufa,
the heifer whose neck is broken, in token of the self-exoneration of society
when a corpse is found, unaccounted for. The heifer becomes a powerful
poetic metaphor, recollecting motifs from the past—brokenness, murder, the
extent of responsibility, the shared culture of father and son. On this reading,
Jacob comes to life under the impact of a potent poetic image and of the
demands of interpretation that it makes on him. 56. Mann, Joseph and His Brothers, 1124. 57. Ibid., 1127-28. 58. Ibid., 1133. 59. Ibid., 1136. 60. Ibid., 1130. 61. Midrash Ha-Gadol 45:26.

5. Kefitza ("leap"), the word Rashi uses to translate nasha, usually means
   a jump with both feet (as opposed to rikud ["dance"] and dilug ["skip"], for

as "having other thoughts" — for example, on Genesis 6:6. Thus, both  
"comfort" and "regret" are covered by this single concept of a change in cognitive
gestalt.
3 5. There are midrashic sources that claim that Jacob does not believe his
sons' story. See Rashi Ha-Sbalem on 3 7, note 80. But Rashi clearly reads Jacob
as believing that Joseph is dead. 36. Beresbit Rabbah 91:1. 37. Wallace Stevens, "Notes towards a Supreme Fiction." 38. Ramban takes this view of the dynamic between Jacob and Rachel. 39. Isaiah 56:3. See Seforno, who also quotes this verse to explain
Rachel's sense of herself as "dead." 40. Beresbit Rabbah 70:17. 41. See 42:4, 38. See also B. Hulin 95b and J. Shabbat 6:5, where the
chain of disappearances is implicitly traced back to Rachel's death "on the
way." See Torab Temimah on 42:36. 42. In this reading, it is interesting that Rachel is considered the genuine
mother of all twelve tribes. In intention and desire, all Jacob's work for Laban
was for her. She is the wife and the mother who is "not there" in reality, but
who persists in imagination. 43. See Ramban, who translates "on the road there" in temporal, rather
than spatial terms: Rachel is buried at the point of contact with the future
passage of her children. 44. See Gur Arye, 48:7. See also the translation in Targum Jonathan of
Jeremiah 31:15: uKenessetyisrael is called Rachel." 45. Rashi comments on the masking effect of a beard (42:8). 46. See the translation oishama (21:22) in Targum Onkelos. 47. Samson Raphael Hirsch comments on the relation between bakha
("to weep") and bakay pakah ("to burst out"). Rashi quotes a midrashic
discussion about the genuineness of Esau's kiss. But tears are self-evidently
genuine and need no discussion. 48. George Steiner, Real Presences (University of Chicago Press: 1989), 96.

Notes
415 49. "The basis of man's life with man is twofold, and it is one—the wish of
every man to be confirmed as what he is, even as what he can become, by men;
and the innate capacity in man to confirm his fellow-men in this way." R. D.
Laing quotes this passage from Martin Buber as epigraph to his discussion
of "Confirmation and Disconfirmation," in Self and Others (Penguin: 1968), 98. He begins his discussion by emphasizing the partial, complex nature of
human confirmation: in Buber's words, it "is always 'to some extent or
other.'" 50. Paul Ricoeur, History and Truth, 322. 51. Neher, Exile of the Word, 236. 52. Ricoeur, History and Truth, 322. 53. See the chapter on Hayyei Sarah in this volume. 54.

   changing formulations of punishment.
2. See the chapter on Va-yeshev in this volume.
3. The irony of using this rhetorical gesture ("What can we say?") as
   preface to a flood of words is picked up in the introductory passage to the
   Selihot (the penitential prayers), which quotes Judah's inarticulate cry, before
   launching into the many-worded prayers of the Days of Atonement.

Va-Yiggash 13. See Midrash Ha-Gadol 44:18: "Va-yiggash means 'to examine/ " 14. Bereshit Rabbah 93:3. 15. Ibid., 93:8. 16. The midrashic tradition narrates that, in spite of Judah's fulfillment of
his guarantee to his father, he is in fact doomed to an eternity of restless
alienation: "All forty years that the Israelites were in the wilderness, Judah's
bones were rolling around in his coffin, because of the excommunication that
he accepted upon himself, as it is said, 'And I shall be a sinner to my father all
the days'" (44:32). (See Rashi, Deuteronomy 33:7.) He is ultimately released
from his fate; but the striking notion here is the absolute, unconditional
nature of his assumption of a fate of alienation. It is as though so complete a
commitment to the pain of others brands one apart from those others. 17. Judah puts the words, "You shall not see my face" into Joseph's
mouth—twice, in fact (43:3, 5)—although in the original version of Joseph's
decree, these words do not occur. This is Judah's pragmatic translation of the
meaning of Joseph's more "academic" statement: "Let your words be  
verified, so that you do not die" (42:20). 18. Lit., from my hand you may seek him. The play on hand imagery goes
back to the scene by the pit, where the direct "hands-on" involvement in
murder had led both Reuben and Judah to suggest less direct methods of
disposing of Joseph. Now, Judah recognizes an immediate physical  
responsibility, as a necessary feature of full moral agency. 19. See Torah Shelemah 43:13. In a passage in B. Baba Batra 173b, the
sages disagree over whether Judah's offer can be considered conceptually as
arevut— "standing surety." The long footnote discusses the implications of
this disagreement. 20. Tanbu?na, 1. 21. B. Sotah 10b. 22. Ibid. 23. Bereshit Rabbah 85:9. 24. Joseph is referred to as JeAoseph, including the letter heh from God's
name, in Psalms 81:6. 25. Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative, 11-12. 26. Likkutei Moharan 2:77. 27. See, however, Joel bin Nun's provocative suggestion that Jacob's
reported speech, "Alas, he was torn by a beast!" (44:28), does constitute news
for Joseph, who has assumed that Jacob's failure to search for him in Egypt
stems from neglect, or undue influence by the other brothers. In this reading,
Joseph's whole understanding of his father's attitude is changed by Judah's
speech; he now knows of the brothers' deception, and can no longer refrain
from revealing his identity (Megadimy 1, 20). 28. Sefat Emet, 5637.

Notes
417 29. See Jerome Bruner, Actual Minds, Possible Worlds (Harvard University
Press: 1986). In his chapter on "the transactional self," he cites a study in
which he found that "by their first birthday children are already adept at
following another's line of regard to search for an object that is engaging their
partner's attention" (60). Apparent egocentrism, he suggests, is really a
failure to grasp the structure of events (68). Using this model, one might say
that Judah's capacity to take Jacob's perspective depends on his growing
understanding of the human situation. 30. Levinas, Nine Talmudic Readings, 47; italics mine. 31. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, 102. 32. Ibid., 102-3. 33. B. Sotah 10b. 34. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, 78. 35. Ibid., 80. 36. The expression is Rorty's, who uses it to describe Proust's success and
to discriminate between the successes and failures in the work of Nietzsche
and Heidegger. 37. Beresbit Rabbab 8:5. The idea is reflected in the initial letters of the
quotation from Psalms: Emet Me-eretz Titzmab. These constitute the word
Emet: truth is woven from the separated letters, grounded in earth and
becoming. 38. See Sefat Emet, 5637. 39. Or Ha-Hayyim 45:26. 40. Or Ha-Hayyim quotes the sages' classic dictum about the taboo of
causing shame: "A person should rather throw himself into a fiery furnace
than shame his friend" (lit., cause his face to go pale). 41. See Beresbit Rabbab 93:9. 42. See, for instance, Rambam, Hilkbot Tesbuva 1:1, which includes
shame as one aspect of regret for past actions. 43. See Or Ha-Hayyim 45:4. 44. B. Menahot\*99b. 45. Sefat Emet, 5643. 46. See Targum Onkelos, Rashi, and Ramban. 47. Traditional readings of lo yakbol in many biblical contexts similarly
emphasize the force of an idea to "incapacitate," and, in effect, to mold the
moral personality. See, for instance, Deuteronomy 31:2, with Rashi's  
commentary. 48. Ramban distinguishes between two expressions for evil report (meivi
and motzi), on the basis of the truth or falsehood of the report. 49. Mann, Joseph and His Brothers, 1207. 50. Beresbit Rabbah 93:5.

Shalem, 44, note 10. 55. Bereshit Rahhah 91:13. 56. From Yalkut Midrash Teiman, a manuscript quoted in Torah Shelemah
43:86. 57. "But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?" (Shakespeare, Mac-
beth, n, ii, 32). 58. B. Sanhedrin 107a. 59. Sefat Emet, 5648. 60. Shakespeare, Hamlet, HI, ii, 366-72. 61. Tanhuma Yashan, 3. 62. SeeRashbam 45:1. 63. See Sefat Emet, 5644. 64. Bereshit Rahhah 93:8. 65. Jonathan Miller, States of Mind (Pantheon: 1983), 40-41. 66. Bereshit Rahhah 94:3. The passage studied was the law of the broken-
necked heifer (eglah larufd), which deals with the problem of an unidentified
corpse and society's responsibility for the murder. The coded message works
on several levels at once, therefore: the theme of death and responsibility is
obviously appropriate, while the intimacy of the learning experience is
evoked as the surest proof of identity. Seeing the agalot is a trigger for a
complex response, in which aural, linguistic memory, and associations are
central. 67. Both Rashi and Ramban resolve the ambiguity of the pronouns in this
verse in this way; though Rashi consistently reads Joseph as the subject of
the whole sentence, while Ramban changes the subject of "he kissed,'' and
"he fell on his neck" to Jacob ("Who cries more, father for son, or son for
father?"). 68. See Or Ha-Hayyim 46:30. 69. See Or Ha-Hayyim 48:14. 70. This forms the beginning of the Haftara—the additional reading—
for the week.
VA-YEHI

1. See Rashi, 12:2, on the words, "And you shall be a blessing."
2. See Rashi, 25:11.

Notes
419 3. See B. Baba Metzia 87a. 4. See Yalkut Shim&ni, Lekh Lekha, 77; Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 52. 5. Midrasb Ha-Gadol 48:1. 6. See Rashbam, 29:25. 7. From here, according to Rashi (48:2), we learn the principle of
respectful behavior toward kings, even non-Jewish kings. Sifiei Hakhamim
emphasizes the paradox of this principle, in a situation where Joseph is, as it
were, "needy" of his father's blessing. 8. Bereshit Rabbah 96:3. 9. The most obvious reading would limit this "charge" to his burial
instructions (49:29-33). But midrashic readings broaden the scope of the
"charge" to cover the largest disposition of Jacob's spiritual estate. See Torah
Sbelemab, 49, note 403. 10. In his first anguish at the loss of Joseph, Jacob says: "I will go down
mourning to my son in She'ol [the grave, the underworld]" (37:35). This is
realized when he in fact "goes down" to Egypt to see his son again after
twenty-two years. 11. Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western
Literature, trans. Willard R. Trask (Princeton University Press: 1953), 12. 12. Bereshit Rabbah 96:1. The "closedness" of the text would represent
the seamless nature of the narrative: there is, of course, no narrative break
between verses 27 and 28. But the very meaning of the word Parsha has to do
with "separation," with spacing the text, as an aid toward interpreting it,
toward perceiving its structures, explicit and implicit. Sometimes, the break
seems forced; here, it is both forced and neutralized by "blocking." 13. The traditional understanding is that enslavement properly speaking
began only after the entire generation of Jacob's children had died. 14. Bereshit Rabbah 2:5. 15. Rashi, B. Ta'anit 24b; B. Megilla 22b. 16. This entreaty comes at the end of the amidah, the main prayer,
suggesting the move from the prayer mode to the intellectual mode of Torah
study, in which one needs "light of the eyes and of the heart/mind." See B.
Berakhot 16a. 17. Zobar, 1, 209b, quoted in Torah Sbelemab, 47 [50]. 18. See Isaiah 2:2; Ezekiel 38:16; Hosea 3:5; Micah 4:1; Daniel 10:14. 19. See Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending (Oxford University Press:
1967), a study of apocalyptic movements in history and of "endings" in
literature. 20. Moses' famous cry that he is "of uncircumcised lips" is translated by
Rashi to mean "blocked, impassible, sealed." The imagery of the foreskin can
be used to suggest an excess that prevents proper functioning, of the ears
(Jeremiah 6:10), the mind (Jeremiah 9:25), or even of fruit trees, banned

420
Va-Yebi
from harvesting for the first three years (Leviticus 19:23). This notion of
atum, of the impediment that weighs down and closes off, is related to our
theme of setima, the "block." 21. SefatEmet, Va-yehi, 5635. 22. Zohar 234b. 23. B. Pesahim 56a. 24. Douglas, Purity and Danger (Penguin: 1966). 25. Shakespeare, Sonnet 129. 26. See Rashi, 31:3:" 'Return to the land of your fathers'— and there I shall

realization that his transaction with Joseph is indicated in God's blessing at Luz—
his singling out of Joseph is rooted in God's words. 39. See the chapter on Va-yetze in this volume. 40. See Seforno, who suggests that what he sees is a blurred double
presence that he cannot identify. 41. Tanhuma, Va-yehi 6. 42. See Seforno, who relates the need for vision to the capacity for
blessing, in the context of Moses' death. 43. Several commentators—e.g., Mizrahi—read pilalti as a reference to a
rigorous thought process that would hold open positive possibilities. Jacob
accuses himself of a precipitate despair, a closing of the issue without further
internal debate. See also Targum Onkelos, who translates la sivarit. 44. Bereshit Rabbati, 227-28. 45. This text is often quoted in midrashic narratives, as a key to Jacob's
later life. See, e.g., Midrash Sekhel Tov, quoted in Torah Shelemah, 87 [189];
Bereshit Rabbab, 94:4. 46. See Or Ha-Hayyim, 48:8

therefore the unusual expression about his death: he was not in the world to

In her first book, Genesis: The Beginning of
Desire, based on her immensely popular  
weekly lectures in Jerusalem, Avivah Zornberg
reanimates the ancient characters of the Bible
through her lyrical prose and modern  
sensibilities. We share these characters' struggles to
understand the disturbing paradoxes of human
existence—why "not to have is the beginning
of desire," why wisdom must so often be
earned through personal suffering, and why
blessings sometimes exact so high a price.
For ten years, Zornberg has mesmerized
overflowing audiences as she struggles  
personally with these complex texts, sharing her own
understanding of how life and text inform
each other. In Genesis, as in her shiurim  
(lectures), her meditations magically weave
together biblical, midrashic, and literary
sources into a seamless tapestry. A charismatic
teacher and Cambridge scholar, Zornberg
draws upon her background, steeped in Jewish
knowledge and western literature, to create a
rare synthesis of Jewish and European  
intellectual history. The effect is breathtaking.
In these pages, we join Avivah Zornberg as
she wrestles with the parshiyot, the weekly  
biblical readings. And as we read with her, we
bring to bear our own internal conflicts and
reflect upon what she writes. Thus we see the
words of Torah as though, in Rashi's words,
"they were given this very day."
Zornberg illumines the inevitable tensions
that grip human beings as they search for and
encounter God: the disorder that threatens
order, the instability that shatters stability. On
the one hand, she writes, we are reassured to
find our own tensions reflected in these
ancient texts. But on the other hand, the
midrashic strategy we bring to the texts will
not comfort us with a formalized, serenely
fixed image of human life, with pious homilet-
ical messages to shore up our insecurities. For
the Torah that seemed so accessible is more
multi-layered than we knew; it can be  
approached only by the strenuous and  
imaginative 'making' of the reader.
Avivah Zornberg guides us as we deepen
our desire to understand the words of the
Bible, a process that has as much to do with
our intimate experience in the human world as
■with God's own will working through us as we
read the divine Book. Genesis: The Beginning of
Desire, is modern, literate, and spiritual.

AVIVAH GOTTLIEB ZORNBERG was
born in England to a rabbinic family. She grew
up in Glasgow, Scotland, where her father was
a rabbi and head of the rabbinical court. She
studied at Gateshead seminary and at  
Cambridge University, where she received her
Ph.D. in English literature. Before she began
teaching Torah and Midrash in 1981, she was a
Lecturer in the English Department at
Hebrew University. Since then, she has taught
widely attended classes on Parshat HaShavua
(the weekly Torah reading) to thousands of
students in Israel at MaTaN, Jerusalem
College for Adults, Midreshet Lindenbaum,
and Pardes Institute. She also lectures widely
in the United States and Canada.
Avivah Zornberg is unique among scholars
in that she blends together a deep  
understanding of all the great rabbinic sources with a  
classical Western education. Her background in
English literature has given her an unusual
sensitivity to language, a skill that, we see in
this her first book, translates beautifully into
her own writings.
