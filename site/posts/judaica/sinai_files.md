## Sinai Files

<blockquote>
<p>
Just testing the <b>bold</b> and **beautiful**.

Based on the article in Chabad.org, called ["The Sinai Files"](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1281/jewish/The-Sinai-Files.htm) &mdash; A SciFi/Fantasy version of the classic story of Moses' battle with the angels to receive the Torah by [Tzvi Freeman](https://www.chabad.org/search/keyword_cdo/kid/193/jewish/Freeman-Tzvi.htm) from our Sages - may their light illuminate our path for generations to come - (Talmud, _Shabbat_ 88b)

## Overview

The Sinai Files fantasy is a wonderful personalisation of the story of the Jewish people receiving the Torah. Our hero, Moshe Rabeinu, has been brought to heaven to receive the Torah. The angels object to G-d giving this Divine (one could say magical) Gift to the human beings who are filled with sin and doubt; with jealousy and greed; wallowing in their self-imposed despair and desperation.

Moses challenges them from a human point of view, asking them whether they know whether it is to contend with labour, and needs, and service, as well as faith.

In the end, he convinces them, and they all praise him for his eloquence and strong argument. Even the angel of death helps him.

Afterwards, apparently, Satan (who does not seem to have any authority over the angel of death. <span class="note">{NOTE: Which brings me to think that Satan only has power over the fallen ones, the demons, not any angels. That is part of his punishment}.</span>

He asks the natural elements where the Torah is, and they all answer that they do not know!

## Ten Words

> G-d, our Divine Creator,vb makes the natural world by words, so we make the human word by our words.

The Torah in heaven and the Torah as it is manifested on earth is not the same. It is not fashioned from the same material. The two languages (words) are not the same.

Yet they do "say the same things". This is shown by the manner in which they were seen by us, . G-d's Words were couched in occurrances which occurred in the natural world: thunder and lightning; fire on the mountain; a cloud of smoke. These are the Words, pronounced by G-d, Blessed is His Name, that were seen by us. {There are big words and small words. In order to "get our attention", G-d, may His Name be on our lips forevermore, needs to be speak in a big voice.} If the Ten Commandments were given in Ten Words of G-d, may we continue to serve Him, and these Ten Words contained the full Torah and all its future commentaries &mdash; according to the the [Sinai Files](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1281/jewish/The-Sinai-Files.htm), one would have to conclude that these Words were multi-dimensional.

The purest form was the tablets handed to Moses. One could say also that it was the densest &ndash; or would intense be more accurate &ndash; form, being the most compact and concentrated. Out of this vibration emerged the written Torah, closer to the Torah as written by Moshe Rabeinu. As its original vibration reverberated through the generation, and needs morphed, so the Talmud, Mishna and Gemora were written by our Sages. Till now, under the influence of Kabbalah mysticism, has reached much subtler, less dense, forms of expression.

## Talmud <i>Shabbat</i> 88b:7

 <blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
וְאָמַר רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן לֵוִי: בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁעָלָה מֹשֶׁה לַמָּרוֹם אָמְרוּ מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת לִפְנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא: רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם, מַה לִּילוּד אִשָּׁה בֵּינֵינוּ? אָמַר לָהֶן: לְקַבֵּל תּוֹרָה בָּא. אָמְרוּ לְפָנָיו: חֶמְדָּה גְּנוּזָה שֶׁגְּנוּזָה לָךְ תְּשַׁע מֵאוֹת וְשִׁבְעִים וְאַרְבָּעָה דּוֹרוֹת קוֹדֶם שֶׁנִּבְרָא הָעוֹלָם, אַתָּה מְבַקֵּשׁ לִיתְּנָהּ לְבָשָׂר וָדָם? ״מָה אֱנוֹשׁ כִּי תִזְכְּרֶנּוּ וּבֶן אָדָם כִּי תִפְקְדֶנּוּ״? ״ה׳ אֲדֹנֵינוּ מָה אַדִּיר שִׁמְךָ בְּכׇל הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר תְּנָה הוֹדְךָ עַל הַשָּׁמָיִם״!

<p>
</p>

<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When Moses ascended on High</b> to receive the Torah, <b>the ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, what is one born of a woman</b> doing here <b>among us?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to them: He came to receive the Torah.</b> The angels <b>said before Him:</b> The Torah is a <b>hidden treasure that was concealed by you 974 generations before the creation of the world,</b> and <b>you seek to give it to flesh and blood?</b> As it is stated: "The word which He commanded to a thousand generations" ([Psalms 105:8](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.105.8)). Since the Torah, the word of God, was given to the twenty-sixth generation after Adam, the first man, the remaining 974 generations must have preceded the creation of the world. <b>"What is man that You are mindful of him and the son of man that You think of him?"</b> ([Psalms 8:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.5)). Rather, <b>"God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth that Your majesty is placed above the heavens"</b> ([Psalms 8:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.2)). The rightful place of God's majesty, the Torah, is in the heavens.

<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses:"Provide them</b> with <b>an answer</b> as to why the Torah should be given to the people."

Moses <b>said before Him: "Master of the Universe, I am afraid lest they burn me with the breath of their mouths"</b>.

God <b>said to him: "Grasp My throne of glory</b> for strength and protection, <b>and provide them</b> with an answer."

And from where is this derived? <b>As it is stated: "He causes him to grasp the front of the throne, and spreads His cloud over it"</b> ([Job 26:9](https://www.chabad.org/16428#v9)), <b>and Rabbi Naḥum said:</b> "This verse <b>teaches that God spread the radiance of His presence and His cloud over</b> Moses."

Moses <b>said before Him: "Master of the Universe, the Torah that You are giving me, what is written in it?"

</b> God said to him: <b>"I am the Lord your God Who brought you out of Egypt</b> from the house of bondage" ([Exodus 20:2](https://www.chabad.org/9881#v2)).

Moses <b>said</b> to the angels: <b>"Did you descend to Egypt? Were you enslaved to Pharaoh? Why should the Torah be yours?"</b>

<b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>"What</b> else <b>is written in it?"</b>

God said to him: <b>"You shall have no other gods</b> before Me" ([Exodus 20:3](https://www.chabad.org/9881#v3)).

Moses said to the angels: <b>"Do you dwell among the nations who worship idols</b> that you require this special warning?"

<b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>"What</b> else <b>is written in it?"</b>

The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>"Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it"</b> ([Exodus 20:8](https://www.chabad.org/9881#v8)).

Moses asked the angels: <b>"Do you perform labour that you require rest</b> from it?"

<b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>"What</b> else <b>is written in it?"</b>

<b>"Do not take</b> the name of the Lord your God in vain" ([Exodus 20:7](https://www.chabad.org/9881#v7)), meaning that it is prohibited to swear falsely.

Moses asked the angels: <b>"Do you</b> conduct <b>business with one another</b> that may lead you to swear falsely?"

<b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>"What</b> else <b>is written in it?"</b>

The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: <b>"Honour your father and your mother"</b> ([Exodus 20:12](https://www.chabad.org/9881#v12)).

Moses asked the angels: <b>"Do you have a father or a mother</b> that would render the commandment to honour them relevant to you?"

<b>Again</b> Moses asked: <b>"What</b> else <b>is written in it?"</b>

God said to him: <b>"You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal"</b> ([Exodus 20:13](https://www.chabad.org/9881#v13)).

Moses asked the angels: <b>"Is there jealousy among you,</b> or <b>is there an evil inclination within you</b> that would render these commandments relevant?"

<b>Immediately they agreed with the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> that He made the right decision to give the Torah to the people, and <b>as it is stated: "God our Lord, how glorious is Your name in all the earth"</b> ([Psalms 8:10](https://www.chabad.org/16229#v10)), <b>while "that Your majesty is placed above the heavens" is not written</b> because the angels agreed with God that it is appropriate to give the Torah to the people on earth.

מִיָּד כׇּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד נַעֲשָׂה לוֹ אוֹהֵב וּמָסַר לוֹ דָּבָר, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״עָלִיתָ לַמָּרוֹם שָׁבִיתָ שֶּׁבִי לָקַחְתָּ מַתָּנוֹת בָּאָדָם״ — בִּשְׂכַר שֶׁקְּרָאוּךְ ״אָדָם״, לָקַחְתָּ מַתָּנוֹת. אַף מַלְאַךְ הַמָּוֶת מָסַר לוֹ דָּבָר, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וַיִּתֵּן אֶת הַקְּטֹרֶת וַיְכַפֵּר עַל הָעָם״, וְאוֹמֵר: ״וַיַּעֲמֹד בֵּין הַמֵּתִים וּבֵין הַחַיִּים וְגוֹ׳״ — אִי לָאו דַּאֲמַר לֵיהּ מִי הֲוָה יָדַע?

<b>Immediately, each and every one</b> of the angels <b>became an admirer</b> of Moses <b>and passed something to him, as it is stated: "You ascended on high, you took a captive, you took gifts on account of man,</b> and even among the rebellious also that the Lord God might dwell there" ([Psalms 68:19](https://www.chabad.org/16289#v19)). The meaning of the verse is: <b>In reward for</b> the fact <b>that they called you man</b>, you are not an angel and the Torah is applicable to you, <b>you took gifts</b> from the angels. And <b>even the Angel of Death gave him something,</b> as Moses told Aaron how to stop the plague, <b>as it is stated: "And he placed the incense, and he atoned for the people"</b> ([Numbers 17:12](https://www.chabad.org/9945#v12)). <b>And</b> the verse <b>says: "And he stood between the dead and the living,</b> and the plague was stopped" ([Numbers 17:13](https://www.chabad.org/9945#v13)). <b>If</b> it were <b>not that</b> the Angel of Death <b>told him</b> this remedy, <b>would he have known</b> it?

<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When Moses descended from</b> standing <b>before the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> with the Torah, <b>Satan came and said before Him: Master of the Universe, where is the Torah?</b>

<b>He went to the sea</b> and asked: Where is the Torah? <b>And</b> the sea <b>said to him: "It is not with me."</b>
