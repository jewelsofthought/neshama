- The absurdity of the Torah Laws, (perhaps including the Oral Torah) which had been given at Sinai, were then obeyed by the generation that wandered in Sinai. Why and how could they obey them, if there, for instance, was no Temple? How could they keep the Laws of Kashrut if they were receiving manna from heaven, that would be by its very nature, kosher? They had no need for work, as they had food and their clothes needed no mending. I wonder if there tents and other materials did.
- In a sense the laws were given to a generation who were unable to practice them!
- What did the livestock eat during these wanderings in the desert? They were not able to grow, nor harvest grains. Nor did they have need for them - except as animal food. Also the livestock must have increased significantly if no-one was eating the meat. And why would the people not eat some of their livestock, at least, if there were getting bored of eating the magical manna?
- During that period, they must have lost a significant amount of useful skills, as besides having no need of them, they would not have time to set up shop, and teach their children any of their skills. So the bricklayes, and potmakers, the leatherworkers, and blacksmiths... all were gone!
- Thus the generation that entered would know little of such arts. If you think this is unlikely. That knowledge of that nature is not lost in a generation, just look at our children. Children that no longer read books, or know how to do arithmetic, etc. Within one generation think of the skills that have been lost, especially in the move from one technology to another. Try and find a skilled mason today. If we ever need to use horse and cart for our main source of transport, we will be in serious trouble, as there are not enough people who know who to make the leather bridles and saddles, etc that will be needed.

- There is no mention of water here either...
