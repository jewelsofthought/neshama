_When you go to war upon your enemy…and you will see in captivity a woman of beautiful appearance and you will desire her…You shall shave her head and make her [pare her] nails…she shall remove her garb of captivity and…mourn for her father and mother for thirty days… [only then can you marry her]… (Deut. 21:10-14)_

So begins our Torah portion. This essay explores the deeper and personal meaning of "a woman of beautiful appearance" and the inner significance of shaving the head and cutting the nails. On the literal level, this law addresses the inevitable occurrence during war of a soldier's desiring to marry one of the captive women.

The soul of man is made up of two general parts: one that remains beyond and above the body and one that is enclothed within it. The first aspect does not undergo the process of Divine concealment administered to the second aspect. Thus it remains aloof from the body and is not affected by its distorted view of reality. This part of the soul is called _mazal_, as in the saying, "although he does not see it, his _mazal_ sees it."

Ravina commented: Learn from this that one who becomes frightened for no apparent reason, it is because, though he did not see it (the cause for his fear), his _mazal_ did see it.

In other words, although a person is not consciously aware of his _mazal_, he is affected by what the _mazal_ experiences. Thus if the mazal is afraid, the person will be afraid. If the mazal is inspired, the person will inexplicably feel inspired.[^1] The _mazal_, therefore, because of its superior vision, guides the person through certain decisions, causing him to choose the path that will best serve his ultimate purpose.[^2]

It is called _mazal_, a word that can connote "flowing," since the energy of the _mazal_ flows to the aspect of the soul that inhabits the body.

The _mazal_ aspect of the soul is referred to as _yefat to'ar_, "beautiful appearance." Beauty is produced by the coming together of various elements. One color does not create beauty. It is the convergence of various colors that creates beauty. Similarly, the _mazal_ receives its energy from a number of Divine elements and is therefore related to the _sefira_ of _tiferet_.

The aspect of the soul that inhabits the body is called "a woman of beautiful appearance," being that it is the recipient of the beauty of the higher aspect of the soul.

In Kabbala, female symbolizes reception, while male symbolizes giving.

Hence she is referred to as a woman in captivity, since the lower aspect of the soul is, so to speak, held captive by the mental and emotional chains of the bodily perspective.

So when a person "desires her"--he truly wishes to free the imprisoned soul from its captivity, he must "shave her head" and "cut her nails."

<h3>Extreme Filter</h3>

The Torah's attitude towards hair is seemingly conflicted. The Nazir's hair is holy; the Levite in the desert had to shave his hair. The beard and _payot_ (the sideburns of a man's beard) should not be touched; a woman's hair must be covered. The hair of the leper and the "_yefat to'ar_" must be shaved; the hair of Samson was the source of his strength.

In the supernal worlds as well we find this paradox. The "hair" of _Atika Kadisha_ is the source of life for all worlds.

[_Atik_, "ancient," or "detached" refers to the sphere that is beyond the order of creation. In _Atik_, the Zohar says, "there is no left side"--it is beyond the source for concealment. The "hairs of _Atik_," though, i.e., the energy of _Atik_ extremely filtered, serve as the source of creation. For creation can only come into being through the concealment of the Divine.]

The hair of _Nukva_ (malchut), by contrast, is a source of vitality for negative energies.

Hair represents extreme filtering of vitality, _tzimtzum_. A person therefore experiences no pain when his hair is cut. The energy found in the hair is the "surplus of the brain." Therefore, the source of the hair or "surplus," will determine whether the hair is positive or negative.

The "surplus" of the brain of a mystic, what is called "foolishness" and a "joke," contains deep wisdom. As the Talmud comments—on the verse in Psalms (1:3), regarding the righteous, its leaf does not wither--"The mundane talk of scholars should be studied." (Sukka 21b) Even the leaf of the righteous, which is subordinate to the main thing, the fruit, is substantial and does not wither. Similarly, his "mundane" talk, which is subordinate to his principal wisdom, is substantial and requires analysis.

On the other hand, the "brain surplus" of the average person, his _shtut_, or joke or mundane talk does not contain any wisdom and in fact distracts him from Divine consciousness.

Similarly, the "hair" of _Nukva_, the extreme filtering of _malchut_, which is the lowest _sefira_ and is within the order of creation, allows for the sustenance of negative forces.

Thus the hair of the _Nazir_ (or the beard and _payot_ of any man), which derives its energy from _Atika Kadisha_, as the _Arizal_ writes in parashat _Naso_, should not be cut.

The hair of a woman, by contrast, which derives from _Nukva_ of _Atzilut_, must be covered, since it can allow for the sustenance of negative forces.

The Tzemach Tzedek also compares hair to a parable. The parable is an indirect expression of the principal wisdom and allows a person of lower understanding to perceive the wisdom of a great sage, which would otherwise be inaccessible. A metaphor given by a fool, or even one whose wisdom is not profound, is empty words, since the idea can be conveyed directly.

On a personal level, the hair of the captive soul, which must be shorn, refers to the scattering of the soul's energies—its mind and heart—to worthless endeavours. This is the "surplus" of the soul, which must be cut off in order for the soul to reconnect with its higher aspect, its _mazal_.

A person must also cut off "the nails," i.e., the surplus of the hand, which is called _chesed_. The hand is used to do kindness. When this is accomplished, the soul's energies are redirected entirely through the fulfillment of Torah and _mitzvot_ and it is freed from its captivity.
