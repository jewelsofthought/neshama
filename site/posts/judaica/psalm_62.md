לַמְנַצֵּ֥חַ עַֽל־יְדוּת֗וּן מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִֽד׃
For the conductor; on Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

- Although (truly) to Elohim absolute silence my soul from You(pl) my salvation.

אַ֣ךְ אֶל־אֱ֭לֹהִים דּֽוּמִיָּ֣ה נַפְשִׁ֑י מִ֝מֶּ֗נּוּ
יְשׁוּעָתִֽי׃
Truly my soul waits quietly for God;
my deliverance comes from Him.

_My soul waits in absolute silence for God,
for my salvation can only come from Him._

Truly he is my rock and my deliverance,

אַךְ־ה֣וּא צ֭וּרִי וִישׁוּעָתִ֑י מִ֝שְׂגַּבִּ֗י לֹא־אֶמּ֥וֹט רַבָּֽה׃
Truly He is my rock and deliverance,
my haven; I shall never be shaken.

_He is my rock, my foundation,
and I shall never be shaken_

עַד־אָ֤נָה ׀ תְּה֥וֹתְת֣וּ עַל־אִישׁ֮ תְּרָצְּח֢וּ כֻ֫לְּכֶ֥ם כְּקִ֥יר נָט֑וּי גָּ֝דֵ֗ר הַדְּחוּיָֽה׃
How long will all of you attack a man,
to crush him, as though he were
a leaning wall, a tottering fence?

אַ֤ךְ מִשְּׂאֵת֨וֹ ׀ יָ֥עֲצ֣וּ לְהַדִּיחַ֮ יִרְצ֢וּ כָ֫זָ֥ב בְּפִ֥יו יְבָרֵ֑כוּ וּ֝בְקִרְבָּ֗ם יְקַֽלְלוּ־סֶֽלָה׃
They lay plans to topple him from his rank;
they delight in falsehood;
they bless with their mouths,
while inwardly they curse. Selah.

אַ֣ךְ לֵ֭אלֹהִים דּ֣וֹמִּי נַפְשִׁ֑י כִּֽי־מִ֝מֶּ֗נּוּ תִּקְוָתִֽי׃
Truly, wait quietly for God, O my soul,
for my hope comes from Him.

אַךְ־ה֣וּא צ֭וּרִי וִישׁוּעָתִ֑י מִ֝שְׂגַּבִּ֗י לֹ֣א אֶמּֽוֹט׃
He is my rock and deliverance,
my haven; I shall not be shaken.

עַל־אֱ֭לֹהִים יִשְׁעִ֣י וּכְבוֹדִ֑י צוּר־עֻזִּ֥י מַ֝חְסִ֗י בֵּאלֹהִֽים׃
I rely on God, my deliverance and glory,
my rock of strength;
in God is my refuge.

בִּטְח֘וּ ב֤וֹ בְכׇל־עֵ֨ת ׀ עָ֗ם שִׁפְכֽוּ־לְפָנָ֥יו לְבַבְכֶ֑ם אֱלֹהִ֖ים מַֽחֲסֶה־לָּ֣נוּ סֶֽלָה׃
Trust in Him at all times, O people;
pour out your hearts before Him;
God is our refuge. Selah.

אַ֤ךְ ׀ הֶ֥בֶל בְּנֵֽי־אָדָם֮ כָּזָ֢ב בְּנֵ֫י־אִ֥ישׁ בְּמֹאזְנַ֥יִם לַעֲל֑וֹת הֵ֝֗מָּה מֵהֶ֥בֶל יָֽחַד׃
Men are mere breath;
mortals, illusion;
placed on a scale all together,
they weigh even less than a breath.

אַל־תִּבְטְח֣וּ בְעֹשֶׁק֮ וּבְגָזֵ֢ל אַל־תֶּ֫הְבָּ֥לוּ חַ֤יִל ׀ כִּֽי־יָנ֑וּב אַל־תָּשִׁ֥יתוּ לֵֽב׃
Do not trust in violence,
or put false hopes in robbery;
if force bears fruit pay it no mind.

אַחַ֤ת ׀ דִּבֶּ֬ר אֱלֹהִ֗ים שְׁתַּֽיִם־ז֥וּ שָׁמָ֑עְתִּי כִּ֥י עֹ֝֗ז לֵֽאלֹהִֽים׃
One thing God has spoken;
two things have I heard:
that might belongs to God,

וּלְךָֽ־אֲדֹנָ֥י חָ֑סֶד כִּֽי־אַתָּ֨ה תְשַׁלֵּ֖ם לְאִ֣ישׁ כְּֽמַעֲשֵֽׂהוּ׃ {פ}
and faithfulness is Yours, O Lord,
to reward each man according to his deeds.

Lyrics:
VERSE 1
When the enemy surrounds and my heart grows faint within
When the darkness overwhelms and my fears are pressing in
I will trust in You, O Lord, in the silence I will wait
I will stand upon Your Word

CHORUS
You're my solid rock and my salvation
My steadfast hope that won't be shaken
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

VERSE 2
You're my stronghold and my shield in the midst of every threat
Though the wicked never yield, they will vanish like a breath
Yes, I know the outcome's sure, Satan's evil plans will fail
In Your power I'm secure

CHORUS 2
You're my solid rock and my salvation
My steadfast hope that won't be shaken
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You
You're my comfort when I feel forsaken
My refuge and my sure foundation
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

VERSE 3
This is love I can't explain, this is mercy unreserved
Through Your sacrifice so great, I have peace that's undeserved
For the battle has been won, and I fear no shame or loss
Now the sting of death is gone

TAG
Pouring out our hearts before You
We will trust in You
Perfect Savior, strong defender
We will trust in You

For the leader on Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

Truly my soul waits quietly for God;
my deliverance comes from Him.

_Oh God, in the silence of my soul,
You are my salvation_
_My rock and my foundation,
my refuge, that shall never be shaken._

_When will you cease assailing a man,
hoping to crush him as though he were a wall leaning
against a cast-down fence._
_You plan to topple him from his rank;
You delight in lies, blessing with
your mouths, while cursing inwardly. Selah_

Truly He is my rock and deliverance,
my refuge; I shall never be shaken.

How long will all of you attack a man,
to crush him, as though he were
a leaning wall, a tottering fence?

They lay plans to topple him from his rank;
they delight in falsehood;
they bless with their mouths,
while inwardly they curse. Selah.

_Wait quietly for G-d, Oh my soul,
for my hope comes from Him._
_You are my salvation
My rock and my foundation,
my refuge, that not be shaken._

Truly, wait quietly for God, O my soul,
for my hope comes from Him.

He is my rock and deliverance,
my haven; I shall not be shaken.

_Only on God do I rely, for He is
my rock and my refuge._

I rely on God, my deliverance and glory,
my rock of strength;
in God is my refuge.

_Always place your trust in Him, people,
open your hearts to Him,
for G-d is your true refuge. Selah_

Trust in Him at all times, O people;
pour out your hearts before Him;
God is our refuge. Selah.

Men are mere breath;
mortals, illusion;
placed on a scale all together,
they weigh even less than a breath.

Do not trust in violence,
or put false hopes in robbery;
if force bears fruit pay it no mind.

One thing God has spoken;
two things have I heard:
that might belongs to God,

and faithfulness is Yours, O Lord,
to reward each man according to his deeds.
