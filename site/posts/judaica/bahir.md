## Verse 84

Note 84 in Aryeh Kaplan’s translation and commentary on the Bahir, or Book of Illumination or Splendour, one of the three seminal books of Jewish Kabbalah. The note says that the expression “Arms of the World”, **זְרֹעֹ֣ת עוֹלָ֑ם**, appears in Deuteronomy 33:29:

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
מְעֹנָה֙ אֱלֹ֣הֵי קֶ֔דֶם וּמִתַּ֖חַת זְרֹעֹ֣ת עוֹלָ֑ם וַיְגָ֧רֶשׁ מִפָּנֶ֛יךָ אוֹיֵ֖ב וַיֹּ֥אמֶר הַשְׁמֵֽד׃
</p><p>
(Sefaria) The ancient God is a refuge, A support are the [arms everlasting]. He drove out the enemy before you By His command: Destroy!
</p><p>
(Mercava) A dwelling for the God of old; and below are the <b>arms of the world</b>; and He drove out the enemy from before you and said, Destroy.
</p><p>
(Mechon-Mamre) The eternal God (who) is a dwelling-place, and underneath are the <b>everlasting arms</b>; and He thrust out the enemy from before thee, and said: 'Destroy.'
</p><p>
(Lesser) Thy refuge is the eternal God, and here beneath, the <b>everlasting arms</b>; and he thrust out the enemy from before thee; and he said, Destroy.
</p><p>
(JPS) The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the <b>everlasting arms</b>: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.
 </p>

This is a perfect example of the subtle differences in translations that can be found. Always a book is written about these verses has to choose one translation, according to the author's interpretation, and that is the one we will read.

Here I just wanted to give some idea of the variation in meanings of the key words in this verse, just to give you some feeling for the possible divergence of translations. That is why, when reading it in the original language, the reader naturally understands (or feels) the various subtleties involved, whereas the "foreign" reader, will understand it with the subtleties and peculiarities of his own culture and language.

**Note**: Two points:

 1. This does not make any sense as written.
 2. Perhaps the _vav_’s, as conjunctives, would mean that all the phrases that make up the sentence are equal.

Let us investigate further:

- A dwelling (refuge) of the ancient, or previous, god
- Below the arms of the world
  - Where (with which) He drove out (removed, exiled) the enemy from before you (from your face)
- He said, “Destroy”.

For you [said], “**HaShem** is my refuge,” you made the Most High your home.

There is more to be said, which I can cull from Sefaria and its commentaries. The sense of the everlasting arms, and other interesting additions. . .

This is part of a larger piece, where Moses is departing from this earth, and he is blessing the Children of Israel. ֹֹLooking at Deut. 33:26-29:

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
אֵ֥ין כָּאֵ֖ל יְשֻׁר֑וּן רֹכֵ֤ב שָׁמַ֙יִם֙ בְעֶזְרֶ֔ךָ וּבְגַאֲוָת֖וֹ שְׁחָקִֽים׃
</p><p>
O Jeshurun, there is none like God, Riding through the heavens to help you, Through the skies in His majesty.
<p dir='rtl'>
מְעֹנָה֙ אֱלֹ֣הֵי קֶ֔דֶם וּמִתַּ֖חַת זְרֹעֹ֣ת עוֹלָ֑ם וַיְגָ֧רֶשׁ מִפָּנֶ֛יךָ אוֹיֵ֖ב וַיֹּ֥אמֶר הַשְׁמֵֽד׃
</p><p>
The ancient God is a refuge, A support are the arms everlasting. He drove out the enemy before you By His command: Destroy!
<p dir='rtl'>
וַיִּשְׁכֹּן֩ יִשְׂרָאֵ֨ל בֶּ֤טַח בָּדָד֙ עֵ֣ין יַעֲקֹ֔ב אֶל־אֶ֖רֶץ דָּגָ֣ן וְתִיר֑וֹשׁ אַף־שָׁמָ֖יו יַֽעַרְפוּ טָֽל׃
</p><p>
Thus Israel dwells in safety, Untroubled is Jacob’s abode, In a land of grain and wine, Under heavens dripping dew.
<p dir='rtl'>
אַשְׁרֶ֨יךָ יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל מִ֣י כָמ֗וֹךָ עַ֚ם נוֹשַׁ֣ע בַּֽיהוָ֔ה מָגֵ֣ן עֶזְרֶ֔ךָ וַאֲשֶׁר־חֶ֖רֶב גַּאֲוָתֶ֑ךָ וְיִכָּֽחֲשׁ֤וּ אֹיְבֶ֙יךָ֙ לָ֔ךְ וְאַתָּ֖ה עַל־בָּמוֹתֵ֥ימוֹ תִדְרֹֽךְ׃
</p><p>
O happy Israel! Who is like you, A people delivered by the LORD, Your protecting Shield, your Sword triumphant! Your enemies shall come cringing before you, And you shall tread on their backs.
Da'at Tevunoth 102
<p dir='rtl'>
(נח) אמר השכל - אפרש לך יותר הקדמתי זאת, ותביני ענין עמוק; וכן תביני מאמרם ז"ל (ב"ר סח, ט), "הוא מקומו של עולם ואין העולם מקומו":
</p><p>
102. (58) Said the Intellect - I will explain to you more in this introduction, and you will understand a deep idea; and similarly you will understand their saying may they be blessed (Breisheet Rabbah 68:9), "He is the place of the world and the world is not his place":
<p dir='rtl'>
הנה, אין שום דבר מוכרח המציאות אלא מציאותו ית', וכל הנמצא זולת זה אין לו מציאות אלא בחפצו ית', ונמצא תלוי ועומד רק ברצונו ית'. ועל כן נקרא, שכל המציאות המצוי תלוי במאמרו ית', כענין מה שאמרו במים העליונים (ב"ר ד, ג; תענית י ע"א) וכענין זה אמרו ז"ל (חגיגה יב ע"ב), "הארץ על מה עומדת - על העמודים וכו', וסערה תלויה בזרועו של הקב"ה". וכן אמרו עוד (ילק"ש ח"א, תתקסד), "בשר ודם למטה ממשואו, אבל הקב"ה למעלה ממשואו, שנאמר (דברים לג, כז), ומתחת זרועות עולם". המשילוהו בזה כאילו הוא תומך כל המציאות בכל פרטיו, והוא עומד עליהם מלמעלה:
</p><p>
103. Behold, there is nothing that necessitates existence except for His existence (may He be blessed), and everything that exists except for that has no existence except through His desire (may He be blessed), and we find that it is dependent and stands only through His will (may He be blessed). And therefore we read, that all existence which is found is dependent on His word (may He be blessed), like the matter which they said with regard to the upper waters (Breisheet Rabbah 4:3, Taanit 10a) and like the matter that they said may their memory be for a blessing (Chaggigah 12b), "The land upon what does it stand - upon the pillars...", "... and the wind hangs upon the arm of the Holy One blessed is He". And similarly did they say further (Yalkut Shimoni section 1, 964), "...flesh and blood are under their load, but the Holy One blessed is He is above his load as it says (Deuteronomy 33:27), and the world is beneath his arms". He compared it as if he supports all that exists in all its details, and he stands upon them from above.
