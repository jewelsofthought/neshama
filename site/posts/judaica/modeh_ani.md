> החזרתי בי נשׁמתי
> "You returned my soul to me"

This is an expression of the Triune nature of our conscious existence.

The internal being, the external skin, or husk, and the Eternal that surrounds it.

'You' (G-d) returned my 'soul' to within 'me', meaning within my 'body'.
The body referred to here is not really mine, but was provided to me by G-d.

Is there a 4<sup>th</sup> element here? For the question that turns here, is who am 'I' that is having this morning experience? Who is the one praying? It is not 'You, G-d', it is not my body, though it does the praying. The only conclusion that I come to here, is the I am the soul that is the impetus here. Not the You, and not the body.

So this is my response:

"I am of the angels, descended from the realm of the _Elohim_."

The soul that is between is also of the angelic realm, known as _Ruach_, and the 'I that "I am" here is my _Nefesh_, my vivifying soul. The "identification" of the upper soul, the one that is connected to the Infinite Oneness, _Neshamah_ is attained through the portal of the mystery of _Ruach_. My journey is from the bondage of the manifestation of soul, _Nefesh_, contained by and in my physical being, to the alpha of me, the one who stands at the gate representing the first emergence from the luminous Oneness that is the source of creation, my _Neshamah_.

_B'Sh_.
