<h4>The Blessing upon Arising</h4>

</div>

<p style="font-style: italic">"In the service of the Almighty, the point of departure is Modeh Ani"<br />
-- Rabbi Sholom Dov Ber of Lubavitch
</p>

<p><strong>WHEN WE AWAKEN IN THE MORNING,</strong> G-d graciously restores our soul (<i>nefesh</i>)within us in order to experience another day of life.
<p>

</div>

Every morning we recite the _Modeh Ani_ blessing. It is both a blessing and a prayer of faith.

It is a lovely prayer, and a lovely reminder.

_"Returning **my soul** within **me**"_ is also an expression of the [Triune](/posts/qkab/trinity) nature of our conscious existence. Going slower and in more detail, it is read as **You**, God, return **"my soul"** to **"me"**, meaning within my 'body'. The body referred to here is not really mine, but was provided to me by G-d.

Who is the "I", that possesses a soul that needs to be "returned" to its body?

What we have is the expression of the Divine (King) who returns a soul to a body. Here is Spirit, Soul and Body, and an additional fourth element, the **"me"** in the **"my soul"**. For the "I" that is referred to here is not "**You**, God", neither am I the soul, nor the body that is praying. Although I am all of that too.

This is my response:

> "I am of the angels, descended from the realm of the _Elohim_."

The **"You"** are the angels, from the realm of _Elohim_. The soul that is returned is the "vivifying" soul, my _Nefesh_, the one that "gives" life to the body. The "I" is know as the  _Ruach_, the wind that blows between the soul that "rests" in the manifest realm, my _<nefesh_, and the upper soul that
the expression of the Breath of the Infinite Oneness, my _Neshamah_.

_B"shem_.

<div class="poem">

I am the ray of supernal light,
the light that casts no shadow
entering the space of constraint.
I am the expression of the God-head
in the body of Creation.
I am the awakening. I am Me,
God, experiencing Myself.

I am myself, knowing nothing.
I am everything, knowing my Self.
I am that other that also Sees me.

I am perverse, needing what is
not God to experience God.

I am covered, with a skin
so thick, so embalmed am I
in the density of my incarnation
the white noise of my present presence,
that I forget
that I am God.
and have so embraced the other
that I have become an-other,
"separate",
a self &mdash; the
"I" am

with a name,
believing, nay
knowing, that it has been
separated from the Mother
who nurtured
me from before my conception

that I can experience the very God
that I am… will be…
and always was.
