## <i>Da'at Tevunah</i> 58

### Deep Idea

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
 (נח) אמר השכל - אפרש לך יותר הקדמתי זאת, ותביני ענין עמוק; וכן תביני מאמרם ז"ל (ב"ר סח, ט), "הוא מקומו של עולם ואין העולם מקומו":
</p>
<p>

58:1] Said the Intellect - I will explain to you more in this introduction, and you will understand a deep idea; and similarly you will understand their saying, may they be blessed[^1], "**He is the place of the world and the world is not his place**":

</p>

### * His Existence

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
הנה, אין שום דבר מוכרח המציאות אלא מציאותו ית', וכל הנמצא זולת זה אין לו מציאות אלא בחפצו ית', ונמצא תלוי ועומד רק ברצונו ית'. ועל כן נקרא, שכל המציאות המצוי תלוי במאמרו ית', כענין מה שאמרו במים העליונים (ב"ר ד, ג; תענית י ע"א) וכענין זה אמרו ז"ל (חגיגה יב ע"ב), "הארץ על מה עומדת - על העמודים וכו', וסערה תלויה בזרועו של הקב"ה". וכן אמרו עוד (ילק"ש ח"א, תתקסד), "בשר ודם למטה ממשואו, אבל הקב"ה למעלה ממשואו, שנאמר (דברים לג, כז), ומתחת זרועות עולם". המשילוהו בזה כאילו הוא תומך כל המציאות בכל פרטיו, והוא עומד עליהם מלמעלה:

<mark class="orange">58:2 Behold, there is nothing that necessitates existence except for His existence (may He be blessed), and everything that exists except for that has no existence except through His desire (may He be blessed), and we find that it is dependent and stands only through His will (may He be blessed). Therefore we read that all existence which is found is dependent on His word (may He be blessed), like the matter which they said with regard to the upper waters[^4] and like the matter that they said may their memory be for a blessing,[^5] "The land upon what does it stand - upon the pillars...", "... and the wind hangs upon the arm of the Holy One blessed is He". Similarly did they say further,[^6] "...flesh and blood are under their load, but the Holy One, blessed is He, is above his load" as it says[^7], "and the world is beneath His arms". He compared it as if He supports all that exists in all its details, and He stands upon them from above.</mark>

### Bereishit Rabbah 68:9

"And he came upon (_vayifga'_) the place".[^1a] Why do we substitute the name of the Holy Blessed One and use Place? Because God is the Place of the world, and the world is not the place of God.[^1b]

From what is written "Here there is a place with Me",[^1d] the Holy Blessed One is the place of the world and the world is not the place of the Holy Blessed One. From "The ancient God is dwelling" [^1f] we do not know if the Holy Blessed One is the dwelling of the world or if the world is the dwelling of the Holy One, but from what is written "**Hashem**, You are a dwelling" we see that the Holy Blessed One is the dwelling of the world and the the world is not the dwelling of the Holy One.[^1g]

 It is he prayed. He prayed on the place, the place of the _Beit Hamikdash_. The first ancestors fixed three Prayers. Avraham fixed the morning prayer, as it is written "Next morning, Abraham rose to the place where he had stood before",[^2c] and the term stood can only be Prayer, as it is written "And Pinchas stood and prayed".[^2d] Yitzchak fixed the afternoon prayer, as it is written "And Isaac went out to converse in the field toward evening"[^2e] and the term converse can only be Prayer, as it is written "I pour out my conversation before God".[^2f] Yaakov fixed the evening Prayer, as it is written "And he came upon the place" and the term _vayifga'_ can only be Prayer, as it is written "As for you, do not pray for this people, do not raise a cry of prayer on their behalf, do not _tifga'_ Me; for I will not listen to you."[^2g] and the text also says: "If they are really prophets and the word of **Hashem** is with them, _ifge'u_ **Hashem** of Hosts"[^2h].[^2j]

Three times the day changes. At evening, a person needs to say "may it be Your will, **Hashem** my God, that you will bring me from darkness to light." At morning one needs to say "I thank you **Hashem** my God, that you brought me from darkness to light." In the afternoon a person needs to say "may it be Your will, **Hashem** my God, that just as I merited to see the sun rise, may I merit to see the sun set."[^3c]

### Bereishit Rabbah 4:1-3

> "And God said 'let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters'".

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יְהִי רָקִיעַ, כְּתִיב (תהלים קד, ג): הַמְקָרֶה בַמַּיִם עֲלִיּוֹתָיו, בְּנֹהַג שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם מֶלֶךְ בָּשָׂר וָדָם בּוֹנֶה פָּלָטִין וּמְקָרֶה בַּאֲבָנִים וּבְעֵצִים וּבְעָפָר, אֲבָל הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא לֹא קֵרָה אֶת עוֹלָמוֹ אֶלָּא בְּמַיִם, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: הַמְקָרֶה בַמַּיִם עֲלִיּוֹתָיו.
</p>
  <p>

v1. And God said, "Let there be a firmament" - It is written (Psalms 104:3), "Who lays the beams of his upper chambers in the waters." It is the custom of the world that a king of flesh and blood constructs a palace and makes a roof for it out of stones and wood and dirt. But the Holy One Blessed Be He made a roof for his world out of water, as it says "Who lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters."

</p>

v2. "Let there be a firmament" means "let the firmament (_raqi'a_) solidify", like the thin plates of gold (_vayeraq'u_) in Exodus 39:3. The middle liquid layer solidified, and the lower heavens were formed, and the heavens above the heavens, the upper ones [were formed]. Their works on the first day were liquid and on the second they were solid.

How did it solidify? The fire came forth from above and dried the surface of the firmament, making its surface gleam. For it says: "By His breath [meaning fire] the heavens are smoothed" (Job 26:13). The work of creation came to teach about the giving of the Torah, and the teaching was revealed through it: "As when fire kindles the parts” (Isaiah 64:1)—its halves. When did the fire split between the upper and lower [heavens], is it not when the Torah was given!? Thus it was at the creation of the universe.

The rabbis said:
regarding this in the name of Rabbi Chanina,
but Rabbi Pinchas and Rabbi Jacob the son of Rabbi Avin said this in the name of Rabbi Samuel son of Nachman:

"~ the middle liquid layer solidified, and the lower heavens were formed, and the heavens above the heavens, the upper ones [were formed]".

Rab said "their works on the first day were liquid and on the second they were solid.

"Let there be a firmament"
  [means] let the firmament solidify".

Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Simon said
  "~ [means] let a thin plating be made for the firmament (_raqi'a_), just as you see it said:
   "and they beat thin (_vayeraq'u_) the plates of gold" (Exodus 39:3)".
Rabbi Chanina said:
 "the fire came forth from above and dried the surface of the firmament [solidifying it]".
Rabbi Yochanan came to this conclusion with this verse:
  "By His breath [meaning fire] the heavens are smoothed (Job 26:13)."
He used to say: "Rabbi Chanina taught me well".
Rabbi Yudan the son of Rabbi Shimon said
  "the fire went forth from above and it made the surface of the firmament gleam".
R. Berakhyah, R. Yaakov bar R. Avina in the name of R. Abbah bar Kahana said:
  "The work of creation came to teach about the giving of the Torah, and the teaching was revealed through it: "As when fire kindles the parts” (Isaiah 64:1)—its halves. When did the fire split between the upper and lower [heavens], is it not when the Torah was given!? Thus it was at the creation of the universe.Thus it was at the creation of the universe."

v3. "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters" [means] "between them and in the middle of them". As the empty space that is between the earth and the firmament, so there is an empty space between the firmament and the upper waters. [It is] like the flickering of candles, and [its] fruits are the rain waters
