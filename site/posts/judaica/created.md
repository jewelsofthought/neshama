1. Created heaven & earth

   - earth: unformed and void
   - darkness on the face of the deep
   - spirit of G-d hovered over the face of the waters
   - no mention of creation of water
   - spirits (water), earth & darkness

2. _Let_ there be light

   - _divided_ light from darkness
   - so the first light contained light and darkness
   - what was the source of this light?
   - mentions day & night, evening and morning... but there was no sun or moon.

3. (_Let_) firmament (רקיע) ִin the midst of the water (which was not "created", but was just there)

- _divided_ water from water
  - mystery of the water
  - water of the flood
  - water of the 4 rabbis
  - waters above and waters below
- evening and morning (no sun, no moon)
  - separation of water $$\equiv$$ creation of light

4. _Let_ waters below gather
   - _let_ the dry land emerge
   - _let_ earth bear grass, herbs and seed, fruit trees and fruit and seed.
     - seed (life) cycle
     - 1st seeds then are the sun and the moon.
5. _Let_ lights (signs) of the firmament of heavens
   - Not waters of heaven
   - water
     firmament - lights (sun, moon, stars)
     water - seeds
   - for seasons, days and years
   - for light upon earth
   - divide light from darkness
     - already did that, so what light is being referred to "in the beginning"?
6. _Let_ waters swarm

   - _Let_ fowl fly (open firmamanet of heaven)
   - created sea monsters - deep
   - creepeth in waters - middle
   - be fruitful and multiply - upper

7. _Let_ earth bring forth
   - living creatures (נפשׁ חיה)
     - cattle, creepers, beast (x3)
     - G-d made beast, cattle, creepers (x3)

_Let us make_

- image
- descend
- fish of sea
- fowl of air
- cattle and earth
- creepers
- created man and in His image
  - male and female (like light) created them.
- blessed them
  - be fruitful and multiply
  - replenish the earth
  - subdue the earth
  - dominion over
    - fish $$\rightarrow$$ water
    - foul $$\rightarrow$$ air
    - creepers $$\rightarrow$$ earth
  - given all for food.
