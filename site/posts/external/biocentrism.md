## Biocentrism

In 2007, one scientist claims to have discovered a theory within quantum physics that provides and explanation for death and afterlife. Dr. Robert Lanza, developed the theory of biocentrism which states that the existence of life and biology are central to being, reality and the cosmos—our consciousness. In essence, it is that life creates the universe, rather than the other way around. Dr. Lanza uses the famous ["double-slit test"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc) to illustrate his point: the double slit test is an experiment of light and matter which found that it can display characteristics of both waves and particles&mdash;it’s behaviour changes depending on the observer’s perception and consciousness&mdash;quite an unexplained phenomenon of quantum physics! Dr. Lanza asks "Why does our observation change what happens? Answer: Because reality is a process that requires our consciousness." He claims that this experiment would explain the quantum effects of the afterlife and supports the many reports of afterlife experiences by people who have died, visited another realm and lived to tell about it.

One such supporter of this theory is Dr. Eben Alexander, whom cannot scientifically explain his experience visiting heaven when he was clinically brain dead from meningitis, thus making it scientifically impossible to generate any neurologic activity and brain function. Yet, he had such a powerful afterlife experience that he has lived to tell. He said, "My journey deep into coma, outside this lowly physical realm and into the loftiest dwelling place of the almighty Creator, revealed the indescribably immense chasm between our human knowledge and the awe-inspiring realm of God." He goes on to state, "The brain itself does not produce consciousness. It is, instead, a kind of reducing valve or filter, shifting the larger, nonphysical consciousness that we possess in the nonphysical worlds down into a more limited capacity for the duration of our mortal lives." (_Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey Into the Afterlife_, 2012) While Dr. Lanza’s theory is not widely embraced by fellow scientists, his discovery in conjunction with quantum physics certainly could shed light on God’s promise of eternal life to those who believe (John 3:16). As the Bible so beautifully explains in 2 Corinthians 4:18 "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."
