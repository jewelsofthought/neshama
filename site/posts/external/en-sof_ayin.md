The whole offering, which symbolises the _Shekhinah_, the Divine Presence, ascends to **Binah**, which, in the world of the _sefirot_ is the Holy of Holies. The attachment of the human will to God is determined by the concentrated intention of the person bringing the offering.

All attachment, unification and completion is secreted in that secret which cannot be perceived or known, and which contains the will of all wills, _En-Sof_. _En-Sof_ cannot be known, and does not produce end or beginning like the primal _Ayin_ (nothing), which does bring forth beginning and end.[^4]

What is beginning? The supernal point, **Ḥokmah**, the beginning of revelation. **Ḥokmah** is the beginning of all, concealed and resting with thought. It can be dimly perceived by thought, for it is divine Thought, the source of thought in the lower worlds. And it produces end, **Malkut**, which marks the final stage of the _sefirotic_ world, and is called “The end of the matter” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). But there are no end, no wills, no lights, no luminaries in _En-Sof_. Its nature is uniformly one, from every point of view for there is no differentiation within _En-Sof_. All the luminaries and lights depend on it for their existence. The _sefirot_, which are the lights of the Godhead, are maintained by the influence that descends from _En-Sof_. Yet they are not in a position to perceive _En-Sof_, which is concealed even from the perception of the _sefirot_. That which knows, but does not know, is none but the Supernal Will, the secret of all secrets, _Ayin_. Only **Keter**, the supernal will, has knowledge, albeit a faint knowledge, of the nature of _En-Sof_. And when the supernal point and the world to come, **Binah**, ascend they know only the scent, like someone who inhales the scent, and is perfumed by it.

[^4]: The concealed essence of _En-Sof_ does not reveal itself in the _sefirot_ as “beginning” or “end”. The _sefirot_ are the self-extension of **Keter**, which is also called _Ayin Kadmon_ (primal nothing). This is also beyond the boundary of perception; but the perceptible _sefirot_ have emanated from it.</span>
