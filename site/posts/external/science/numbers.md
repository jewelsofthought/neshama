## Mathematics

An **[irrational number](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IrrationalNumber.html)** is any [real number](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RealNumber.html) that is not a [rational number](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RationalNumber.html)&mdash;that is, it is a number which cannot be expressed as a fraction $$m/n$$ where $$m$$ and $$n$$ are [integers](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Integer.html), with $$n$$ non-zero. Equivalently, irrational numbers are real numbers that cannot be represented as simple fractions. As a consequence of [Cantor](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georg-Ferdinand-Ludwig-Philipp-Cantor)'s proof that the real numbers are [uncountable](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CountablyInfinite.html) (and the rationals countable) it follows that almost all real numbers are irrational. Perhaps the best known irrational numbers are $$\sqrt{2}$$, [$$\pi$$](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-number-pi-3-141592654-3126451) and [$$e$$](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-number-e-2-7182818284590452-3126351) and $$phi$$.

When the [ratio](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-ratio-definition-examples-2312529) of lengths of two line segments is irrational, the line segments are also described as **incommesurable**, meaning that they share no measure in common. A _measure_ of a line segment $$I$$ in this sense is a line segment $$J$$ that "measure" $$I$$ in the sense that some whole number of copies of $$J$$ laid end-to-end occupy the same length as $$I$$.

A [transcendental number](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TranscendentalNumber.html) is a number that is not [algebraic](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicNumber.html), that is, not a solution of a non-constant [polynomial](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polynomial.html) equation with rational [coefficients](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Coefficient.html), The most common examples of transcendental numbers are $$\pi$$, and $$e$$ and $$\phi$$. Less known are $$e^\pi$$ and $$2^\sqrt{2}$$. Only a few classes of transcendental numbers are known, for it is extremely difficult to prove that a given number is transcendental.

<div class="note">
It is possible to think of the irrationals as being traceable. There is a line that one can follow to arrive at that point that is not a point, but referred to as a neighbourhood. It is, essentially, a zero-dimensional point, a point that one only reaches when one spans infinity. Yet there is a line, a function by which they can be approached, and one will be able to determine their neighbourhood(s).

Transcendental numbers cannot be traced in this way. They just are. In a sense, they emerge from a deeper spacae, a deeper knowing. Using the one example all of us are familiar with, $$\pi$$, which we acknowledge as a "force of nature". As something that was always there. $$e$$, which many of you will be unfamiliar with, is termed the "natural" logarithm, and is the centre beam of logarithms. It has "smooth" characteristics&mdash;according to the mathematicians&mdash;and as such aid in reducing the complexity of many equations that deal with logarithms, or exponential, expansion or contraction&mdash;such as inflation, or you bond.

Transcendental numbers can be viewed as those which cannot be precisely identified to the point where the next number in the sequence can be known from the previous numbers in the sequence.

> The inexactitude of the transcendental numbers and other factors may be essential to the structure, evolution and maintainance of the universe.
