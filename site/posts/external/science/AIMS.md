Quantum gravity is based on the Theory of Realitvity.
Gravity as geometry.
Moving from $$ 2^D \rightarrow 3^D $$
$$ 2^D = \triangle = 180^o $$
$$ 3^D = \triangle = 270^o $$
In curved space, the sum of the angles of the triangle are $$720^o$$, which is too many.

Equations that produce metric from metric have angle.
Geometry: A recipe to measure lengths.
Straight lines in curved surfaces seem to interact (if || they will come together)
Particles move on shortest path possible (geodesic)

Quantum Field Theory

$$3^D$$ : we can use $$2^D$$ calculations to calculate where particle is and where it will be (classical physics).

Probability Theory

Laplace: Philosophical essay on probability
Paradox:

- conflict between reality and what
- forces arise from particle exchange
- occurs at well-defined place in spacetime
- leads to divergences (infinities) $$\rightarrow$$ not fundamental, but emergent.
- not good for gravity

Quantum Electrodynamics

"lines" - particles
"vertices" - intersection

Macro: Force in gravity: general relativity: geometry
Micro: Force in QFT: particle exchange: cannot violate gravity; lots of parameters, conceptually challenging.

{Driven by belief in G-d, or disbelief too.}
Waves in water $$\rightarrow$$ same as quantum waves.
Black hole = edge of the universe {Why not opposite as well?}

String Theory $$\rightarrow$$ point like particles like little loops.
Inherent in the description of the the string is its interactions.
Strings sing: pluck a string, produce different notes.
Closed string = gravity (9 space dimensions + 1 time dimension) $$\rightarrow$$ super-gravity.
Open string = other 3 forces; more symmetric version of EM. (Yang-Mills)
QFT: no gravity
String theory needs to incorporate gravity.
$$ L = 10^{-34}m $$ ( $$ \lt 10^{-18}$$ ) which is the smallest we can see. {Not with the naked eye, but with the correct equipment. So what is it that we are "seeing"?}
Only with the above constraints (super-gravity & super-symmetry) is the tension of the string as it is stretched constant. {This constancy is a human need}

Closed string moving creates a cylinder;<br />
Open string rotating creates cylinder with gravity and EM.
p-banes: closed strings (p = dimensions c)
o-banes: open strings
