## Reality

> 2 Corinthians 4:18 "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."

<div class="note">

{Note: The two statements: "Reality is a process that requires our consciousness", and "How quantum physics proves G-d's existence" are both arrogant statements. Firstly, G-d has no need for us to prove His existence. In fact, our very existence is proof of His existence! And whatever reality we propose, the reality of G-d's creation is self-evident. There could be no mind, no consciousness questioning such reality if it were not for G-d having created such a being.

This is expounding one of the modern explanations of quantum "reality", that "consciousness produces reality". Then what has produced this consciousness? And what is the "reality" that this consciousness is conscious of?}

## Biocentrism

Dr. Robert Lanza, developed the theory of [biocentrism](https://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/galleries/how-quantum-physics-proves-gods-existence.aspx) which states that the existence of life and biology are central to being, reality and the cosmosâ€”our consciousness. In essence, it is that life creates the universe, rather than the other way around. Dr. Lanza asks "Why does our observation change what happens? Answer: Because reality is a process that requires our consciousness."

<div class="note">

That is not a correct answer, because it is always dealing with our perception of reality. In other words, what we observe changes according to our observation. The example here would be eye-witness testimony that differs according to where and what perspective the witness was experiencing at that time.

</div>

One such supporter of this theory is Dr. Eben Alexander, who while clinically brain dead, had an experience visiting "heaven". "My journey deep into coma, outside this lowly physical realm and into the loftiest dwelling place of the almighty Creator, revealed the indescribably immense chasm between our human knowledge and the awe-inspiring realm of God." There are obviously infinite realms that are G-d's, and not of human experience.

> He goes on to state, "The brain itself does not produce consciousness. It is, instead, a kind of reducing valve or filter, shifting the larger, nonphysical consciousness that we possess in the nonphysical worlds down into a more limited capacity for the duration of our mortal lives." (_Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey Into the Afterlife_, 2012).

This is what I wished to share from this piece. Our experience of reality is one in which we live in a reduction of the totality of the Creator's mind.

TODO: Needs to go somewhere else. Is a lovely piece though.
