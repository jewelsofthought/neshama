The only eternal moment, that which is both in and out of time, is the present, held always, as if hanging in limbo between the future, pregnant with possibility, and the past, as solid and already written. Because we cannot see the future, but always exist in the present because of a past that has occurred, that has already been written, we project that which we know into the future, and speak of a future destiny that is already determined &ndash; i.e., as if it has already been written.

"The soul as the place of time"

"The locus of ... time is in the immaterial soul and not in external matter".

Augustine, Husserl - The phenomenology of time.

"Inability to conceive of time in the absence of a narrative."

"To taste eternity" when one's heart is "still flitting about in the realm where things change and have a past and a future" proves futile.

"Every existant being must be either that which truly is or ontically dependent on that which truly is."

"The eternal must be immeasurable, the absolute timeless as opposed to the unendingly time-bound."

"Spacialisation of time: 'conscious duration' and 'real motion' are replaced ... by the mathematical point that has been created."
