<div class="poem">

Each and every day, and each and every moment
When you recite Holy before Me,
Teach them to lift
Lift their eyes to the firmament,
Corresponding to your space of prayer
When you say before Me: Holy.
Teach them that there is no greater joy
in your world that I have created
But that moment when your eyes meet my gaze
And my eyes are looking into your eyes
And you say before Me: Holy.
The voice emerging from your mouth
In that moment pushes it away
And ascends before Me like the scent of the aroma.
Bear witness to them
of the Truth you see in Me,
which is engraved upon My Seat of Glory,
for when you say before Me, Holy,
I bend down over it, clasp it, embrace it, and kiss it,
and My hands are on its arms, thrice daily,
when you say before Me:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€˜Holy, Holy, Holy.
