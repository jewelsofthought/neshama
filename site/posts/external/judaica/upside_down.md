# The Upside-Down World

Reb Nachman and Reb Shimon were sitting together on the bank of a lake, discussing the Mysteries of the Chariot. Shimon said, "Reb Nachman, how is it possible to travel from one world to the next?"

Reb Nachman said, "Shimon, look at that tree on the other side of the lake."

Shimon did this.

Then Reb Nachman said, "Now look at the shadow of that tree in the water."

Shimon looked at the shadow of the tree and he saw that he was peering into another kingdom, an upside-down world, where all the forests were inverted. He noticed that the shadow of the tree also resembled an immense leaf. Then he noticed that the leaf resembled the wings of a bird. And then Shimon realised he was flying on the back of the bird, and cities were whirling by, when he looked down and saw a jewel glowing in the darkness.

The jewel was Jerusalem, which he saw from a great distance. Ahead was the Garden of Eden. The bird came down into the Garden, and he saw three angels standing around a well, and one by one they came and drew water and poured it out into three vessels, one of wood, one of clay, and one of stone.

From the wood grew a tree that gave birth to a woman who grew ripe; and from the clay the angels formed the features of the first man to see her face and from the stone they carved a seat, and sat back for centuries, waiting for the wind.

After he had watched for what seemed ages, Shimon walked over to the well, leaned over the side, and looked down. There in the well he saw a shadow that resembled the wings of a bird. Then he noticed that the shadow also resembled the shape of a leaf. Then he saw that the leaf also resembled the shadow of a tree. He looked up and found himself sitting on the bank of the lake, beside Reb Nachman.

Reb Nachman said, "Does that answer your question?"
