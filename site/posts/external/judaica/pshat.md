### <i>Peshat</i>

<div class="box has-text-centered">

_ein mikra yotze midei peshuto_ &mdash; “A verse cannot depart from its plain meaning.”[^1]
</div>

This well-known statement of the Talmud is cited time and again by modern scholars to prove that however great was the predilection of the Rabbis [of the Talmud] for midrashic and homiletic[^2] expositions of the Bible, They were nevertheless fully aware of the fact that the _peshat_, the plain meaning, was the definitive one.

A study of the relevant sources, however, reveals the remarkable but undeniable fact that whatever the Rabbis meant by the word _peshat_, it is something quite different from the meaning which is given to it today, i.e. the plain literal meaning of the verse, the meaning which its author intended to convey.

It seems that Rashi was the first of the rabbinic commentators to sharply distinguish between _peshat_ and _derash_, and we have unthinkingly applied this meaning to the talmudic use of the word. Such a distinction did not arise in earlier ages. The Rabbis knew and practised but one method of biblical interpretation. To that method the name of Midrash was given, whether _Midrash Halakhah_ or _Midrash Haggadah_, and the latter included both what we know today as _peshat_ and what we think of as “midrashic.” If, as will be shown, they did distinguish between _peshat_ and the other interpretation, that distinction was not between the literal and the homiletic meanings.

In point of fact, it is only in such passages as the above-mentioned phrase is found that it is possible, although not unexceptional, to find the world _peshat_ with its current meaning.  

The clearest example is regarding the bearing of arms on Shabbat. One view is that it is permitted, according to the verse “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 mighty one. (It is) thy glory and thy majesty” (Psalms 95:4). The objection is that “this verse refers to the words of the Torah,” i.e., the Torah is Israel’s weapon of defence and glory. To which the response is _eyn mikra yotze midei peshuto_. Clearly the _peshat_ of the verse, as we understand the word today, is that a sword is a sword (_Shabbat_ 63a).

Another example, when the Talmud applies the word _to’evah_, referring to the divorced woman who marries her first husband after having been divorced from her second, to the _sotah_ (a woman suspected of infidelity). It then queries whether in view of the fact that _ein mikra yotze medei peshuto_, it can still refer to the remarried divorcee also  (_Yevamot_ 11 b). A similar view is expressed later, in _Yevamot_ 24a, the _peshat_ of Deut. 25:6-7 being taken to mean that the son born of the levirate marriage shall be given the actual name of deceased.

More common, however, than the sentence _ein mikra yotzei midei peshuto_ is the phrase _peshatei dikra bemai ketiv_ &mdash; to what does the _peshat_ of this verse refer? Here the difficulty begins, Let us consider the first example, Proverbs 23:1-2 reads, “When sitting to dine with a ruler, consider that which is before thee, And put a knife in thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite.” Rashi’s explanation is a model of what we know as _peshat_. Omitting his explanation of individual words, it reads, “When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider carefully with whom you are sitting, and whether he is well or ill-disposed towards you. If you see that he is ill-disposed do not eat his food if you art sensible. If you art hungry and desirous of eating, rather put the knife between your teeth.” After that exposition of the _peshat_, Rashi, as is his wont, adds “And our Rabbis have given the midrashic explanation (_darshu_) that the reference is to a disciple sitting before his master, etc.” It is an excellent example of the distinction made by Rashi, and since accepted, of the difference between _peshat_ and _derash_.

    Pondering these verses, verse 1 is clear, "When sitting to eat with a ruler, consider well who you are sitting with (who is before you). However, verse two is more concerning. The translation given here is "Put a knife in your throat if you are a man (of, or) given to appetite.". 

    That may be the accepted translation, but referring to the Hebrew, those are not the words I find, but rather "Put a knife at (or in) your throat, [אִם־בַּ֖עַל נֶ֣פֶשׁ אָֽתָּה]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _"if you possess a soul!"_

    Interestingly enough, all the commentaries (of which there were only a few available on Sefaria) are based on Rashi's interpretion of [נֶ֣פֶשׁ]{dir="rtl"} as "appetite". 
    
    It also has the following meanings: "soul, self, life, creature, person, appetite, mind, living being, desire, emotion, passion;" "living being (with life in the blood), that which breathes, the breathing substance or being, soul, the inner being of man, the man himself, self, person or individual, seat of the appetites, of emotions and passions;" 

      <div class="box">    

        Alshich 23:2 says: "That rather than corrupting your own soul, it would be better to put the knife to your own throat."

        Metzudat David 23:2 says: ["אם בעל נפש אתה. אם יש לך נפש משכלת למאוס ברע:]{dir="rtl"} _"You despise if you have a_ nefesh _if your_ nefesh _is sophisticated."
      </div>
    </div>
  Basically, in modern language, it says be discerning when sitting with a ruler. If your soul objects to the ruler's food, rather stick a knife down your through, than any of the impure food he offers.

This _derash_ is found in the Talmud.[^4] R. Meir had sent R. Simeon b. Eliezer to buy some wine from the Samaritans, in the belief that it was ritually proper. An old man accosted R. Eliezer and quoted this verse to him, from which R. Meir properly understood that the wine was forbidden. The Talmud then states that the _peshat_ of the above-mentioned verse refers to a disciple sitting before his master. If he knows that the master can answer any question which he puts to him, he should inquire, but if not, rather than embarrass him, he should seek another teacher.

It is thus clear that that self-same explanation which is specifically called (by Rashi) _derash_ is equally explicitly called _peshat_ by the Talmud.

A similar reply is given to the same question in another passage of the same tractate. On page 13 we read that for certain reasons R. Safra refused to eat the Priestly Portion proffered to him by Raba. In a dream there came to R. Safra the verse “As he, that takes away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that sings songs to a heavy heart.”[^6] R. Safra understood from this that he had not acted rightly.[^7] The Talmud then continues, “Abaye said to Raba, ‘What does the _peshat_ of this verse refer to?’ and he replies ‘It refers to a teacher who teaches an unworthy pupil,’ The ‘heavy-hearted’ person is the unworthy disciple to whom it is useless to ‘sing the song of the Torah’.”

It would be possible to suggest that to the Rabbis the whole of Proverbs consisted of instruction from teacher to disciple, on the well-known basis that “disciples are called sons and teachers, fathers”[^8] &mdash; incidentally an interpretation which properly belongs to _peshat_ and not _derash_. Thus the whole book of Proverbs could have been applied, as these two verses are, to the relationship between master and disciple, bringing it within the wide framework of _peshat_.

Alternatively it might be suggested that the Rabbis took the word _Mishlei_ in its talmudic connotation of “Parables,” and with parables the _derash_, the application of the verse in a sense other than the literal, constitutes the _peshat_!

Such attractive explanations, however, cannot possibly be put forward with regard to the third and most remarkable example which is herewith adduced. The passage in question[^9] is discussed in _Ketuvot_ 111b. Commenting on the words _osri lagefen iroh_, R. Dimi said, “there is not a grapevine in the Land of Israel which will not need the inhabitants of a whole city to harvest it.” In further exposition of the verse, he states that the wine would be suitable even for those advanced in years (reading _leven shanim_ instead of _leven shinayim_).

Now whatever one may say about the far-fetched nature of this interpretation, it must be conceded that it is at least an elaboration of the literal meaning of the verse which speaks of wine.

The Talmud continues, however, with the now stock question what is the _peshat_ of the verse? And the same R. Dimi, who gives the above explanation, gives as the _peshat_, “The Congregation of Israel says to the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Lord of the Universe! Wink to me with your eyes which will be sweeter to me than wine, and show me your teeth which are sweeter to me than milk.'” And that constitutes the _peshat_ in contrast to the previous verse which is presumably _derash_! After that striking example, it is unnecessary to cite the other passages (_Kiddushin_ 80b, _Eruvin_ 23b and _Arakhin_ 8b) where the deviation from what we know as _peshat_ is not so striking.

There is therefore no doubt whatsoever that the word _peshat_ in the Talmud had an entirely different connotation than it has since been given and it involves a rethinking of the sentence _eyn mikra yotzeh midei peshuto_. But if it did not convey the sense of the literal meaning, what did it convey?

The original meaning of _peshat_ is “to stretch forth” and is most commonly found in the phrase, “stretching forth the hand” (e.g. _Mishnah Shabbat_, 1:1). From that primary meaning it is an easy transition to its secondary one, “to straighten” and thus “to make plain.” It is in this sense that it comes to mean “to explain the Scriptures,” but to explain them by “stretching forth,” i.e, by giving a full and detailed exposition, or by studying them thoroughly. Thus we find the contrast between _lamad_ as superficial learning and _pashat_ as intensive study. In Ex. R. 47:8, on the verse, “He did neither eat bread nor did he drink water”, (Ex. 34:28), the Midrash says, “but of the bread of the Torah he did eat, and of the water of the Torah he did drink. He did learn the Torah by day and _poshet_ it to himself during the night. And why did he do so? In order to teach the children of Israel that they should toil in the Torah by day and night.”

A similar meaning of intensive study is given in a revealing passage in the _Tanchuma_ (Jethro 15): It happened that R. Akiba was invited by the _chazzan_ to read publicly the Scriptural lesson, but he declined. Whereupon his disciples said to him, “Our Master! Didst thou not teach us, ‘For it is thy life and the length of thy days?’ Why didst thou refuse to go up?” He replied, “The only reason I refused to go up was because I had not gone over the reading two and three times, and no one is permitted to read the Torah publicly until he is _poshetit_ to himself two and three times.”

In these passages _poshet_ has the meaning of extending the study of the Scriptures by repeating it over and over. It equally applies to extending the study by expounding it, and in this connection it is noteworthy that, in contrast to the current meaning, it is clearly found as synonymous and completely interchangeable with its present opposite, _derash_.

Thus, when Gen. R. (10:5) has _Rav Yanai hayah yoshev vedoresh_, the identical passage in the _Tanchuma Chukkat_ is introduced with the words, _Rav Yanai haya yoshev u-poshet_.

In the Jerusalem Talmud the word _pashat_ is found where we would expect _derash_, as in the passage (T.J. Shabbat 16 [15c]), “Rabbi and R. Hiyya Rabba and R. Ishmael b. R. Jose were sitting and _poshtim_ in the Scroll of Lamentations on the eve of Tisha Be-Ab.” The most conclusive evidence, however, is provided by a passage in _Yerushalmi Horayot_ 3 (48b).[^16]

Rabbi Chanina ben Chama saw all the people of Sepphoris hastening to the Bet Hamidrash of R. Benaiah. Inquiring about the reason, he was told that his disciple, R. Yochanan, _yativ ve’doresh_ (was sitting and expounding). Whereupon R. Chanina blessed God for having vouchsafed to him to see the fruits of his labors during his lifetime, since _ve’khol agadata poshte leih chutz mi-Mishley, ve’Kohelet_ (he [R. Chanina] had taught him [R. Yochanan] all of Aggadah [with the exception of that pertaining to the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes]).

In this passage the word _poshet_ is explicitly applied to Aggadah and R. Yochanan is a _doresh_ of what R. Chanina used to _poshet_ to him. _Peshat_ thus stands as a synonym of _derash_. And the only possible meaning which can be given to it in the Talmud is “the usual, accepted traditional meaning as it was generally taught.” Thus when an _Amora_ came with an original interpretation which differed from that traditional one, the Talmud asks what that _peshat_, the usual meaning was. But in that meaning there was no distinction between what we call today _peshat_ and _derash_.

The difficult word here is חַכְלִילִ֥י - _chachlili_ - a very poetic word. _Rashi_ translates it simply as red, _"his eyes are red_". He quotes [Proverbs 23:29](https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.23.29), "who has redness of eyes?" Redness of eyes is associated with wine because that is what usually happens to those who drink much wine — their eyes become red - _chachlili_.

But the meaning is elusive. _Ramban_ associates the word with the painting of the eyes, _kachalt_ from [Ezekiel 23:40](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.23.40). He takes a slightly more metaphorical approach, claiming [from Proverbs 23:29] that the word _chachliluth_ is to be read _kachliluth_ (paint) and that the meaning of the verse is "that the drunkard has his eyes painted by wine and he cannot hide his drunken state". Thus "_they that tarry long at the wine_ (Proverbs 23:29), since the wine dims their eyes, causing them to tear, _and be consumed away in their sockets_ (Zechariah 14:12), making it necessary for them to have their eyes constantly painted.” Scripture, in the book of Proverbs, is thus speaking of the disgrace of wine and the external evils of contentions and wounds which befall he who drinks it in abundance, while in his house there will always be the cry of “Woe” and “Alas” (Proverbs 23:29).
