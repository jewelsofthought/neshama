## Kindness and Ecstasy

### The collapse of God's project

> When men began to increase on earth and daughters were born to them, the divine beings saw how beautiful the daughters of men were and took wives from among those that pleased them. The Lord said, "My breath shall not abide in man forever, since he too is flesh; let the days allowed him be one hundred and twenty years."—It was then, and later too, that the _Nephilim_ appeared on earth —when the divine beings cohabited with the daughters of men, who bore them offspring. They were the heroes of old, the men of renown. The Lord saw how great was man's wickedness on earth, and how every plan devised by his mind was nothing but evil all the time. And the Lord regretted that He had made man on earth, and His heart was saddened. The Lord said, "I will blot out from the earth the men whom I created —men together with beasts, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I regret that I made them." But Noah found favour with the Lord. (6:1-8)

God's decision to "blot out" the whole of creation {Note: Only it was not the "whole of creation", but essentially the living beings, and the creeping animals} follows on an account of births and deaths over ten generations, culminating in the birth and naming of Noah. The central event of each generation is the birth of the significant heir; the father's years are numbered before and after this pivotal act of propagation. Intense expectation builds up, therefore, in this objective account of numbers and names, an expectation that becomes explicit when the reason for Noah's name is given by Lamekh, his father: "This one will provide us relief [_y'nahamenu_] from our work and from the toil of our hands, out of the very soil which the Lord placed under a curse" (5:29). <mark>That Noah's name is derived from the word _ne&#x1e25;ama_, "comfort," is in itself strange: etymologically, the word _noa&#x1e25;_, meaning "rest," would seem more appropriate;</mark> and, in fact, Rashi insists on treating _y'nahamenu_ as a pun on _yaniah mimenu_—"God will give us relief— from the labour of our hands." (Otherwise, as he points out, Noah should have been named Menahem!) There begins to be woven, therefore, a tissue of verbal plays on the words _noa&#x1e25;_, _na&#x1e25;em_: the comfort Noah will bring to mankind is the relief from a relation with nature that is misarticulated and, in some real sense, perverse. (Rashi: "Noah invented the plough—before his time, people would plant wheat and the earth would produce thorns and thistles.") <mark>Noah is therefore seen, at least by his father, as representing a readjustment of man's relation with the world</mark>; in effect, he will neutralize the primal curse on Adam.[^1] This is the human expectation; it is followed by Lamekh's and Noah's significant age-data, until the birth of Noah's three sons.

Chapter 6 begins with the cryptic description of the sexual relations of the "divine beings" with the "daughters of men" — including reference to the _Nephilim_, giants, heroes, men of renown. Only at this point does God, it seems, re-enter a drama of sexuality, procreation, and death in which human beings have been evolving their own destiny without comment from or dialogue with their creator. Even <mark>the function of creating man in His image has been taken over, apparently, by man himself: "When God created man, He made him in the likeness of God... When Adam had lived 130 years, he begot a son in his likeness after his image." (5: 1, 3)</mark>

<mark>Man replicates himself; in so doing, indirectly, he will replicate the divine image.</mark> That is the model suggested by Adam's first act of procreation after the sin. But the image of man is distorted. God "sees" that evil has swollen to enormous proportions (6:5,12). An act of divine perception occurs: no human being is capable of such an act, it seems. Man had desired the "knowledge of good and evil"; by now, <mark>he seems unaware of the evil that, ambiguously, he has both generated and suffers. Evil overshadows his life; he no longer knows, or can discriminate between, those radical opposites</mark> that Buber describes: "the fortune and the misfortune or the order and the disorder that are experienced by a person, as well as that which he causes."[^2] A kind of sensitivity is lost to man. At this point, God, with a terrible humour, quotes the word-play on Noah's name, subtly transforming the meanings and indulging in a positive flurry of puns. The root _na&#x1e25;em_, "comfort," which held out hope of comfort or relief, now denotes "regret," a radical revision of the entire Adam project (6:6). The curse, in which the relation of Adam to _adama_, "ground," had been skewed ten generations previously, was, in the human perspective, to have been lifted by Noah. When God acts on His vision of things, however, it seems that the curse is, instead, to be intensified to the point of utter destruction.

There is a clear sense that something problematic, even bizarre, is at work in the very use of language itself: the explosion of puns raises questions about limits and liberties, about structure and play. As we shall eventually see, this is a powerful issue: what does it mean to use language truly or wrongly? The shadow of catastrophe looms, even as language begins to display its resources.

The word God uses for destruction is _emh&#x1e25;eh_ — "I will blot out" (6:7). Rashi translates to different effect: "He is dust, so I shall bring water upon him and dissolve him." This is to be a watery destruction, not a dry one. The original dust-earth of man—his relation to the <i>adama</i>&mdash; is to be radically annulled by an overapplication, as it were, of water. It then transpires that man's destruction is also to be the destruction of all life — animal, reptile, and bird — again under the rubric of _ne&#x1e25;ama_ — the cosmic "regret" of the creative God. The root words, _na&#x1e25;em_, _noa&#x1e25;_, are joined in an associative cluster with the root _ma&#x1e25;ah_, "dissolution".

The last verse of Parshat Bereshit returns explicitly to Noah and evokes a fundamental unease about the relation of this one individual, who was to have given relief to a strained world, and the total destruction that God has just declared, in His own voice. The narrative voice takes over for a short, final half-verse: "And Noah found favor with the Lord" (6:8). _Noa&#x1e25; matza &#x1e25;en_ — the words _noa&#x1e25;_ and _&#x1e25;en_ form a palindrome, suggesting a subversive relation between the man and the "favour" he finds, the grace with which God sees him. So many expectations are being undermined; there is a kind of mirror-reflection of Noah that God sees and saves from the debacle. It is as though only by an imaginative act of vision can God decide to exempt Noah from the clearly stated general fate of the whole Adam project.

### The choice of Noah

There is a profound tension in this passage: in a sense, God declares an intention, based on a vision, and immediately revokes it, because of another vision of things. The tension is subtly reinforced by the fact that it is the narrative voice that seemingly undercuts the decisiveness of God's declaration —as though shrewdly making a comment on the emotional reservation of which God Himself is, as yet, unaware. A few verses later, this tension has surfaced in God's speech. He communicates it to Noah, in His first words to him: "I have decided to put an end to all flesh... Make yourself an ark of gopher wood" (6:13-14).

"An end to all flesh" could not be more unequivocal: it is qualified only by an augmentation — "I am about to destroy them _with the earth_." And yet there is the exception. Noah is at first not told the reason for his survival. Rather, God speaks of the technical details of the Ark, of a covenant that will cover his family and two of every living species, of food arrangements. It is only when God again speaks to Noah, telling him to board the ark he has already constructed, that an explanatory clause is added: "for you alone have I found [lit., seen] righteous before Me in this generation" (7:1).

The rationale is apparently simple and ethically reassuring. Noah is _different_ from his generation. They are full of evil, of violence; he is righteous. Buber, indeed, comments that he is the first human being to be described by any epithet. He is certainly the only human being in the entire biblical narrative to be described as "righteous"[^3] both in direct encounter with God and in the authoritative narrative voice that begins the Parsha: "Noah was a righteous man; he was blameless in his age" (6:9). The great emphasis on Noah's difference from his contemporaries serves an obvious moral purpose. It justifies his exemption from the universal disaster, and the choice of him to found a new race of Adam.[^4] In a creative project that has proved a total failure (the text harps constantly on totality, through the repetition of the word _kol_ "all"[^5]), there is yet one detail that can be salvaged and can provide a basis for a reworking of the idea. God's act in destroying and saving is seen to be ethically coherent: there is an unarguable logic to the ruthlessness of the artist who shreds all unsuccessful drafts and retains only the one that approximates his original intent.

But, close beneath the surface of the text, and glaringly exposed in many midrashic versions of the narrative, there is another reading. On this reading, Noah is chosen not because he is absolutely different, but because he "finds favour in the eyes of God." In what merit, asks the midrash, was he saved? The very question, with its multiple answers, is damning. In a famous comment, Rashi questions the qualifying phrase, righteous _in his generations_" Does this damn him with faint praise (only in his corrupt time did he look like a hero)? Or does it praise him for transcending the sociomoral pressures of his period? In either case, the full-blown epithet, "perfectly righteous," is subjected to a refracting process that troubles its immaculate surface.

Ultimately, the suggestion that Noah is saved more because of the grace of God than because of any intrinsic grace of his own being is unavoidable. _Midrash Tanhuma_ elaborates on this possibility:

> This is like one [_e&#x1e25;ad_] who was travelling along and saw another traveller [_e&#x1e25;ad_] and sought his company. To what extent? Till he formed bonds of love with him. That is why it says here, "Noah found favor." Compare this with "Joseph found favour in [Potiphar's] eyes" [39:4]. It is like one who was travelling along and saw another traveller and sought his company. To what extent? Till he gave him power... To what extent? Till he gave him his daughter... To what extent? Till he could tell which animal is to be fed at the second hour of the day, and which at the third hour of the night.[^6]

The traveller's choice of companion as narrated here is almost arbitrary. It is because He is One-alone-matchless that He seeks another one —any one —so that He may love, empower, and educate him. The anonymous hero, undeserving, finds himself married to the King's daughter. In many midrashic parables, the King's daughter is identified as wisdom. So, here, God chooses Noah, not because he has achieved significant wisdom or virtue, but because He seeks to convey to _some one_ the knowledge of Himself. The commoner marries the King's daughter. But what is the intention of the end of the midrash? The acme of wisdom that Noah attains is a knowledge of the feeding schedules of the animals in the ark! Is this bathos, a satiric comment on Noah's limitations, or a serious insight into the nature of the wisdom that God has to teach Noah?

At any rate, Noah's heroic status, his difference from his generation, is undermined. The ethical underpinning to God's choice becomes less clear. The most explicit shattering of ethical clarities, however, is to be found in Sanhedrin 108a: "Noah had a death sentence sealed against him. But he found favour in the eyes of God."[^7] In this reading, Noah is of a piece ith his generation. He is essentially included in God's "regret," _ne&#x1e25;ama_. Only love can invert Noah into few — an object of beauty: "you I _have seen_ as righteous before Me" (7:1).

Disturbing questions about God's dealings with human beings arise inevitably from such a reading. If Noah is not such an unequivocal _tzaddik_, if his election is not entirely on merit, then what is the ethical statement of the Flood narrative? Perhaps there were others like Noah who were destroyed in the cataclysm? The midrash does not evade such a possibility. Indeed, _Midrash Tanhuma_ goes so far as to construct an evolving model of individual justice; the rules of the game change when the Torah is given: "From the time that Israel stood before Mount Sinai and God gave them the Torah, any individual who sinned would be punished by God. Previously, one man might sin and the whole generation be punished. Of the generation of the Flood, our sages said that there were many decent people like Noah who were obliterated with the generation."[^8]

On this view, the giving of the Torah marks a turning point in God's relation with human beings. Now, every man is treated after his deserts; previously, God's dealings with mankind were summary and roughhewn. On such a view, however, there would be no motivation for a post-Sinai generation to read the Flood narrative at all. Beyond the purely historical interest, what is to be gained from such a reading? We read, says Paul Val&eacute;ry, to "acquire some power." If radical questions of evil and punishment are confronted in the narrative in ways that are no longer relevant, then our knowledge and power as readers are not significantly increased.

### The theological question

Moreover, in Rashi's reading, based on a plethora of midrashic sources, the Torah itself instructs the reader to read with a different assumption. In several passages, the Flood narrative becomes the epicenter of  
questioning about God's ways with mankind. The Flood remains a live issue; no statute of limitations has withered its relevance. Moses tells the people at the end of his life, in his final song: "Remember the days of old, consider the years of generations past" (Deuteronomy 32:7). Rashi  
comments: " 'Remember': What He did to those first people who angered Him. 'Consider': This refers to the generation of Enosh, when the ocean flooded them, and to the generation of the Flood, which _washed them away_ [_shotfam_]".

<mark>A people that does not read history and that therefore has no sense of the vast spectrum of possibilities within God's range is called a "dull and witless people" (Deuteronomy 32:6).</mark> Rashi unpacks the description: "They have forgotten what happened in the past, and therefore cannot understand the future: that He has the power to do good and to do evil."

The idea that history is to be read for the sake of the present and the future focuses on the Flood and its earlier warning version in the time of Enosh.[^9] And the main affirmation Rashi has to make about the Flood relates precisely to our question of individual justice (Deuteronomy 32:4):

> _"The Rock! His deeds are perfect"_: Even though He is strong, when He brings retribution on those who transgress His will, He brings it, not in a _flood_ [_shetef_] but with justice, for "His deeds are perfect."
> _"A faithful God"_: to recompense the righteous for their righteousness in the world to come. And although He may delay their reward, in the end He will fulfil His words.
> _"And without iniquity"_: Even to the wicked, He pays the reward of their righteousness in this world.

One of the basic theological questions is addressed here, the enigma of God's relations with mankind. Essentially, Rashi reads the verse as saying that _despite appearances_, ultimately (that is, from the perspective of the world to come), God is just to each individual. What may look like the neglect of the righteous, or the pampering of the wicked in this world, is "in the end" deciphered as coherent and morally just.

For our purposes, however, what is interesting here is the imagery implicit in the word _shetef_, "flood." God brings retribution not in one indiscriminate cataclysm, but with justice — that is, commensurate with the individual and his merits. The word _shetef_ implicitly evokes the Flood. It is the word that Rashi himself uses a few verses later, as we have seen, to describe the fate of the Flood generation: "He washed them away." On one occasion, at least, God did, quite literally, "wash away" an entire generation, a mass of people and animals and insects, and the very earth itself, to a depth of three handbreadths below the surface —as far as the plough of human (agri)culture could fathom.[^10] And Rashi, it seems, is inviting us to consider the questions raised by the apparently undiscriminating destruction exemplified by the Flood. Indeed, he insists that without such a searching reading, there is no way for the people to face essential problems of the present and future.

Rashi essentially affirms his faith in an ultimate justice, in spite of a world where His power is more apparent than His discrimination. What may look like _shetef_—the overpowering surge of mighty waters[^11] that washes away guilty and innocent alike — is to be seen in the total context of the world-to-come. But the problem of _shetef_ is not so easily dismissed by Rashi himself, nor indeed by his sources in the midrash. When God consigns the whole world to destruction, with the words "I have decided to put an end to all flesh" (6:13), Rashi comments: "Wherever you find sexual sin and idolatry, _andralamousia_ comes to the world and kills good and bad (indiscriminately)."

_Andralamousia_ is the term, borrowed from the Greek, for summary mass execution, the same notion as was indicated by the word _shetef_, "flood." Rashi here draws on the acknowledgment in many sources[^12] that there may indeed be a disaster in which individual merits are entirely ignored. In one midrash, Noah is the king's friend and therefore is sealed away in a prison, to exempt him from the general fate (_andralamousia_).[^13] On the other hand, there are many midrashic sources that stoutly deny any such possibility. Their message is clear: unlike a human king, who cannot discriminate between friend and foe, God saves the sterling individual, even as He punishes the corrupt masses. And the case of Noah is brought in evidence for this affirmation.[^14]

The anxiety generated by the question of God's discrimination and providence is expressed in Rashi's reading of the two most poignant complaints on this subject in the Torah. First, there is Abraham's passionate defence of Sodom: "Far be it from You, to do such a thing, to bring death upon the innocent as well as the guilty, so that innocent and guilty fare alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?" (18:25). Rashi comments: "Far be it from You!' It is a travesty of You! People will say, That is His usual work—He washes away everyone, righteous and wicked alike! That is what You did to the generation of the Flood and to the generation of the Tower of Babel."[^15]

Abraham here imagines what people will say. He projects a possible reading of the Flood narrative, in which God's character, what He habitually does, His "speciality" (lit., craftsmanship) is subject to fits of irrational and petulant anger. "Far be it from You!" Clearly, Abraham is as concerned for God's reputation as he is for the threatened city of Sodom. In one of Rashes sources, Abraham says: "This is a profanation of God —people will be held back by this from returning to You."[^16]

The interesting assumption here is that the Flood narrative has become a paradigm of interpretation in Abraham's time. People obviously are saying the kinds of things that Abraham projects here. In another midrashic version, Abraham does not, in fact, project the nihilistic view onto "people," but simply—though rhetorically—asks, "Is this not a travesty of You? Is this what You did to the generation of the Flood and to the generation of the Tower of Babel? This is not Your way."[^17] Here, Abraham is confronting an obvious reading of the Flood paradigm. On this reading, there is a grotesque consistency to God's arbitrariness: He acts true to character. "Master of the universe, far be it from You!... Let people not say, 'That is his usual work: He destroys the generations _in the mode of cruelty_. He destroyed the generation of Enosh and the generation of the Flood and of the Tower of Babel. He does not change from His usual work!'"[^18]

Twice, Abraham protests, "Far be it from You!" The second time, Rashi comments, "in the world to come." Such a view of God's relationship with human beings cries to high heaven: it affects not only what his contemporaries may say in their particular historical situation, but all future generations. Gur Arye translates "the world to come" here, as "in future generations." The Flood will never lose its potency to generate questions about _shetef_— about mass destruction and the relation of God to the individual. Wherever a similar situation recurs, the Flood paradigm will be cited, and people's darkest fears about their existential situation will be confirmed.

For the _shetef_ model, with its image of a cruel, undiscriminating God, will always have enough apparent evidence to support it. Gur Arye emphasizes that no proof of God's response to the individual can ever be convincing. Noah's survival, for instance, will be attributed to the need for the species to survive, and not to his personal affirmation of values different from those of his time. The Flood model of _shetef_ will be confirmed particularly by its triple occurrence as the basic mechanism of God's dealings with mankind. But perhaps, Gur Arye suggests, there are _specific_ reasons, in each of these generations, for the general destruction that is called _shetef_? In the case of the Flood, he refers to Rashi's cryptic assertion, quoted previously, that <mark>sexual sin results in indiscriminate disaster</mark>. We shall return to this notion later.

The second example of the Flood as a paradigm for mass, irrational destruction in the thinking of later generations is the midrashic reading of the episode involving Avimelekh and Sarah. Avimelekh has kidnapped Sarah, and God has spoken to him in a dream, threatening death for adultery. Avimelekh pleads ignorance: he was told Sarah is Abraham's sister, not wife; and, in any case, he has not touched her. According to the midrash, he cries to God: "Will You kill a righteous nation as well?" The unexpected word, "nation," in Avimelekh's protest of innocence suggests that his own case leads him to ask universal philosophical questions: "Even if he is innocent, will You kill him? Is that Your way—to destroy nations for no good reason? That is what You did to the generation of the Flood, and to the generation of the Tower of Babel. _I too say_ that You killed them for no good reason, as You intend to kill me" (Rashi, 20:4).

Rashi's source[^19] depicts Avimelekh as motivated by a deep sense of his own innocence. If he is to be condemned nevertheless, then he is forced to assume that, in the paradigm Flood situation, the victims must also have been innocent. He affirms absurdity in God's relations with mankind; his speech is a combined text, woven of his personal situation and his understanding of large historical and philosophical questions. In his thinking, there is little dialectical tension: "I too say" commits him squarely to an imagery of absurdity and cruelty.

The Flood, then, in its most radical imagery, becomes for all time a paradigm of the problem of God's dealings with man. Before we look more closely at Rashi's cryptic acknowledgment that <mark>where there is sexual sin or idolatry, mass indiscriminate destruction really does occur</mark>, it will be fruitful to consider again the _sheteff_ image. <mark>_Sheteff_ expresses the rash haste with which tyrants punish their populations.</mark> "When a king condemns his people, no one praises him, because they know that there is _shetef_— an angry surge of passion—in his judgment. _But God is not so._"[^20] <mark>Human beings, in a condition of shetef, become blind to individual differences and circumstances.</mark> There is a lack of _curiosity_ about this condition that is the very definition of cruelty. God is not like this, asserts the midrash: He can always maintain high moral ground in any questioning of His judgments.

It is undeniable, however, that the savage imagery of the _shetef_ is to be found in descriptions of God's dealings with the world. In Isaiah 28:18, for instance: "When the _sweeping flood_ passes through, you shall be its victims." And in Nahum 1:8: "With a sweeping flood, He makes an end of His place." And it is one of the most common ways in which the effects of the Flood are described in talmudic metaphor: all life is swept away, washed away (_nishtafin_). It is the violent surge that uproots trees and mountains, in Ramban's translation of "The waters swelled" (_va-yigberu_, Genesis 7:18).

<mark class="orange">_Shetef_ denotes a quantity of water—_mayim rabbim_<mark> — a force that leaves nothing intact.</mark> The word used in the Torah narrative to describe the effect of the waters — _ma&#x1e25;ah_, "dissolve" — indicates a return to the "watery" condition of the universe before Creation. Man, as we noticed in our previous chapter, was originally formed out of the judicious mixture of dust and water; he was kneaded like dough, by the divine Baker (Rashi, 2:6). All that is necessary to ruin the structure of his being is to infiltrate him with an excess of water: in this destruction, the apparent solidity of the flesh is melted, thawed, and dissolved. All identities disintegrate; "they were obliterated from the earth" indicates, according to Ramban, that there is even no memory of their ever having existed (7:23).</mark>

### The drama of language

In a powerful midrash,[^21] the primordial water acquires a symbolic force that will inform our understanding of the shetef modality:

> _"Let the waters be gathered into one area"_ [1:9] — Let there be a _limit_ (_kav_) to the waters, as it is said, "The measuring line is being applied to Jerusalem" [Zekhariah 1:16]. "Let the waters _hope_ [_y'kavvu_] for Me, for what I am about to do with them." This like a king who built a palace and settled dumb people in it. They would rise up early in the morning and greet the king in sign language. The king said, "If these dumb people rise early to greet me in sign language, how much better it would be if they could speak!" So the king settled speaking people in his palace. They rose up and took over the palace. They said, "This palace does not belong to the king, it belongs to us." So the king said, "Let the palace return to its previous state." So, in the beginning, God's praise rose up only from the water, as it is written, "From the voices of many waters." And what did they say? "God is majestic on high" [Psalms 93:4]. God said, "If these waters, which have no speech, praise Me, when man is created, how much more will he praise Me!" The generation of Enosh arose and rebelled against Him; the generation of the Flood rebelled; the generation of the Tower of Babel rebelled. God said, "Let these be removed, and let those who were here before come in their place."

The return to "wateriness" is a return to speechlessness. The drama of the generations leading up to the Flood and following it becomes a drama about language, about the paradoxes inherent in the human capacity to create symbol-systems; it is a drama about civilization and its discontents.
Apparently, the two modalities described here are those of language and silence: the waters are the dumb servants, while human beings are the articulate servants. And yet, <mark class="orange">a kind of inversion of values happens in the midrash. "From the voices of many waters" — dumb waters speak magnificently, giving ecstatic, unequivocal expression to the glory of God. Their very bodies speak. And the articulate — called _pik&#x1e25;im_, the intelligent (lit., with open mouths) —so misuse their power of speech that they can be considered as not having said anything. It is a natural consequence of what they do with language that the dumb waters replace them.</mark>

The paradoxes are acute: <mark>the waters express a total oceanic acquiescence to God's power, while the poignancy of man's power of language is that it represents a narrowed, filtered inspiration.</mark> (There is a "line" drawn to limit the power of the waters and to make human speech possible. But that very limit holds out "hope" to the waters that their retrenchment is only temporary.) <mark>To speak as human beings speak is to make choices at every level of articulation.</mark> Which particular version of reality is to be created through this selection of words? What is not to be said? Many things, many more than are to be said. <mark class="orange">How can any model of reality, expressed in any form of language, vie with the devastating power of the "voices of many waters"? And yet, it seems, God has expectations of human beings, in their verbal expressiveness and their intelligence. Theirs is the power that He wants, apparently. Their structures, their freedoms, whatever is separate, distinct, and limited in them, can express a consciousness of God more valuable to Him than the involuntary ecstasy of the waters.</mark>

<mark class="orange">The "rebellion" of the generation around the Flood can be understood as a failure to speak, to communicate with God —or, indeed, with each other. There is a pathology in the very "openness" (_pikhim_) of the Flood generation, which converts openness to a dumbness, a dumbness of babble rather than of silence.</mark>

### The exile of speech

One of the central midrashic motifs on the Flood is a quotation from Psalms 142:8: "Free me from prison [lit., from closedness] that I may praise Your name." Here is one version:

> [God said to Noah:] "Come out of the ark." David said, "Free my soul from prison." When Noah was in the ark, he prayed constandy, "Free my soul from prison," as it is said, "Therefore let every faithful man pray to You, in a time when You may be found, that the rushing mighty waters [_shetef mayim rabbim_] not overtake him" [Psalms 32:6]. God said to Noah, "It is decreed before Me that you shall not leave this prison [closed condition] till twelve months are up." So we find in Isaiah 49:8, "In an hour of favor I answer you... saying to the prisoners, 'Go free," For they [the people in the ark] were forbidden [lit., imprisoned] to have sexual relations. Why? Because <mark>when the world is in trouble and destruction, human beings are forbidden to procreate; so that there should not be a situation in which man is building while God is destroying.[^22]</mark>

In this complex and poignant midrash, Noah prays constantly in the ark.{<span class="note">Note: Closed ark; closed religious community of the faithful.</span>} He prays to be saved from the prison of his ark. That, at least, is our opening understanding of Noah's prayer. But the quotation from Psalms 32:6 forces us to realign our perspective on Noah's dilemma. <mark>Noah, like "every faithful man," prays to be saved from the "rushing mighty waters"</mark> — the expression combines _shetef_ with _mayim rabbim_ to communicate <mark>the undifferentiated dumb violence of the world just outside the prison of the ark</mark>. The prison is both the closed space of the ark and the too-great openness of the wild raging silence beyond. In his enclosure within the ark, he is, of course, saved from the waters, but the midrash emphasizes that, thus imprisoned, he shares the general "decree" against mankind. He is not exempted from the general malaise; he too must endure twelve months, immobilized by fear of both openness and closedness. In a final move, the prison is associated with sexual death, which expresses most intimately the breakdown of speech in the rushing mighty waters surrounding him.

That is, Noah shares with his generation a pathology that is called in kabbalistic sources "the exile of speech."[^23] And since "In every generation, there is something of the people of the Flood generation," [^24] this pathology is not unknown in the world since the Flood. <mark class="orange">A fundamental disaster has befallen the language powers of human beings. They have become so open that they are closed to one another. Communication between subjects has degenerated into a babble of indiscriminate voices. The silent compression of the ark (the _teiva_, meaning both "box" and "word") is the mirror image, the alter ego of the cacophony outside. Noah, man of his generation, endures the Flood, the misarticulation of openness and closedness, in an inversion of a deluge all his own.</mark>{<span class="note">Note: Also provides a solution to the cacophony of the world.</span>}

For what, after all, according to classic midrashic sources, was the pathology of the Flood generation? The almost formulaic expression for their sin is that they were _shetufim be-zima_—"awash with sexual sin." <mark>The sense of _shetef_, of undiscriminating passion that sweeps away all boundaries</mark>, is central to the life of the time. <mark>The "corruption of all flesh,"</mark> of which God speaks to Noah (6:12), <mark>is a profound disintegration of identity</mark> that is simply mirrored in God's declared intent to "disintegrate... all flesh" (6:13). The structures are already lost. According to Sanhedrin 108a, "cattle had perverse relations with wild beasts, wild beasts with cattle, everything with man, and man with everything." <mark>If sexuality is a mode of communication, then a sexual pandemonium has taken over. Something in the delicate balance of likeness and unlikeness that makes communication possible has been violently dislocated.</mark> In sending the Flood, the _shetef_ that deconstructs all differences, God is, in a sense, merely registering what human beings have made of themselves. Or, to put the point differently, the Flood is an objective correlative, in T. S. Eliot's sense, for processes that psychologically and spiritually have long been under way.

Relevant here is the tradition, which Rashi refers to, that the Flood was not a single cataclysmic event, but a process. When Enosh was born, <mark class="orange">"it was then that men began to invoke the Lord by name" (4:26). This is interpreted by Rashi to mean that people began to call human beings and natural phenomena by God's name. At that time, in other words, people lost the capacity to discriminate between God, man, and nature. <mark>A linguistic rigour was lost.</mark> And at that time, by no coincidence, "a third of the world was flooded by the overflowing ocean" (Rashi, 6:4). This can, of course, be read as sin and punishment; it can also be read as an objective correlative for the blunted distinctions and misarticulations, by which people then defined themselves and their place in the world.</mark>

There are several indications in midrashic sources that the Flood was a process that men and women knew to be under way. In a fascinating midrash, quoted by Rashi, for example, Lamekh's wives refuse to have sexual relations with him (to "speak" to him), under the plea that "Tomorrow the Flood will come and wash away everything" (Rashi, 4:24). The Flood is intimated in the lives of men and women and animals, before Noah's time. Lamekh's wives speak out of a sense of impending doom— quite literally, _apr&egrave;s moi, le d&eacute;luge_! They react to the catastrophic openness of their time by refusing speech, sexuality, entirely. What they affirm in doing this is that <mark>the apparent openness smothers life as fatally as any prison.</mark>

### Rapacious sexuality

At this point, it will be important to look more closely at the sin that precipitates the Flood, that is the Flood. There is a strange ambiguity in the midrashic account: on the one hand, Rashi defines the sin as sexual sin and idolatry ("And the earth was corrupted before God"); on the other, he defines it as robbery ("And the earth was filled with violence" [6:11]). The same ambiguity recurs when God speaks to Noah, but this time Rashi schematizes the situation that precipitates the Flood:

> <mark>_"An end of all flesh"_: Wherever you find immorality and idolatry, indiscriminate punishment— _andralamousia_ —comes to the world and kills innocent and guilty alike.</mark>

> _"For the earth is filled with violence"_: The divine decree was sealed against them only because of robbery (6:13).

The total indiscriminate destruction comes as a response to sexual sin and idolatry. But it is only because of robbery, disrespect for private property, that the edict is finally signed and sealed. What does Rashi intend here, when he aligns sexual immorality with idolatry as the essential factor, and <mark>robbery</mark> separately, <mark>as the final determinant?</mark> We might suggest that a comment is being made on the nature of the open sexuality and idolatry of the time, and on the mass destruction that is commensurate with it. <mark>For both sexual sins and idolatry often seem to be "generous" sins. In them, human beings often experience and express a yearning to transcend self, to relate to the other. It is no etymological coincidence that incest and other sexual taboos are called _&#x1e25;esed_.[^25] This is the modality of expansiveness, impatient of limits and laws, eager to speak many languages, and know many other selves.</mark>

<mark class="orange"><mark>But the midrashic comment on the sexuality of the Flood generations reveals a grim counterreality. This is a sexuality of rapacious egotism:</mark> "The divine beings saw how beautiful the daughters of men were and took wives from among those that pleased them" (6:2). Rashi draws on the midrash:[^26]</mark>

> _"The divine beings"_: These are princes who go about the business of God [<mark>_Elohim_ in the Torah has the root meaning of mastery, leadership</mark>].

> _"How beautiful"_: The word used is _tovot_— "goodly," written defectively [without a _vav_]. When a girl was being prepared and adorned to enter the _&#x1e25;upa_ [the marriage canopy], the ruler would enter and have intercourse with her first.

> _"From among those that pleased them"_: Even married women, even males, even animals. </mark>

The sexual temperament of the time is focused vividly in this image. The bride adorned on her wedding day, about to "enter" her new condition, to cross a threshold —"A threshold is a sacred thing," wrote Porphyrus in the third century[^27] —is snatched away to the bed of the "great one." <mark class="orange">This custom—known in later times as _ius primae noctis_, the right to the first night—exemplifies the institutionalization of barbarity.</mark>

<mark class="orange">If we are to speak of passion here, it is the arrogant passion of the self, for whom no Other exists, in her own subjectivity, her own readiness to open doors or leave them closed. The ruler simply enters the intimate domains of others and expresses his mastery. <mark>He ignores the sacredness of thresholds, the dangers, the hesitations, the temptations, the respect, due to doors.[^28]</mark> His act of entry is a way of saying, in the words of the midrash: "Either me or you. . . ."[^29] <mark>It is not an act of love, but an act of robbery.</mark> Richard Rorty discusses the passion of the torturer in similar terms. Referring to Elaine Scarry's book, _The Body in Pain_, he speaks of "the tearing down of the particular structures of language and belief in which [the victims] were socialized... The worst thing you can do to somebody is not to make her scream in agony but to use that agony in such a way that even when the agony is over, she cannot reconstitute herself... You can thereby, as Scarry puts it, 'unmake her world' by making it impossible for her to use language to describe what she has been."[^30]

<mark>The essential paradigmatic act of sexual sin is thus an act of rapacious self-assertion, which sweeps away all other "worlds," all other selves.</mark></mark> <mark class="orange">When Rashi says that the verdict against the Flood generation was sealed only because of the sin of robbery, we can understand him to be describing <mark>the _nature_ of the prevailing sexual fantasy</amrk> (and idolatrous fantasy) of the period. <mark>This is a fantasy in which self swells to fill all worlds, a colonial expansionism that radically denies the existence of other worlds of self and culture.</mark> "Either me or you. . . ." Essentially, <mark>this is a sexuality of cruelty, not of erotic relationship. It is a "pursuit of ecstasy which necessarily excludes attention to other people."[^31]</mark> At base, it is, to use Rorty's term, a "lack of curiosity."[^32]</mark>

The context in which these terms occur is a discussion of the work of Nabokov, and the theme of cruelty as related to the ecstasy-seeking of the artist. The central question, as Rorty sees it, is whether the obsessional nature of the artist does not entail a kind of fatal incuriosity, as to anything irrelevant to his own obsession. Nabokov claims that art is identified with the compresence of "curiosity, tenderness, kindness, and ecstasy." Curiosity, as Rorty notes, comes first.[^33] But Rorty treats Nabokov's manifesto as something of a pious hope, rather than a realized assurance. In reality, Nabokov "fears most . . . that <mark class="purple">one cannot have it both ways—that there is no synthesis of ecstasy and kindness."[^34]</mark>

### Ecstasy and kindness

These motifs provide us with a model that will be helpful in discussing the dilemma of the Flood generations. <mark class="orange"><mark>The main problem of the time — called sexual sin—is the very converse of love. Love is to be identified with curiosity, with that _attentiveness_ to the self-made worlds of others,</mark> which the midrash represents the Flood people as lacking. What we see in them is <mark>the excess of openness, manifested in the "desire to conquer all reticent beings."[^35] This is the _gezel_, the rapacious mode of sexuality.[^36] When this is the prevailing mode, then <mark>mass destruction, indiscriminate of selves and worlds, comes like a madness and washes away all selves, innocent and guilty alike.</mark></mark>

It is this issue of <mark>love-kindness-curiosity, as opposed to obsessive narcissism,</mark> that divides the Flood generation from the Tower of Babel generation. Rashi, quoting the midrash, asks why the Flood generation is punished so much more radically, why they are "washed away" (11:9). He answers by contrasting the "robbery" of the Flood generation with the "love and friendship" of the Tower of Babel generation. This, it seems, is the core of the matter.

It is on this score, of <mark>the cruelty that is basically incuriosity,</mark> that the Flood narrative evokes associations with the sin and fate of Sodom. There are verbal echoes in the two narratives,[^37] including the use of the word <mark class="blue">_&#x1e25;amas_, "violent robbery"</mark>. In a provocative passage, the prophet Ezekiel sketches <mark class="orange">the Sodom-like character of his own people: "Only this was the sin of your sister Sodom: arrogance! She and her daughters had plenty of bread and untroubled tranquillity; yet she did not support [lit., hold the hand of] the poor and the needy" (16:49). Nahum Sarna writes of the <mark>"callous disregard of the existence of poverty amidst an economy of plenty."[^38]</mark> Callous disregard is the existential meaning of the sexual openness of the Flood period, too.

In many midrashic sources, there is a recurrent comment on the long-term effects of the Flood on the cultural-sexual modalities of future generations. In the story of the rape of Dinah, for example, her brothers' anger is explained: "because Shekhem had committed an outrage in Israel, by lying with Jacob's daughter—a thing not to be done" (34:7). This phrase — "a thing not to be done" — is explained by Rashi: "to rape virgins, because the nations of the world had banned [lit., fenced themselves off from] sexual crimes, _as a result of the Flood_" Such crimes are simply "not done" after the Flood. They are taboos, even where an unmarried woman is concerned, suggests Mizrahi, in his commentary on Rashi, <mark class="orange">because of the factor of _gezel_ — of robbery, of violence against her autonomy, which is expressed in kidnapping and which is punishable by death.</mark>

Rambam, in his legal codex,[^39] even justifies the massacre of the whole city of Shekhem, on the basis of the fact that the prince had committed the crime of _gezel_— of robbery— and the whole city was silent accessory to the crime. This is a failure in justice, in the values of privacy and the rule of law, which became the foundation of the post-Flood era.[^40] And Shekhem's act of rape is thus seen as an exceptional rather than a typical act—"as a result of the Flood."

A similar point is made by Rashi on Jacob's tears when he meets Rachel for the first time: even a kiss, he fears, will be interpreted as an outrage against the decencies of the post-Flood ethos: "From the time that the world was punished by the Flood, all the nations resolved to ban [fence themselves off from] sexual immorality."[^41] In similar vein, when Avimelekh kidnaps Sarah, he expresses horror at the "great sin" of adultery (20:9), in which Abraham almost involved him, by claiming that Sarah was his sister (and not his wife).

<mark>The implication</mark> in these and other sources <mark>is that a kind of sexual puritanism was</mark>, at least for a certain period, <mark>the consequence of the Flood</mark>. Even the animals in the ark restrict themselves to their own kind. They leave the ark _le-mishpe&#x1e25;oteihem_ — "by families" (8:19): the midrashic comment is that the structures of family life, the taboos of civilization, are inculcated into the animal world, too, during the twelve-month period in the ark, so that when they emerge, it is with a changed nature, as it were —"They left in families —and _not themselves_.[^42]

In these two words ("not themselves" — _ve-lo heim_), the midrash, it seems, focuses <mark>the essential paradox that Freud describes in _Civilization and Its Discontents_—the costs and gains of repression of sexual energy</mark>. By focusing on the animal world, the midrash makes a radical statement about the transformations and sublimations possible in a new cultural-spiritual order. The power of the Flood, its destructive disregard of all privacies, gives rise to an era in which human beings set up voluntary fences and walls.

<mark class="orange"><mark>But the motive for the new puritanism is fear—a fear of the nihilism glimpsed in the unfocused expansionism</mark> of the Flood era. And the problem of the Flood generation is, therefore, not resolved; it merely undergoes metastasis, into different, even opposite forms. For <mark>the problem of "incuriosity," of "cruelty," in which only self exists, is diagnosed in the midrash as the arrogance of radical insecurity — "Either me or you". The obsessions of the self swell to fill the universe</mark>; the more they swell, the more remote they become from any stable ground of being. <mark>Human beings are driven to dominate external space, to act out their vertiginous freedoms. But vertigo then drives them inwards again, to construct prison houses of safety from the "mighty waters."</mark> These do not cure the vertigo; they merely exclude it.</mark>

The post-Flood generation, the builders of the Tower of Babel, have as their motto, "Me and not You." <mark class="purple">They set up safe houses of human solidarity, which are mere oases in the treacherous and indescribable world. It is, when all is said, a pathetic avoidance. What neither generation can encompass is a world with God at its center, so that one may dare to imagine a multiplicity of selves, of worlds, existing together, even interacting with one another in modes that build and do not destroy.</mark>

<mark class="orange"><mark>The radical problem, then, is that of imagining the world.</mark> All the pathologies of openness and closedness relate to imaginative obtuseness. According to the midrash in _Bereshit Rabbah_ (36:1), the Flood <mark class="purple">people see God as blind, indifferent, callous to the world. What follows is that human beings feel themselves free to be likewise blind, indifferent, and callous</mark></mark>:

> "When He is silent, who will condemn? If He hides His face, who will see Him, be it nation or man?" [Job 34:29]. R. Meir said, "This is what the generation of the Flood said: He is silent toward His world; He hides His face from His world, like a judge who has a curtain drawn over his face, so that he does not know what is happening outside. 'The clouds screen Him so He cannot see'" [Job 22:14].

<mark>God's silence, the curtain of cloud that screens man from His view—this is a philosophical understanding that justifies human cruelty. If God either ignores what is happening just beyond His line of sight</mark>, as it were, or if He is _shotef hakol_ — indiscriminately destroys whole generations — <mark>then human society is freed from the yoke of justice and responsibility. Or, at least, until the terrors of such freedom become so palpable that a backlash sets in.</mark>

To link God's justice in this way with human justice is not, of course, inevitable. George Eliot's manifesto to a godless world comes to mind: <mark class="orange">"She, stirred somewhat beyond her wont, and taking as her text the three words which have been used so often as the inspiring trumpet-calls of men—the words, _God, Immortality, Duty_ — pronounced, with terrible earnestness, how inconceivable was the first, how unbelievable the second, and yet how preemptory and absolute the _third_.[^43]</mark>

Though not inevitable, however, the Flood people's response has a desperate logic to it. Their cruelty is indeed the cruelty of despair. Where such a vision of the world prevails, even <mark class="purple">"the compassion of the wicked is cruelty" (Proverbs 12:10)</mark>. In another midrash, God and human beings are set in high relief against one another, precisely in relation to this question of cruelty and kindness:[^44]

> _"And God remembered Noah"_: It is written, "A righteous man knows the needs of his beast. But the compassion of the wicked is cruelty." The Righteous One of the world knows the needs, even of animals, even in His anger. He is unlike human kings, who send in their legions to quell a rebellion and kill both innocent and guilty alike—because they do not know rebel from loyal citizen. God, however, even in a generation that angers Him, saves the one righteous person in the generation: "He knows the needs of His beast." "But the compassion of the wicked is cruelty": these are the people of the Flood, who were cruel. The sages said: When God raised the depths over them, and they saw the fountains of the deep threaten to submerge them, what did they do? They had many children... and some of them would take their children and place them into the depths, pressing them down mercilessly. That is why it says, "The compassion of the wicked is cruelty." How do we know? Because Job said, "May the womb forget him; may he be sweet to the worms; may he be no longer remembered; may wrongdoers be broken like a tree" [Job 24:20] — his womb [sic!] no longer remembers that they were his children.

Rashi adds[^45] that the children were placed under their parents, in order to "block the openings of the deeps." The violent imagery of callousness, in which a child —one's own child — becomes a bung against one's own destruction, represents a failure of memory, of imagination. One's child is, after all, that being in the world of others in whom one's own face is reflected. God, by contrast, is exquisitely aware, "knows"; He can focus on the needs of the righteous man (strangely called "His beast") among the mass of the wicked. <mark>This is the opposite of cruelty— to know the individual and his needs. It is essentially curiosity, awareness of the otherness of the other.</mark> The animal imagery suggests the difference— the lower order—represented by man's reality and God's. Yet He focuses His attention and concern on "His beast."

The analogy is, of course, particularly appropriate in a context where Noah has earned the loving attention of God, precisely by his own loving attention to the animals. Here we can recall the midrash, quoted earlier, in which the traveler meets "one" on his journey, seeks his company to the point of giving him his daughter in marriage, and teaches him wisdom—which animal is to be fed at the second hour of the day, and which at the third hour of the night.[^46] We noticed that the King's daughter in midrashic symbolism is often a figure for Wisdom. God gives Noah, in token of His love, wisdom —the wisdom to know the feeding schedules of the animals! The anticlimax is palpable. But what looks like a bathetic ending to a midrash that is clearly designed on a principle of intensification in fact makes, possibly, the most important point of all about Noah and his relation to the world.

### Noah's Silence

At this point, and before we discuss Noah's role in the ark, we can return to the questions we raised earlier about Noah's involvement in the death sentence imposed on his world. Noah is indeed a man of his world and his time. He shares in the prevailing pathology; he is saved more for what he may be than for what he is.

If we are in any doubt about who Noah is, we have only to consider the central fact of his silence. From beginning to end of the Flood narrative, Noah says not a word. God talks to him twice before the Flood, telling of what is to come, telling him how to build the ark, to enter it with his family and representatives of the animal world. And after each of God's long speeches (6:13—21; 7:1 -4), the text tells us impassively, "And Noah did just as the Lord commanded him" (6:22; 7:5). Rashi distinguishes between the two acts of obedience: the first time, he obeyed by building the ark, the second time by entering it. But the impact of Noah's silent acquiescence in the destruction of the world is devastating.

His "unqualified apathy," as Andre Neher calls it,[^47] is not largely mitigated by the midrashic scenario, which has him building the ark over 120 years—a process that begins with planting the cedars that are to provide wood for the ark, so that they may become a topic of general conversation and lead to the rebuke and repentance of his contemporaries.[^48] Even in this midrash, Noah's imaginative solipsism is clear: he tells his interlocutors, "God intends to bring a Flood on the world, and told me to make an ark, so that I and my household may escape." It is not surprising that he is not effective in swaying his contemporaries. His silence is the reverse image of their babble.[^49]

Noah's silence, I suggest, is essentially a metastasis of the sickness of his time. He is incurious, he does not know and does not care what happens to others. He suffers from the incapacity to speak meaningfully to God or to his fellow human beings. He, too, is imprisoned by the "mighty waters," even though his prison takes the form of a small, enclosed, safe space.

<mark class="orange">Just here, however, is the paradoxical arena of Noah's transformation. Within the intimate but teeming space of the ark, Noah becomes, in the midrashic view, a new person—effectively, and retroactively, a person whom the Torah can describe as a tzaddik, a righteous man: "Said R. Levi, 'Even the mill stones were obliterated in the water—and yet you say,"And the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were" [9:18]? But Noah saw a new world.' ["Were" is understood as indicating new being.]... The Rabbis said, "Anyone of whom it is said, 'He _was_', is a feeder, a life sustainer".[^50]</mark>

The midrash treats Noah as one among five cases of people who are described as "seeing a new world," on the one hand, and "feeding and sustaining," on the other. To see a new world, in the case of Joseph, or Moses, or Job, or Mordecai, is to be understood metaphorically; these men underwent radical changes of fortune, so that their entire perspective on the world was transformed. In the case of Noah, of course, quite literally, the world itself was transformed around him. And yet even in his case, the midrash is to be read as a comment on Noah's subjective vision. Even the massive mill stones were turned to water. How could Noah _be_, in such a world of "mighty waters," if it were not that he was profoundly changed? When he comes out of the ark, he no longer belongs to the babble of the waters, nor to the silence of the withdrawal. And what has changed him is suggested in the second part of the midrash. "He _was_" means that he became a feeder and a life sustainer.

### Noah as life sustainer

The core of the ark experience is Noah's relation to the animals he brings with him, "to keep alive with you" (6:19). When God speaks to Noah the first time, He tells him to do three things: to build the ark, to enter it with his family, and to bring into it representatives of the animal world. The culmination of God's speech is the last verse (6:21): "For your part [_ve-ata_], take of everything that is eaten and store it away, to serve as food for you and for them." "For your part" — _ve-ata_ — parallels the "For My part" — _ve-ani_ — of 6:17. God's role is to bring the Flood: Noah's role is complementary, even **contrapuntal**. He is to prepare food, for human beings and for animals. "Noah did so; just as God commanded him, so he did" (6:22). He takes food for all, but kah lekha—literally, "Take for yourself" — though an idiom, introduces the suggestion that feeding the animals will be in some sense conducive to his own welfare.

_Bereshit Rabbah_ engages in a serious discussion of the type of food Noah brings into the ark.[^51] One view is that he brought pressed figs, an acceptable neutral diet for men and animals. ("Food for you and for them" indicates a single diet for both.) But another view is that he brought a different, individual diet for each species. ("For you and for them" indicates specific, individual foods for each species, with the human diet primary.) Ultimately, the midrash concludes, "You shall store it away _for yourself_" (literal translation) indicates that "No one brings something in [lit.], unless he has need of it."

All the feeding that Noah does in the ark, all the varieties of food that he stores there, all have to do with the question of _need_ — in the obvious sense, the animals' need, but ultimately, _his_ need. <mark>To "bring something in" is to satisfy need — the basic model is the human body, with its apertures, through which vital requirements are absorbed.</mark> And yet, paradoxically, in this and in many other versions of the midrashic narrative, all attention is focused on the variations and details of the _animals'_ needs.

In Tan&#x1e25;uma 2, for instance, the animals are fed not only the kinds of food they are used to, but at the times they are used to. Here, we recall the midrash about the traveler who teaches his new-found friend the acme of wisdom ("marries him to his daughter") — the timing of animal meals. Here, too, the prooftext is, "A wise man captivates people" (lit., takes souls) (Proverbs 11:30). This refers, claims the midrash, to Noah, who fed and sustained the cattle. Noah's wisdom is demonstrated in his painstaking, detailed knowledge of the feeding schedules of every species within the ark. "For twelve months in the ark, he had not a wink of sleep, neither by day nor by night, for he was occupied in feeding the creatures who were with him —'The wise man takes souls??/ ".

It is clear that Noah plays a God-like role in "feeding the creatures." Like God, he is the type of the "righteous man, who knows the needs of his beast" (Proverbs 12:10). We have discussed the kind of concern, of curiosity, that according to Tanhuma 7 God demonstrates, by contrast to <mark class="orange">the cruelty of the Flood people. <mark>The knowledge of the tzaddik is focused on the needs (lit., the soul) of the animal.</mark> In another midrash (Tan&#x1e25;uma 5), Noah as tzaddik is defined specifically by his "feeding the creatures of God." <mark>To be a righteous man is to care for and provide the needs of all creatures</mark> — like God Himself. But the basis of such concern is spelled out in our midrash: <makr>to be able to feed, one must have not simply sterling character, but a kind of curiosity, a kind of wisdom.</mark>

The animals are the prototype objects of this kind of nurturing knowledge. <mark>Without verbal communication, the righteous man is still expected to intuit the dumb world of the Other.He is defined by his capacity to nurture the needy, with the right food, at the right moment. The knowing of need is the highest measure of that curious, tender concern that characterizes God and God-like man.</mark></mark>

In a startling comment on "the needs of his beast," Rashi explains, "What his cattle and his family need." He is not inhibited about equating cattle and human beings under the basic rubric of need. "Your justice is like the great deep; man and beast You deliver, O Lord" (Psalms 36:7). Here, again, <mark class="purple">Rashi emphasizes that there is no shame in the animal needs of the whole human being; indeed, there is an existential realism and humility, in the recognition of these needs.</mark>

<mark class="purple">For the relation of a human being to his needs can be a matter of joy and affirmation of life.</mark> Emmanuel Levinas writes:

> <mark class="orange">Nourishment as a means of invigoration, is the transmutation of the other into the same, which is in the essence of enjoyment: an energy that is other, recognized as other... becomes, in enjoyment, my own energy, my strength, me. All enjoyment is in this sense alimentation... The bare fact of life is never bare. Life is not the naked will to be, an ontological _Sorge_ for this life. <mark>Life's relation with the very conditions of its life becomes the nourishment and content of that life.</mark> <mark>Life is love of life, a relation with contents that are not my being but more dear than my being</mark>: thinking, eating, sleeping, reading, working, warming oneself in the sun. Distinct from my substance but constituting it, these contents make up the worth [prix] of my life... <mark>The human being thrives on his needs</mark>; he is happy for his needs... Happiness is made up not of an absence of needs, whose tyranny and imposed character one denounces, but of the satisfaction of all needs... Happiness is accomplishment: it exists in a soul satisfied and not in a soul that has extirpated its needs, a castrated soul.[^52]</mark></mark>

<mark class="orange">Ultimately, the relation of Noah to the animals' needs is symbolic of the relation of the self to its own needs, to its most real and intimate interactions with the other. To be hungry and eat is to experience enjoyment and power—the independence of "a subject capable of ensuring the satisfaction of its needs."[^53] <mark class="purple">The very concrete animal quality of the need for food generates the sense of personal potency.</mark></mark>

The traditional midrashic view is that sexuality receives no expression in the ark. Instead, there is feeding, the acute awareness of timing and taste in nurturing the other. I suggest that feeding animals becomes a year-long workshop in the kindness that Rorty defined as "curiosity." <mark>The sexual area is too dangerous, for the time being: too much abuse, too much cruelty has become part of its essential fantasy.</mark> Feeding animals, too, however, can be dangerous. The midrash, quoted by Rashi (7:23), depicts Noah as injured by a lion when he is late with its meal. <mark>Dealing with the Other is never safe</mark>, apparently. His "alterity" (Levinas's term) is essential and irreducible; yet, as Levinas puts it, "it is visible only from an I." All the feeding, the storing of foods, the exquisite concern and attentiveness, are ultimately functions of Noah's relation with his own needs.[^54] The "I" of Noah is being trained to an alertness that makes sleep impossible ("He never tasted the taste of sleep!"[^55]). <mark>He gives food to the animals and gains enjoyment for himself. His work is altruistic and nurtures his own sense of potency.</mark>

### Kindness and ecstasy

<mark class="orange">Over twelve months, <mark>the ark becomes a crucible in which a new type of sensibility is nurtured</mark>. It is a closed interior, cut off from the raging waters outside. Entering this interior is not simple. Many midrashic sources stress the difficulty of God's command, "You shall enter the ark" (6:18): the smallness of the ark for so many inhabitants,[^56] Noah's delay until the water is lapping around his ankles,[^57] the attacks by enraged contemporaries, of giant size and force.[^58] <mark>"You shall enter the ark" can be read as a promise, rather than a command[^59]</mark></mark> — an assurance that Noah will find the strength needed for this entry. And Rashi reads the second statement of Noah's obedience—"Noah did just as God commanded him" (7:5)—as referring simply to the act of entry, in all its apparent banality.

It seems that <mark>Noah senses great danger in this entry, <mark>a cutting-off from all previous experience</mark>{<span class="note">It is easy to break a low. It is not so easy to put it back together again</span>}. Gaston Bachelard writes evocatively of the power of doors:

> Is there one of us who hasn't in his memories a Bluebeard chamber that should not have been opened, even half-way? Or — which is the same thing for a philosophy that believes in the primacy of the imagination — that should not even have been imagined open, or capable of opening half-way?... [The poet] knows that there are two "beings" in a door, that a door awakens in us a two-way dream, that it is doubly symbolical.[^60]

<mark class="orange">Indeed, the narrative emphasizes, after the several variations of the clause, "Noah came into the ark," "And God shut him in" (7:16). An ambiguous slam of the door, protecting, imprisoning. Claustrophobia sets in, as we read of all the animal flesh, male and female, enclosed with Noah for twelve months. <mark>All this flesh is to be seen by him</mark>, in one sense, <mark>as his own flesh</mark>, its needs are to be his needs: "to keep alive with you" (6:19). <mark>The ark is to be a laboratory of kindness, of attentiveness to the needs and the enjoyment that are</mark>, in Levinas's terms, <mark>the "contents of life."</mark> But how does Noah deal with the claustrophobia, the sense of being cut off from that other world that Rorty defines as one in which "ecstasy" is pursued? <mark class="purple">Are the two modalities incompatible—kindness, curiosity, attentiveness to others as other, on the one hand, and ecstasy, obsession, at worst, cruelty, on the other?</mark></mark>

Midrash Tan&#x1e25;uma, as we have seen, imagines Noah's constant prayer to have been "Release my soul from enclosure" (Psalms 142:8). This, in fact, becomes a leitmotif in the Tanhuma narrative: the paradox of Noah's desire to be free of the ark, on the one hand, and his reluctance to leave, on the other. God has closed him in. When He tells Noah, finally, "Come out of the ark" (8:16), He means a most intimate form of release — a release from the sexual abstinence, the nonecstatic modality of the ark.[^61] Noah has prayed for this release, yet he refuses it, on the grounds of his apprehension that further floods may sweep away all his efforts to live at the margins of ecstasy. There is an unresolved dilemma in Noah's consciousness: between openness and closedness, <mark>between the mighty waters of ecstasy and the alert attentiveness of kindness.</mark>

When he prays, "Release my soul from enclosure," he expresses his claustrophobia at being entirely committed to the feeding of others. The _Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer_ version of the narrative[^62] paraphrases the meaning of his prayer: "for my soul is weary of the smell of the lions and the bears." A profound angst cries from these words. It is not simply a physical weariness that afflicts him, the unremitting rigor of a feeding schedule that never allows him a "taste of sleep." The smell of the animals, in the final analysis, unnerves him. The sense of smell evokes intimations, essences of an experience. To be totally present to the needs of the animals—this is the very meaning of the ark experience. Within the density and compression of the ark, multiple relationships and forms of knowledge open up. And yet, through that very saturation in the feeding mode, Noah becomes achingly aware of a "weariness," a fatigue that dreams of another way of being. <mark class="purple">"O God!" says Hamlet, "I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams."[^63]</mark>

### The two-way dream

Noah's dream is a dream of the door, the window, the opening. God closes him in; nothing is left of the world but what is inside the Ark: "Only Noah and those with him in the ark" survive (7:23). But, adds _Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer_, with magnificent disregard for the apparent clarities of the text, Og, the king of Bashan, also survived. He "sat on a plank of the ladders of the ark, and swore to Noah and his sons that he would be a slave to them for ever. What did Noah do? He pierced a hole in the ark, and handed him his food every day, so that he too survived."[^64] Through the giant Og, the race of giants survives the Flood, the race of lordly, rapacious heroes, who recognized no bar to their pursuit of ecstasy.[^65] Og, too, must survive, if Noah is to survive in that "half-open" form that Gaston Bachelard describes so evocatively:

> For the door is an entire cosmos of the Half-open. In fact, it is one of its primal images, the very origin of a daydream that accumulates desires and temptations: the temptation to open up the ultimate depths of being, and the desire to conquer all reticent beings. The door schematizes two strong possibilities, which sharply classify two types of daydream. At times, it is closed, bolted, padlocked. At others, it is open, that is to say, wide open.

> But then come the hours of greater imagining sensibility. On May nights, when so many doors are closed, there is one that is just barely ajar. We have only to give it a very slight push! The hinges have been well oiled. And our fate becomes visible.[^66]

"There are two 'beings' in a door, [it] awakens in us a two-way dream." Noah must enter the ark, cut himself off from the world and discover the closed daydream, with its "temptation to open up the ultimate depths of being." But, "in hours of greater imaginary sensibility," he must pierce a hole in the ark, must feed the giant, who now swears eternal subjugation to the domain of kindness. The opening in the ark acts as a kind of valve, regulating the flow of nourishment from Noah to the giant. Implicitly, however, the flow is not all one way; Noah perforates the shell of his safety to maintain relations with the giant who is outside and inside.

> The most significant use of the opening in the ark's surface occurs when, after forty days, Noah "opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent out the raven" (8:6-7). The "window," Rashi identifies with the _tzohar_, the "opening for daylight," which Noah had built into the ark from the first (6:16). This is distinct from "the opening of the ark, which is made for coming in and going out." After the raven fails to return, Noah sends out the dove, "to see whether the waters had decreased from the surface of the ground" (8:8). The verb, "sent out," is explained by Rashi: "This is not the word for 'sending a messenger' but for 'sending off on its way.' The bird is set free, and thus Noah will see if the waters have decreased — for if she finds a resting place, she will not return."

<mark class="orange">Rashi makes a subtle point here. The dove is not being sent to fulfill a mission, to "see" the world and report. Noah simply releases her to act as is natural to her. It is Noah who will "see" from her behavior what is the reality outside the ark. In other words, the dove represents a kind of communications system: Noah is mobilizing a symbolic language, by which he may make statements about the world. For this, he needs an "opening" in the ark, an expression of his need to read what he cannot empirically see. When the dove finally returns with the torn olive leaf in her mouth, Noah "knew" that the waters had abated. This is a knowledge with no practical effect. Noah makes no move to leave the ark, until he is told to do so. But he must "see," he must "know."</mark>

What the opening in the ark suggests, in fact, is the growth of a new, human, sensibility: Noah "sees a new world." In the narrative of the dove, we find, for the first time, a self-awareness, a consciousness of expectation and disappointment, as Noah trains his eyes on the hole that perforates his box (the literal meaning of _teiva_ — usually translated "ark.") The word, _va-yahel_ — "he waited another seven days" — is repeated (8:10, 12): for the first time, we are given a sense of human loneliness, as time is endured, as Noah waits for something new to begin. The word contains nuances of "anticipation." But, as Samson Raphael Hirsch suggests (8:12), the second _va-yahel_ (because of its passive _niphal_ form) actually conveys a contrary mood: he was _disappointed_ in his expectations.

The flickering of hope and disillusion through time is conveyed here for the first time in the Torah. Noah, cut off, plumbing the depths of his being, measures time—again, as no one has before —by the years of his life. The Flood is his private history: "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day, all the fountains of the great deep burst apart" (7:11). "In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the waters began to dry from the earth" (8:13). The objective date is controversial: is the first month _Tishrei_ or _Nisan_?[^67] The perspective is subjective: Noah suffers the Flood, it is he who needs both to experience the inwardness of the ark and to devise ways of seeing what is unseen beyond its opening.

### Adam and Noah: building and contemplating

Noah's "half-open" condition is a new variation on a theme whose classical form is articulated in an earlier narrative. Eve was created from one of Adam's ribs. There, too, there was a cutting and a closing. It was God who put Adam to sleep. With man unconscious, God removed a part of him, closed the flesh over the incision, and "built" the rib into a woman (2:21-22). Man was separated from himself so that he hardly knew of his loss, until he met it face to face. It was God who did the cutting, the closing, and the building.

<mark class="orange">The building — _va-yiven_ — is the subject of important punning in the midrash: "This teaches that God gave superior _bina_ — understanding — to woman over man."[^68] <mark>The root, "to build/understand," evokes a kind of knowledge in which one constructs from what is merely implicit in a given situation.</mark> For example, in another midrash, God "contemplates from what organ to create Eve — not from the head, so that she should not be haughty, not from the eye, so that she should not be inquisitive etc."[^69] God intuits the implications for the future of the choices of the present. Something not yet present is to be evolved; for this, _bina_ — understanding — is required. (In the terms of this midrash, <mark>the characteristic desired by God is modesty</mark>.)</mark>

All this happens while Adam is unconscious. When he meets woman for the first time, he knows she is bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, but has no idea of the processes, the choices, the incisions and closures that have gone into her making. With Noah, the theme is replayed with significant variations. Now, it is Noah who has to "enter" the ark and cut himself off from the world—in fact, from a part of himself. It is God who closes him in, seals him from infection and an overpowering sense of loss. But Noah does not sleep—not a wink, insists the midrash — he is consciousduring the entire twelve-month operation. And, as we have seen, he is not really sealed. He is ajar, half-open, committed to the ark, and to all "who are with him,, —the repeated phrase describes his attentiveness and alert kindness —but also discovering in his vision of his lost world a wonder in alienation that was not his, when he lived a citizen in that world.

For now, the building/contemplating response is his, not God's. The result of the whole ark experience, imprisonment and release, is crystallized in that one word, _va-yiven_ — "And Noah built an altar to the Lord" (8:20). <mark>He meets his world as he emerges from the ark, like Adam meeting Eve with the gratitude and wonder, with the "wild surmise"[^70] of encountering a part of himself grown immeasurably more valuable in its new otherness.</mark>

But Noah, unlike Adam, is conscious; it is he who "constructs" the experience. "He contemplated — 'Why did God command me to bring more pure than impure animals into the ark? —if not to offer sacrifices from them?' "[^71] "He searched his heart, and said, 'God has saved me from the waters of the Flood and brought me out of that enclosure — am I not obliged to offer Him sacrifices and burnt offerings?'"[^72] In both versions of the midrash, Noah explores the implications of the known, to arrive at what has not, in fact, been told him. He discovers the capacity to read the text of God's words, in the first version. Or—in the second version — he learns to read the text of his own most intimate experience: he "searches his heart" for what he must do, for what is entailed in the story of his double salvation. Neither of those "strong possibilities" that Bachelard schematizes through the imagery of the door—padlocked, or wide open—is the home of his soul, in "hours of greater imaginary sensibility." God has saved him both from the "waters of the Flood" and from "that enclosure." And Noah "builds" his response to the implications of that double escape.

### Noah enlarged

There is a peculiar aptness to Noah's response. One who is saved from prison, one who has been "brought out" into the air and the light, celebrates his redemption by an act of consciousness: "I am the man who has known affliction" (Lamentations 3:1). Unlike Adam, who slept through both opening and closing, Noah builds his world by understanding it. The dynamic is perhaps most clearly presented in the Psalmist's cry: <mark class="orange">"O peoples, bless our God, celebrate His praises; who has granted us life, and has not let our feet slip... You have caught us in a net, caught us in trammels... We have endured fire and water, and You have brought us through to prosperity. I enter Your house with burnt offerings, I pay my vows to You, vows that my lips pronounced, that my mouth uttered in my distress"</mark> (Psalms 66:8-14). The Psalmist directly relates his entrapment, enclosure, and release, his coming in and coming out — the Hebrew text is subtly transfused with the root words for entry and exit[^73] — with the act of sacrifice — burnt offerings, the voluntary "coming in" to the House of God.

But why are burnt offerings, specifically, the instinctive response of both Noah and the Psalmist? Would a thanks-offering (shelamim) not have been more plausible? One answer is suggested by Radal, quoting the Zohar.[^74] Noah offers burnt offerings (which are considered as atonement for wayward motions of the heart) because of his apprehension during his time in the ark, that he would be left in the lurch, that he had, in a sense, exhausted all his credit with God in being saved from the Flood. <mark>Noah now acknowledges the complex love of God that transcends the simplistic expectations of human beings.</mark> Caught between openness and closedness, Noah suffered despair: perhaps God can save only in the mode of closure, of kindness? Perhaps Noah is not sufficiently versatile to be saved from his own salvation? In the wonder of release, Noah's gratitude is irradiated with a desire to atone for the meagerness of his faith.

The Psalmist speaks of past speech: "that my lips pronounced, that my mouth uttered in my distress." <mark>"In my distress" (lit., in my narrowness) suggests the pressure of a condition in which one can imagine no enlargement</mark>. What Noah experiences, when he is released, is the subtle gratitude of one who now realizes the implications of where he was and where he is. The burnt offering articulates the evolution of consciousness that is now part of the human repertoire.

The history of Noah is, then, the history of man's first exercise in self-construction. Between the worlds of kindness and ecstasy, between closedness and openness, Noah reads and interprets the texts of God's words and of his own heart. "These are the generations of Noah: Noah..." Noah is his own primary creation. Midrashic commentary on Noah's narrative is filled with references to the problems and privileges of interpretation, translation, word play, to the whole area of the Oral Law, of what the mouth may say, as it engages in the complex act called "reading." <mark>"The unexamined life is not worth living," said Socrates. With Noah and his children, self-criticism, searchings of the heart and of the words of God, become a measure of the life that is worth living.</mark>

### Human infancy and "transitional space"

The end of Noah's story is his first speech (9:25-27). Noah's only words come close after he has drunk the wine that celebrates his return to the world of ecstasy. He sleeps — for the first time in twelve months? — and unspeakable things are done to him by Ham, his son. He wakes, he knows, and he curses and blesses his children. Instead of the wicked being destroyed by God, they are from this point on _described_ by man. Noah, dumb till now, takes over God's role of blessing and cursing. He declares his commitment to a certain model of reality, in which he recognizes the variables of "less" and "more." (Conceptually, "blessing" is the modality of "more," while "cursing" is the modality of "less.") In other words, he composes a world: it is "as though he made himself."[^75]

<mark class="orange">After the Flood, God looks with new, almost inexplicable tolerance on the very problem of intrinsic evil that had precipitated destruction just a year before: "The Lord smelled the pleasing odour [of the sacrifices], and <mark>the Lord said to Himself: <mark>Never again will I doom the earth because of man, since _the devisings of man's mind are evil from his youth_" (8:21)</mark>.[^76]</mark>{<span class="note">Note: Compare v6:5</span>}</mark>

Rabbenu Bahya offers a compelling reading of this diagnosis of the human condition:[^77]

> <mark class="orange">The Sages have said, "'From his youth' means, <mark>'from the time that he shakes himself free</mark> [_nin'ar_ puns on _ne'urav_, "youth"] <mark>from his mother's womb.'"[^78] Evil enters him from that moment on.</mark> It is known that a man is not obligated to keep the commandments (which are addressed to the good inclination) until the age of thirteen. That is why the Sages said, "The evil inclination is older than the good intention by thirteen years!"[^79] And that is why Solomon said, <mark>"Better a poor but wise youth ... for [he] can emerge from a dungeon to become king" [Ecclesiastes 4:13-14]. From the time he leaves the womb, where he was incarcerated like a man in prison—immediately, he wants to rule. He seeks out the nipple and is drawn after his desires.</mark></mark>

<mark class="orange">In Bahya's reading, man is seen as an evolving being. God looks at the post-Flood generation as a new and more hopeful infancy. It is true that <mark>"evil" — that is, the energy of powerful and uncompromising desires</mark> — is at its strongest at this stage. But the prospect of maturity is the reward of an evolutionary view of man. Human history is still in its infancy; <mark>the arrogance of the libido is expressed in an oral mode</mark> (even the nipple is called the "mouth of the breast"!), <mark>as the new-born seeks to attach everything to itself, to "become king."</mark> George Eliot uses the same metaphor to describe the process by which <mark class="purple">human beings grow out of moral "stupidity" to the realization that the world is not "an udder to feed our supreme selves."[^80]</mark></mark>

In a sense, Noah is reborn Adam. He emerges from the womb-prison and, in one midrashic view, he proceeds to make exactly the same mistakes that the first Adam made. "Noah, the tiller of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard" (9:20). The Babylonian Talmud, in Sanhedrin 70a, has God reproach Noah: " 'Noah, should you not have learned from the first Adam, whose fate befell him only because of wine?' So we learn that the tree Adam ate of was the vine." Another midrash notes that from being called a "righteous man," he is now called an _am ha-aretz_, an ignoramus (lit., an earthy man—see 9:20): "God said to him, 'What are you doing in a vineyard? Was not Adam punished with mortality, just because of wine?' "[^81]

The difference between Adam and Noah is precisely this —that Noah has Adam's narrative as his text to decipher. He has undertaken the task of construction, the work of <mark>the Oral Law, which speaks what is not written</mark>. It is the task of reading. If he sins, because of his "lateness," his sin has something of the character of a "misreading." "He was the first — _va-yi&#x1e25;al_ — to plant a vineyard." In many midrashic renderings, the expression is understood as something like, "He construed profanely," or, in Rashi's version, "He made himself profane."

Noah comes as the second Adam; he sees a new world, but he remembers the old world, he has a sense of the choices that have gone to the making of his evolving identity. God's new-found tolerance may be a function of just this new self-awareness of man. <mark class="purple">For <mark>if it is emotional stupidity to treat the world as an udder, it is at the same time an essential phase of human growth</mark>. D. W. Winnicott writes of the illusion of the infant that he creates and controls the breast. This illusory omnipotence of the small being who has just emerged from a dungeon and imagines himself king is a sine qua non of healthy growth. Only if the infant has been given sufficient opportunity for illusion can he be successfully disillusioned. Physically, the child is weaned; emotionally, he comes to recognize objective reality and his own unkingly place in it. Yet in the space between breast and the world, which Winnicott calls "transitional space," the child learns to play, to construct the "transitional phenomena" that link him with both mother and world. This is the area of culture that partakes of imagination and reality, tenderness and ecstasy.[^82] And this area is Noah's invention, as he chooses meanings, identities, versions of a world that is new and old at the same time.</mark>
