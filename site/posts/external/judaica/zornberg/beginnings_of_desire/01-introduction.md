## Acknowledgments

The genesis of this book was in the loving teaching of my parents, Rabbi Dr. and Mrs. Wolf Gottlieb, whose Torah of life animates me to this day. Many teachers have opened up for me the depths of Torah, among them, Rabbi Shmuel Sperber z7, Rabbi Chaim Brovender, and Rabbi Daniel Epstein, whose scholarship and imagination inspired me to explore my own resources in learning Torah. Friends and students have been a source of insight and of warm support. I especially thank David Shulman, who responded to the manuscript with extraordinary understanding, grace, and enthusiasm. Susan Handelman, Baruch Hochman, Micha Odenheimer, Susan Shapiro, Debbie Weissman, and Linda Zisquit read some chapters and made illuminating comments. Other people helped in other ways, among them Julie Greenblatt, Diane Levenberg, Paul Mandel, Tessa Manoim, and Eva Weiss. I am grateful to Tamar Ross for many stimulating conversations, not directly on Genesis, and for encouraging me to begin a career in Torah teaching; to my late uncle, Rabbi Moshe Rosen z"l, for his constant interest and wisdom; to Freema Gottlieb, my sister and friend; to Judy Goldstein, for her cheerful readiness to help in computer crises; to Fern Seckbach for indexing; to the staff of JPS, especially Diane W. Zuckerman. Ellen Frankel has been an ideal editor, scholarly and sympathetic and unfailingly enthusiastic.

"I have learned from all my teachers, and from my students most of all" (Ethics of the Fathers). I am deeply grateful to the many students who have responded with passion and insight, in class and after class, to my teaching. I wish to thank the Littauer Foundation for its financial support. My book is dedicated to my husband, Eric, whose love and encouragement created space for thinking and writing. It is also dedicated to our children, Bracha, Moshe, and Avraham; their life and growth have brought us much joy.

## Introduction

These essays on the weekly Parsha emerged from ten years of teaching the biblical readings to classes here in Jerusalem. I was fortunate to have eager and intelligent audiences, whose spoken&mdash;and even unspoken&mdash;responses made it possible for me to discover, year after year, what further might be said on the matter-of-the-week.

These audiences were composed of a wide range of people, of all ages, professional and intellectual backgrounds, and levels of Jewish learning. The gamut ran from young American women and men studying in Israeli _yeshivot_ (colleges of advanced learning) for a year or more before proceeding to college study in the United States, to professionals, housewives, artists, poets, and professors; from those who had had little previous contact with biblical and midrashic literature to those who had spent many years delving into the layers of meaning within these texts. The meeting places were some of the many colleges for adult Jewish education that have burgeoned in Jerusalem over the last twenty years.

What I did over the years was to share my own personal struggles for meaning, to discover the ways in which life and text inform each other. My audiences were in the position of "eavesdropping" on my meditations, on the literary and philosophical resonances emerging from these texts. These personal meditations were a weaving of biblical, midrashic, and literary sources; my students would receive a list of the sources and use them as a basis for further study. My mode of inquiry was closer to the "rhetorical" than to the "methodical," in terms of Gerald Bruns's distinction—the "rhetorical" having "no greater ambition than to discover what can be said, in any given case." The rhetorical mode, which Bruns sees as characteristic of most literary criticism, is "more concerned with finding than with proving, is more speculative than analytical, more heuristic than polemical." It explores problems, relationships, patterns, without arriving at single-minded or schematic theories. The rhetorician is a "public meditator."[^1]

My teaching mode, exploratory, ironic, open to turbulence, suspicious of fixities, had to be translated into an equivalent written text. There is no one specific audience I have in mind for these essays. I expect that readers from different backgrounds, "eavesdropping" on these meditations, in their written form, will find different parts of the book either strange or familiar. In introducing it, I am, however, reluctant to engage in post facto methodological framings of my approach to biblical and midrashic sources. For essentially my way of reading these sources is highly untheoretical: the work of interpretation is done "in the field," in close attention to themes and motifs I sense within the words on the page. It is a kind of listening for the meta-messages of the text. My assumption is that the narrative block that constitutes a Parsha has thematic integrity, that the midrash is concerned to draw out the implicit dynamics of the biblical narrative, and to limn the internal tensions that continue, to our own day, to trouble and animate human beings. The field of energy that is thus set up I have tried to register in these essays. I make use of an extensive range of sources to release the expressive internal logic of each Parsha. Some of these sources are exegetical, others are drawn from my reading in such areas as literature, literary criticism, psychology, philosophy, and anthropology. The exegetical sources range from the Talmud and Midrash to medieval and modern commentaries on the Bible, to hasidic meditations and homilies. The other sources constitute my mental "in-scape," the landscape of my mind, and, as such, must inform my responses to the implicit dynamics of the biblical text. Here, I would like to spell out certain assumptions that may help the reader in engaging with a perhaps unfamiliar approach to the biblical narrative. One of my assumptions is that the sources I refer to set up a field of tension and mutual illumination with the biblical text. I am not looking simply to elucidate either what the Bible "really means" or what moral or homiletical uses can be made of the biblical narrative. I am looking to loosen the fixities, the ossifications of preconceived readings. To do this, a dialectical hermeneutics is essential: an opening of the ear, eye, and heart to a text that reflects back the dilemmas and paradoxes of the world of the reader.

Two examples may clarify my point. When Rashi comments on the birth of Joseph's sons in Egypt, "before the years of famine came" (Genesis 41:50), he observes that we learn from that nuance of timing that it is forbidden to have sexual relations in time of famine. This comment, drawn from the Babylonian Talmud (_Ta'anit 11a_), is a legal principle gleaned from a close reading of the narrative. Normally, readers will assume that we are learning about life, about how to behave in time of famine, from the biblical text. Life is strange territory; it requires the compass, the orientation of biblical guidance. The Bible is familiar, life is strange. We bring the two together, to shed light on life. What is produced in the end becomes a commonplace of proper behaviour, derived from, or&mdash;in a more sophisticated approach&mdash;drawing authority from the Bible.

My assumption is that a much more complex, dialectical dynamic is possible. If Rashi introduces into his commentary an observation about sexuality and famine, this can be read back into the original text. We are now encouraged to reflect on Joseph's larger situation, in terms of the dynamics of fertility, sexuality, famine, and corruption: Joseph's sense of
normalcy in a strange land is reflected in his oblivious fertility. We use Rashi's legal observation as a way to probe beneath the surface of Joseph's inner conflicts. An apparently homiletical or legal comment is also an exegetical one.

Another example would be Rashi's comment on the beautiful ending to Isaac's "courtship" of Rebecca. Isaac meets his bride, after an extremely long account of the matchmaking adventures of his father's servant. "Isaac then brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he took Rebecca as his wife. Isaac loved her, and thus found comfort after his mother's death" (Genesis 24:67). Rashi comments: "It is the way of the world (_derekh eretz_) that as long as a man's mother is alive, he is attached to her [lit., bound up, involved]; when she dies, he comforts himself in his wife."

Here, again, a realistic observation about life is gleaned from the text; one might even describe Rashi's comment as Freudian, opening his readers' eyes to the dynamics of intimate family relationships. But, again, I would suggest that Rashi's apparent generalization provides us with a key to the narrative itself. Rashi seems to be describing a tension between two loves&mdash;for mother and for wife&mdash;experienced at the same time; only after the mother dies does the man turn "for comfort" to his wife&mdash;implicitly, the marriage relation then assumes fuller proportions. In Isaac's story, of course, there is a gap, probably of several years, between his mother's death and his marriage to Rebecca. Indeed, the discrepancy between the situation in the Bible narrative and that described by Rashi should deter the reader from making too-facile extrapolations from the text to life. Precisely because the two cases are not symmetrical, Rashi's observation leads us to reflect again upon Isaac's relation with his mother, his involvement (_karukh etzla_) with her life and her death, and the nature of the comfort he later finds in Rebecca. This more complex vision of Isaac's situation would then reinform the reader's sense of what Rashi calls &mdash;the way of the world&mdash;which means, basically, the uncommon commonness of things, the ways human beings struggle with the nature of the world.

It seems to me that Rashi usually writes in such a multivalent way, transforming the reader's comprehension of the biblical text, even in his most&ndash;apparently&ndash;fantastic citations from the midrash. His commentary works as a dreamtext, suggesting many alternative &ndash;but not exclusive&ndash;facets of reality. In both the cases I have discussed, the feedback loop radiates a field of energy that includes both the reader, with his/her life situation, and the text. For to understand Isaac, Sarah, and Rebecca through a Freudian reading of Rashi is, of course, to re-understand ourselves.

This field, or circle of understanding, yields endless illumination. If at first the text seems familiar, while life is strange, needy of privileged guidance, at a later stage of reading the situation may be reversed: life acquires a new familiarity, a new intelligibility, in the light of Rashi's deployment of midrashic sources, while the original text suddenly seems alien, uncanny, needy of reinterpretation.

This dialectic of strangeness and familiarity is the gift of art; in this sense, I would regard Rashi and his midrashic precursors as poets. George Steiner alerts us to this paradoxical effect of art: on the one hand, "all representations, even the most abstract, infer a rendezvous with intelligibility or, at the least, with a strangeness attenuated"; on the other, "much of poetry, music and the arts aims to . . . make strangeness in certain respects stranger."[^2] It is the tension between these two statements that underlies my readings of Genesis.

This cycle of desire is present in all dimensions of life, intellectual, interpretive, as well as overtly emotional. The reader needs most of all the animation of desire, which is generated, paradoxically, by the experience of "not to have:

<div class="poem">
the priest desires. The philosopher desires<br />
And not to have is the beginning of desire.<br />
To have what is not is its ancient cycle.<br />
It is desire at the end of winter, when<br />
It observes the effortless weather turning blue<br />
It knows that what it has is what is not<br />
And throws it away like a thing of another time<br />
As morning throws off stale moonlight and shabby sleep.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Wallace Stevens, "Notes toward a Supreme Fiction"
</div>

"What it has is what is not": the economics of desire apply to priests and philosophers and readers of ancient and modern texts. The aim of interpretation is, I suggest, not merely to domesticate, to familiarize an ancient book: it is also, and perhaps more importantly, to "make strangeness in certain respects stranger," to make the reader aware, in the current that runs between his/her lived situation and the text, of the ways in which we are "at key instants, strangers to ourselves, errant at the gates of our own psyche."[^3]

My approach, therefore, has been concerned to detect the intimations of disorder within order, instability within stability, the tensions evoked by questions about human life and the search for God that the midrash expresses to such ambiguous effect. On the one hand, we are reassured to find ourselves, with our most radical dilemmas, reflected in these ancient texts. On the other hand, the midrashic strategy will not allow us to rest in a formalized, serenely fixed image of human life, with merely homiletical messages to brace us in desirable postures. In its variety and restlessness of versions of the narrative, the midrash invites us to read the text with the truest — that is, with the least conventional, platitudinous, or even pious—understandings available to us.

This is so because the Torah text that seems so plainly "there" can be approached only by the strenuous and imaginative "making" of the reader. This "making" has much to do with the intimate experience of the human being in the world; more than that, according to Jewish mystical and exegetical sources, it is God's will of the readers of His book. Whenever, for instance, the Torah speaks of the imperative _la'asot_, usually translated "to fulfil, to obey," the words of the Torah, the Netziv of Volozhin, author of _Ha'amek Davar_, consistently translates "to construct the meaning of the words of the Torah." _La'asot_ indicates the "making," the creation of Torah in the mind of the reader. This is not passive receptivity, but expresses a post-Kantian understanding of the active processes of perception.

If this reading of personal history in the Torah is not to degenerate into a "reading into the Torah," there should, of course, be rules, decorums, a sense of traditional understandings. But ultimately, what I have attempted in these essays is to articulate a personal meditation on themes evoked by the biblical text. This may perhaps be termed an eisegetical, rather than an exegetical, approach. It takes its cue from the kind of reading of Torah that one poignant midrash sets in sharp focus. Rarely, indeed, is the act of reading the subject of midrashic narration. Here, however, the midrash powerfully reflects on its own enterprise.

In this passage (_Yalkut Shimoni_ 1, 764), God asks Moses to help Him with the difficult task of telling Aaron that he is to die:

> God said to Moses, "Do Me a favor and tell Aaron about his death, for I am ashamed to tell him." Said R. Huna in the name of R. Tanhum bar Hiyya: What did Moses do? He rose early in the morning and went over to Aaron's place. He began calling out [_korei_], "Aaron, my brother!" Aaron came down to him and asked, "How is that you have come here so early today?" Moses answered, "There is a davar, a thing/word, a problem from the Torah that I was mulling over [_mebarher_] during the night, and it gave me great difficulty. That is why I have come over to visit you so early in the morning." Aaron asked, "What is the problem?" Moses answered, "I don't know what it was—but I do know that it is in the book of Genesis. Bring it, and let us read [_nikra_] in it." They took the book of Genesis and read in it, story by story, and at each one, Aaron said, "God did well, He created well." But when they came to the creation of Adam, Moses said, "What shall I say about Adam who brought death to the world?" Aaron replied, "My brother Moses, you surely would not say that in this we do not accept the decree of God? We have read how Adam and Eve were created and how they merited thirteen wedding canopies, as it said, 'You were in Eden, the garden of God' (Ezekiel 28:13), and how Adam ate of the Tree, and was told, For dust you are, and to dust you shall return (Genesis 3:19) — and after all this glory, that they should come to this ..." Then Moses said, "What about me &ndash; who had control over the ministering angels? and what about you &ndash; who halted the spread of death? Is our end not the same? We have another few years to live &ndash; perhaps twenty years?" Aaron said, "That is only a few years." Then Moses brought the number down more and more, until he spoke of the very day of death. Immediately, Aaron's bones felt as if they were quaking. He said, "Perhaps the _davar_, the word, the thing, was for me?" Moses answered, "Yes." Immediately, the Israelites saw that his stature had shrunk, as it is said, "The whole community saw that Aaron was about to die" [lit., had died] (Numbers 20:29). Then Aaron said, "My heart is dead within me, and the terror of death has fallen upon me." Moses asked him, "Do you accept death?" And he answered, "Yes ..."

Moses is faced with the task that God Himself finds shameful. How to tell Aaron of his imminent death? He approaches the subject by indirection, through a reading experience in the book of Genesis. In doing so, he models for us a way of reading. He introduces his project by "calling out" (_korei_) to his brother: the word is identical with the word for reading &ndash; "Let us read in the book of Genesis." This gives us a sense that to read &ndash; especially to read the _mikra_, the Bible &ndash; is to call out for response to a text that itself calls out, summons, and addresses the reader. Essentially, to read is to invite the text to yield up its meanings.

In this case, Moses and Aaron will read in order to find the lost &ndash; the word, the idea that troubled Moses during the night. _Meharher_, the word I translate here as "mulling over," has connotations of agitation; Moses recalls being uneasy over a thought, an image, a problem from the Torah, which he now can no longer remember. He proposes to search for it in the book of Genesis, the book of beginnings, where the origins of all things are to be found. We have a sense that the _davar_ is of utter &ndash; and threatening—importance. Perhaps we should understand that Moses has, in fact, repressed his memory of God's mission. It is no fiction that he is presenting to Aaron, not a strategy to communicate his brother's impending death but a real experience in which God's word has disappeared from his memory, leaving only an intuition that the book of Genesis will yield it back again.

There follows a poignant scene, in which Aaron enthusiastically endorses the narratives of creation. Clearly, he reads with his whole being, almost comically applauding God for the beauty (_yafeh assd_) of His making of the world. It is Moses who asks the dark question of death.Aaron at first gives the theologically correct, Job-like answer
(reminiscent of Job's retort to his wife, "Should we accept only good from God and not accept evil?" [Job 2:10]). In the context of the whole narrative of creation, human sin and punishment, death has its organic place. Moses then reads himself and Aaron into the text, making death a matter of personal, looming, and tragic import, until Aaron reluctantly (_sbema_ evokes an unwilling thought) realizes, "Perhaps the word, the mystery, the terror is _for me_?"

Moses has interrogated the text of the book of Genesis by bringing it into the closest confrontation with the lives of Aaron and himself. He challenges Aaron to a sense of pain and outrage at the very idea of death — and then mobilizes his brother's acquiescence to the tragic narrative in a personal acceptance of death. The result of this reading of biblical narrative is much more than the conveying of information: Aaron not only learns of his death, but experiences its imminence, in a dialectical mode of fear ("his bones quaked") and acquiescence. He can contain this tension, only because it is generated by a way of reading the Bible. Strangely, with all the terror of such an intimate reading comes a sense of destiny, of existing in the mind of God, of being oneself the subject of God's word.

Such a reading—initiated and guided by Moses (our Teacher, as he is commonly named) — is not a matter of reading personal concerns into the text. Rather, it is a responsive summons to the meanings inherent within the text, that await the "hearing" reader. Moses, more questioning, more restless, is also a better reader than his brother. He is not entranced by the words of the text, but senses what is hidden in the spaces between the letters, in the silences between the words.

What is hidden is, essentially, the reader's most intimate life, the things and words of the night, fears and longings and questionings. It is these that I have tried to "hear" from within the text of the Torah.

In terms of these underlying—and often subversive—concerns, the essay on _Parshat Bereshit_ can be read as a kind of "preamble" to this book and to Genesis as a whole. The belfry daydream, which represents the vertical, distant, theoretical perspective, is opposed to the swarming, earthbound dimension of mass human and animal life. The tension between the two, the paradox of the human situation, cross-chained, in Kafka's image, to both axes, throttled by one or the other chain, yields no resolution. Kafka points up the beauty and absurdity of the human response: "And yet all the possibilities are his, and he feels it; more, he actually refuses to account for the deadlock by an error in the original fettering."[^4]

The experience of highest tension, between immanence and transcendence,between the limits of human experience and the "signals of transcendence" that are secreted within these limits, is what draws me in the biblical texts and in the midrashic and later versions of those texts. There is a sense of the turning point, the fulcrum of transformation that affects the characters in their relations to God, to each other, and to themselves.

Ultimately, the interpretive act becomes similar to the creative act. One reads, and one begins to hear a certain hum in one's ears. I think of Nadezhda Mandelstan's account of how her husband would begin to write a new poem: "a poem begins with a musical phrase ringing insistently in the ears; at first inchoate, it later takes on a precise form ... I have a feeling that verse exists before it is composed ... The whole process of composition is one of straining to catch and record something compounded of harmony and sense as it is relayed from an unknown source and gradually forms itself into words. The last stage of the work consists in ridding the poem of all the words foreign to the harmonious whole which existed before the poem arose."[^5]

The hum in the ears of the reader generates a personal response to the text. There are, of course, decorums and limits to be observed; but the intimate encounter between self and text must create something new, something neither "stale" nor "shabby," in Wallace Stevens's words, but with that essential "this-ness," which is the classic midrashic description of what it is to "receive" the Torah:

> "_On this very day_, they entered the wilderness of Sinai": the words of Torah should be new to you as though they were given this very day. (Rashi, Exodus 19:1)

<b>A note to the reader</b>

There is no doctrinaire intent in my usage in this book of the traditional forms of reference to God as "He" nor to the use of "man" for humanity. I am aware that these are sensitive issues, but in order to avoid stylistic awkwardness, I have followed the JPS translation, particularly in the "Creation" and "Flood" narratives.
