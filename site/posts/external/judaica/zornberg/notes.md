2. Michael Fishbane, _Text and Texture_ (Schocken: 1979), 8.
3. Bereshit Rabbah\_ 5:3. Other sources are quoted in the commentary of
   Rabbenu Bahya on Leviticus 2:13. R. Hutner bases a discussion of the
   problematics of human free choice on this midrash (Pa&#x1e25;ad Yitz&#x1e25;ak, Rosh Hashanah 13:1).
4. Rosh Hashanah 31a: "The Psalm assigned to the second day of the
   week is Psalm 48, beginning, 'The Lord is great and much acclaimed/
   because on the second day He divided up His works and reigned over them."
5. J. Berakhot 1:5.
6. E.g., _Va-yikra Rabbah_ 14:9.
7. E.g., _Bereshit Rabbah_ 20:17: "The woman in childbirth vacillates
   about the costs of her sexual role; she therefore is obligated to bring a 'fluttering' sacrifice [birds]"!

   Governance Stated Narratively", in _Genesis: Modern Critical Interpretations_, ed. Harold Bloom (Chelsea House: 1986), 17.

11. Gaston Bachelard, _The Poetics of Space_ (Beacon Press: 1969), 173.
12. See 9:1-2, 6-7: "God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, 'Be fertile and increase, and fill the earth. The fear and dread of you shall be upon all the beasts of the earth and upon all the birds of the sky— everything with which the earth is astir [_tirmoss_] — and upon all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hand... Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; For in His image, did God make man. Be fertile, then, and increase; abound [_shirtzu_] on the earth and increase on it.'" The Rabbis (see Rashi, 9:6) define this as both a blessing and a commandment—the imperative of "apres le deluge." Even the word _sheretz_, with its specifically reptilian quality, is now incorporated into the imperative of human fertility. But here, too, the proliferation motif is set beside the motif of man's godlikeness.

44. The word _etzev_ occurs again in this early part of the biblical narrative, when Adam is punished: "Cursed be the ground because of you; by toil [_beitzavon_] shall you eat of it" (3:17). Rashi's comment stresses the unpredictable, willful nature of the earths response to man's curse. Man will be compelled by necessity to accept the "thorns and thistles", that the earth will offer him, after he has invested his best resources in it. This doom is reflected again later, when Noah is born, and there is new hope for "relief from our work and for the toil [_itz'von_] of our hands, out of the very soil which the Lord placed under a curse" (5:29). There, again, Rashi reiterates his theme of _itzavon_ as the frustration of the worker who sows wheat and reaps thorns and thistles. There, _itzavon_ is clearly associated with the "hands-on" involvement and risks that are confronted by creativity.

64. See _Bereshit Rabbah_ 17:5 for an account of man's "wisdom" in naming not only the animals but himself and God too.
65. The pivotal role of language is stressed by Rashi. God asks, redundantly, "Where are you?" only in order that Adam's version of his experience should not be inhibited by fear. God's desire is to "enter into words with him." Adam's response is inadequate to the occasion.
66. See the complex image of the cradle, in which man sleeps before Creation (_Bereshit Rabhah_ 2:3). The earth-nurse watches the cradle with apprehension (_toha u-boha_) the sleeping infant is contained, at peace, in this primary reality. But a secondary reality is already implicit: the sleeping child will awake to his full powers and destroy both himself and the world.
67. Another version of Rashi: On the sixth of Sivan, when Israel received the Torah, all the works of beginning were strengthened, and it was as if the world was created then.

86. Shestov quotes Spinoza as representative of the "Athenian" conception of a reality entirely constrained by Necessity: non ridere, non lugere, neque detestari, sed intellegere—"not to laugh, not lament, not to curse, but to understand" (_Athens and Jerusalem_, 195).
87. Richard Rorty, _Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity_ (Cambridge University Press: 1989), 96.
88. The skeptic asks: "Does God see the nolad— that which is born...?" R. Yehoshua answers: "_Nolad_? Was there born to you a son?" His retort brings the "philosopher" down to earth, to the existential knowledge of fathers of mortal children. It is here, and not in the sublime certainties of metaphysical knowledge, that human understanding of God begins.

NOAH

1. There is a midrash that connects Noah's birth with Adam's death, and
   the end of the curse ("Cursed be the ground because of you . . . until you
   return to the ground" [3:17, 19]). (Psikta d'Rabbi Eliezer, in Torah Shelemah
   5:81).
2. Martin Buber, "The Tree of Knowledge," in On the Bible (Schocken:
   1982), 17.
3. Joseph is also described as "righteous," in Amos 2:6, and he, too, is
   described as feeding and sustaining his world.
4. See Ramban on 6:9.
5. See 6:5, 12-13, 17; 7:4.
6. Bereshit Rabbah 29:4
7. Compare Torah Shelemah 6:3 7 on the wordplay of gopher (the wood of
   the ark) and gophrit (sulfurous fire).
8. Tanhuma, Re'eh, 3.
9. See Rashi on Genesis 6:4: one third of the world was flooded in the
   time of Enosh.
10. See Rashi on 6:13.
11. See Ramban on 7:18: "The waters swelled. . . ."
12. Rashi's main source is Bereshit Rabbah 26:5.
13. Bereshit Rabbah 32:8.
14. See, for example, Tanhuma, Ba-midbar, 26.
15. The reference to the Tower of Babel generation is missing from the
    first edition of Rashi. There are, however, midrashic sources that suggest that
    at least some of the builders of the Tower were also destroyed. See Bereshit

Notes
387
Rabbah 38:16. This midrash plays on the words va-yafetz and va-yatzef—
"God scattered the builders" becomes "God swept them away." 16. Tanhuma, Tissa, 17. 17. Tanhuma, Va-yera, 8. 18. Tanhuma Yashan, Va-yera 10. 19. Bereshit Rabbah 52:8. 20. Va-yikra Rabbah 20:2. 21. Bereshit Rabbah 28:2. 22. Tanhuma, Noah, 11. 23. See, for example, Sefat Emet 5662, p.40. 24. Sifrei, Ha'azinu, 7.
2 5. Leviticus 20:17: "If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his
father or his mother, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness,
it is a disgrace (hesed hu)" Rashi notes that in Aramaic hisuda is the term for
"disgrace"—which leaves us with the paradox oihesed as root for two contrary
ideas, "grace" and "disgrace." Ramban clearly finds this distasteful and
asserts (claiming the support of the Sages) that hesed posits the right,  
generous mode of relationship that the sinner is transgressing: instead of  
disinterested concern to marry off his sister, he demonstrates selfish lust.  
However, the radical possibilities in a paradoxical conception of hesed remain
intriguing. 26. Bereshit Rabbah 26:5. 27. See Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger (Penguin: 1966), 145, on the
dangers inherent in margins. 28. See Bachelard, Poetics of Space, 224: "How concrete everything  
becomes in the world of the spirit when an object, a mere door, can give images
of hesitation, temptation, desire, security, welcome and respect. If one were
to give an account of all the doors one has closed and opened, of all the doors
one would like to re-open, one would have to tell the story of one's entire
life." 29. Bereshit Rabbah 38:6. 30. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, 177-78. 31. Ibid., 165. 32. Ibid., 163. 33. Ibid., 158. 34. Ibid., 160. 35. Bachelard, Poetics of Space, 222. 36. See Rashi, 6:11. Targum Onkelos translates hamas (which Rashi, in
the wake of the midrash, translates zsgezel, "robbery") with the word hatufin,
"snatching," "rapaciousness." 37. See Bereshit Rabbah 27:3 for an analogy between the uses of the word
rabbah in both narratives and the fates of both worlds.

388
Noah 38. NahumM. Sarna, Understanding Genesis (Schocken: 1970), 52. 39. Rambam, Misbneb Torab, Hilkhot Melakbim 9:14. 40. The requirement oidinim—of instituting the structures of legality in
society— is one of the Seven Noachide Commandments. 41. See Beresbit Rabbab 70:12. 42. B. Sanhedrin 108b. See also Meshekb Hokbmah on 8:19. 43. Gordon S. Haight, George Eliot: A Biography (Clarendon Press: 1968), 464. 44. Tanhuma, Noah, 7. 45. See his commentary to Job 24:20. 46. Beresbit Rabbab 29:4. 47. Andre Neher, The Exile of the Word (Jewish Publication Society:
1981), 101. 48. Tanhuma, Noah, 5. See also Rashi, 6:14. 49. Sexually, too, he refuses to articulate his being: he has children late in
life (at 500 [5:32]) "because of the sin of his generation, which he saw. Only
when God told him to build the ark, he married and had children, a hundred
years before the Flood" (Ba-midbar Rabbab 14:12). 50. Beresbit Rabbab 30:9. 51. Ibid., 31:19. 52. Emmanuel Levinas, Totality and Infinity (Duquesne University Press:
1969), 110-15. 53. Ibid., 116. 54. "The righteous man knows the needs of his beast" has traditionally
been understood to refer to this relation to ones own needs, and their wise
management. 55. Tanhuma, Noah, 9. 56. See Ramban 6:19 57. Beresbit Rabbab 32:4. 58. Ibid, 32:8. 59. Ma'aseh Ha-shem 68:1. See also Targum Onkelos. 60. Bachelard, Poetics of Space, 224 61. See Tanbuma, Noah, 11, and our earlier discussion of this midrash.
This reading is based on the fact that Noah and his sons are listed separately
from their wives, in the original instructions to enter the ark (6:18; 7:7; 7:13),
but in pairs when they are told to leave the ark (8:16) —and, in the same
breath, God tells them of the fertility-imperative implicit in "coming out."
Noah, however, leaves in sexually segregated groups (8:18). 62. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 23. 63. Shakespeare, Hamlet, II, ii, 257. 64. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 23.

Notes
389 65. Baal Ha-Turim suggests that Og is a decoding of the words "Only
Noah," since they have the same numerical value (gematriya). This would
imply an intimate—perhaps dialectical—relation between the Noah who is
enclosed in the ark and the obsessional force of the giant king. 66. Bachelard, Poetics of Space\ 222-23. 67. See Rashi, 8:13, and B. Rosh Hashanah 12b. 68. Beresbit Rabbab 18:1. 69. Ibid., 18:3. 70. John Keats, "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer." 71. Beresbit Rabbab, 34:8 72. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 23. 73. "You have brought us into a net" (v.l 1); "We have come into fire and
water" (v. 12); "You have brought us out to the fresh air" (v. 12). Ibn Ezra reads
revaya as air, neither desiccating like fire, nor obliterating like water. Fire and
water are both dimensions of the Flood in midrashic literature. 74. See Radal on Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer chap. 23. 75. See Tanbuma, Tavo, 1. 76. Compare 6:5. 77. Rabbenu Bahya 8:21. 78.

LEKH LEKHA

   Arthur Mitchell (Modern Library: 1944), 323.
2. Beresbit Rabbab 38:21.
3. It is interesting to notice, however, that the first tin in the Torah (2:5)
   speaks of the absence of Man himself. ("When the Lord God made earth and
   heaven—when no shrub of the field was yet on earth and no grasses of the
   field had yet sprouted, because the Lord God had not sent rain upon the earth
   and there was no man — adam ayin — to till the soil. . . .") Without human
   consciousness of need and desire, without the experience of the "peculiar
   possibility of the negative," there can be no prayer, indeed no reality that is
   humanly appropriated. See Rashi's comment on this passage.
4. Ramban, 12:1.
5. Cf. ibid., 20:13.
6. Cf. Rashi's comment on me-artzkba (12:1) — " 'Go forth . . . from your

390
Lekh Lekha
land1: Move even further away from there" —his native land he has already
left with his father: the point now is to move on, away, with no specified
destination. 7. Tanhuma, Lekh Lekha, 3. 8. Y'lamdenu, quoted in Torah Shelemab 12:107. 9. See Rashi on this verse: " 'Therefore shall a man leave\* \ The Holy Spirit
makes this declaration, forbidding incest to all mankind." The incestuous
bond is primary not only chronologically, in the history of the child's  
development, but culturally and spiritually. A primal unity must be ruptured in
order that generation take place—the removal of the rib from Adam's body
becomes in Rashi's comment the paradigm for abenation-become-fruition. 10. Bereshit Rabbah 53:6. 11. Ibid., 39:16. The imagery of coinage suggests the capacity to "mint"
and reproduce, to beget in one's own image. Abraham and Sarah come to
represent a transformative mode that captures the human imagination. 12. Cf. the commentary of Etz Yosef: "Their two situations that are
reversed by the lovingkindness of God." 13. Tanbuma, Lekh Lekha, 3. 14. Rambam, Mishneh Torah y Hilkhot Teshuva 2:4. 15. B. RoshHashanah 16b. 16. My wordplay on krVah and akirah, with their identical but inverted
root letters, is not, I hope, entirely perverse. The state of  
alienation/barrenness (akirah) is one of ground torn away (kri'ah) — filaments of connection
with past and future rent apart. Discontinuity is the essential experience
Abraham comes to represent. 17. Midrash Ha-Gadol 12:1. 18. Cf. Rashi: " 'Lekh lekha': Go from your land — for your good, for your
benefit" (12:1). 19. See the comment of the Netziv on "And Abram went as God had told
him" (12:4) —"Abram went instantly\ in response to God's word." 20. William James, The Varieties ofReligious Experience (Fontana: 1960), 201. 21. Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Avodah Zarah 1:3. 22. Thomas S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (University of
Chicago Press: 1962), 55. 23. Ibid., 62. 24. Ibid., 63. 25. Ibid., 64. 26. Ibid., 65. 27. But see ibid., 208: his theses should be of wide applicability, "for they
are borrowed from other fields." Kuhn claims originality mainly in applying
them to the sciences.

See, e.g., Isaiah 22:17 and Va-yikra Rabbah 5:5. 34. Bereshit Rabbah 39:2. 35. Ibid., 39:1. 36. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, 30. 37. Peter Berger, A Rumor of Angels (Anchor: 1970). 38. See, e.g., Sefat Emet 5648. 39. JPS translates ohavi, "my friend." See also B. Sotah 32b. 40. Rambam, Misbneh Torah, Hilkhot Teshuva 10:3. 41. Cf. 1 Samuel 26:21 and Proverbs 5:19. 42. In his comment on Proverbs 5:19, he cites an Arabic source for the
translation, "preoccupation"; and then adds the rabbinic reading, which
emphasizes "distraction." 43. Cf. Deuteronomy 28:34: "until you are driven mad by what your eyes
behold." And the comment of Haamek Davar. the madness comes not from
physical suffering but from the disruption of normal causal relationships. 44. W. B. Yeats, Easter, 1916. 45. Conversely, language always conspires to close off as it discloses
meaning: "There is also another sense in which we can never quite close our
fists over meaning, which arises from the fact that language is a temporal
process. When I read a sentence, the meaning of it is always somehow
suspended, something deferred or still to come" (Terry Eagleton, Literary
Theory [University of Minnesota Press: 1983], 128). Deferral, writes George
Steiner (Real Presences [University of Chicago Press: 1989], 122) is "that
postponement of settled signification, that keeping in flickering motion
which adjourns the illusion, the sterile fixity of meaning."
Note that Rashi has changed the text of his source in Bereshit Rabbah,
which speaks of a reward for each step, an image obviously more appropriate,
as Abraham sets out on a journey, each step of which is shrouded in doubt.
Perhaps Rashi is thinking primarily of his supporting prooftexts, where
delayed language is an appropriate expression of indeterminacy. The third
example Rashi gives ("on one of the mountains") is his own addition to the
quotations in Bereshit Rabbah: for him, evidently, this theme is central to the
Abraham idea, and it is crucial to consider the three quotations as an organic
structure. 46. E.g., Sifrei Deuteronomy, 326: "When God punishes Israel, He, as it
were, regrets it." J. Nedarim, 9, 41b: "Is not regret of a vow like a novel
[unforeseen] circumstance?" Shemot Rabbah, 43:11: in Moses' prayer of

392
Lekb Lekba
intercession, "Turn back from Your burning anger and think better of the
evil decreed against Your people" (Exodus 32:12), the word for "think
better" (hinnahem) is translated, "Let tehiya exist for You." 47. Cf. B. Shavuot 17a: "When he did not stand still, he walked  
constantly." B. Berakhot 5a: "The pious spend an hour in silent contemplation
before prayer." B. Berakhot 32b: "They would contemplate an hour, pray an
hour, and again contemplate an hour."
Compare George Steiner's discussion of Derrida's "famous neologism,
la difference, [which] is crucial to the deconstnictionist and post-structuralist
counter-theology of absence." Particularly in the sense of "deferral" — "that
postponement of settled signification, that keeping in flickering motion
which adjourns the illusion, the sterile fixity of definition" (Real Presences,
P 122). 48. Cf. B. Yevamot 36b: "A human birth that survived thirty days is not
considered an abortion." 49. The expression is borrowed from John Keats, "On First Looking into
Chapman's Homer" Compare B. Hulin 75b: "Reish Lakish gazed at him
(when R. Yohanan gave his opinion) and was silent." 50. Note that the double cry, "Abraham! Abraham!" as God's angel
reveals himself after the Akedah (22:11) is described by Rashi as "an  
expression of love [biba]" Here, God reciprocates Abraham's love, after the  
suspension in space and time is resolved. 51. Cf. R. D. Laing's clinical description of akarut as peril and  
opportunity:
Something happens that is incompatible with [this] pivotal
identity, perhaps hidden, that determines his whole system of
meaning. A linch-pin is removed that had been holding a whole
world together, The whole meaning of reality crumbles. It
'fakesthe groundfrom under his feet" [my italics]. Participation in
the world, such terms as "contact with" and "sense of reality"
are empty sounds. A desperate crisis indeed. Either one  
restructures one's whole "real" view of others and the world and
redefines one's "real" self; or one annuls the chasm between
what is the case and what one knows to be the case, by taking
one's stand on what one knows. There is nothing more real and
indubitable than pure phantasy; nothing more obvious;  
nothing less necessary and more easy to prove. (Self and Others
[Penguin: 1961], 93) 52. The repeated second-person singular possessive suffix in the lekb
lekba summons—"Go forth from your land, your birthplace, your father's
house" brings an almost hypnotic focus to bear on self. This suggests a
fascination in abandonment.

Notes
393 53. Compare the use Rashi makes of the words terufznA meshugga in his
account of the drowning of the Egyptians. Their self-infatuation gives them a
fatal buoyancy that will not allow them the mercy of a quick death. 54. Frank Kermode, The Genesis of Secrecy (Harvard University Press:
1979), 145. 55. The text discussed in the Talmud is "Today you have become the
people of the Lord" (Deuteronomy 27:9). "Today" suggests a "double
exposure" effect: the day of Moses' speaking, or indeed the day of the reader's
reading, becomes elided with the day of the Giving of the Torah on Sinai. 56. Cf. the comment of Ha'amek Davar on Exodus 19:19. 57. Tanhuma, Miketz, 2. 58. See Rashi on Exodus 6:9, citing B. Sanhedrin Ilia. 59. Bereshit Kabbah, 44:6. 60. Ibid., 57:2. Cf. Rashi on 22:20. The midrash is apparently playing on
the similarity between ahar ha-devarim ha-ekh ("after these things") and
hirburim. 61. Cf. Isaiah 59:13. 62. B. Niddah 16b. 63. It is interesting to notice the "timing" of Abraham's hirburim, in the
midrashic sources—e.g. Bereshit Rabbah 56:12: "Abraham began to wonder:
All these events are bewildering—yesterday You told me, 'In Isaac, seed shall
be named for you'; then You said, 'Please take your son'; and now You tell me,
'Do not stretch out your hand against the boy\* —I am full of wonder!" It is
only after a certain crisis of commitment is past that he opens himself to the
complex contradictions (literally, the counterdictions—mutually exclusive
speech acts) of his situation: characteristically, after these things. Compare
also the version of this midrash in J. Ta'anit 2:4: "Master of the universe, it is
fully revealed to You that at the time that You told me to offer up my son, / had
what to answer You?' The timing of Abraham's musings on contradiction is of
the essence here. "I had a response" indicates the thought that is immediately
submerged in the movement of love for God. Only when he has acted out that
commitment do the full implications of contradiction surge up in his mind.
This is the time for meaning-making. 64. J. Huizinga, Homo Ludens (Routledge and Kegan Paul: 1949), 13.
Huizinga defines play as "a free activity standing quite consciously outside
'ordinary' life as being 'not serious,' but at the same time absorbing the player
intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and
no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of
time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner." 65. Midrash Ha-Gadol, Genesis 12:1 66. Chaos, the formless emptiness of the uncreated world, is described in
Genesis as tohu va-vohu: the cosmological dimension of a full emptiness out

of which everything is engendered holds both horror and fascination for
human beings, whose essential need is for structure. (See Rashi's comment
on these words, Genesis 1:2.) Tebiya is tobu on the existential plane. 67. Tanbuma, Lekh Lekha, 2. 68. In Pahad Yitzhak (Pesah, 17:5), Rav Yitzhak Hutner explores the
theme of the necessity of the question. Often, he suggests, the answer is in
greater need of a good question than the question is in need of an answer.
Only when imperfection, need, tension are authentically experienced, (the
"anomaly" of which Kuhn writes) does man progress toward wholeness.
Resolution without tension is a joyless triumph. In these terms, Rav Hutner
discusses the indeterminacy of Abraham's journey: knowledge comes to him
"as the answer to a real question, not as an arbitrary answer" — as response to
an existence fabricated out of questions. "When God caused me to wander
away from my father's house" (Genesis 20:13) — "God led me to know Him
precisely through the experiences of felt not-knowing." 69. Kuhn, Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 87. 70. Sefat Emet 5648.
VA-YERA

1. "Take please": Na is an expression of request. God said to Abraham,
   "Please stand firm for Me in this test, so that people should not say, The first
   tests had no substance to them."
2. B. Sanhedrin 89b.
3. See Genesis 12:7-8 and 13:4.
4. Isaiah 41:8.
5. Rashi's comment is based on Tanbuma, Shelah, 14. It is interesting to
   notice that in the original midrash, the prooftext is, "Go, eat your bread in
   gladness ... for your action was long ago approved by God" (Ecclesiastes
   9:7). Abraham is vindicated and the effect is—bathetically? — that he can
   return to his se'udah, to the feasting that generated the doubts that made the
   test necessary in the first place.

Notes
395 15. Cf. the discussion in Bereshit Rabbah 48:16, as to whether the angels
really ate, or only appeared to eat. 16. Cf. Ruth 3:7: "Boaz ate and drank, and in a cheerful mood went to lie
down"; and the comment in Ruth Rabbah: " Hn a cheerful mood" (lit., his heart
was good) — he made a blessing over his food. Or, he ate a variety of sweets that
train the tongue for Torah." The implication is that Boaz is fully nurtured by
the world, and can make use of reality: by an act of alchemy, food is
metabolized to creative play in Torah. (See Likutei Moharan 1, 19:7.) 17. Cf. Harvey Cox, in Feast of Fools (Harper and Row: 1969), writes of the
prodigality and fantasy, the "calculated excess" implied in feasting and living
it up, dressing up. Cf. Abraham's teaching to Sarah: "This is no time for
austerity [modesty] — uncover your breasts and nurse all the princes of the
world!" (Bereshit Rabbah 53:13). 18. B. Sotah 10b. Cf. Rashi on this verse. 19. See Rashi on this verse: "hotel, a place where the stranger is lodged,

Sanhedrin 89b—se 'udah—is rooted in the invitation that Abraham extends to
the angels — "SaWh libkhem" — "you may refresh yourselves" —lit., support
your heart (18:5). This is the primary concept of eating; as Rashi points out,
the expression "heart support" is used throughout Scriptures for "food."
What Abraham is offering is an experience in which dependency is overcome
and the hazards of growth and separation are mediated. 25. See Rashi on 7:23. 26. Tanhuma, Lekh Lekha, 12. 27. R. Hutner, Pahad Yitzhak, Pesah, 18:5. 28. Cf. B. Yevamot 79a, where this source is chosen as the prooftext for

thousand years before Abraham's time: the fully human phase of "sons of
men" begins with Abraham, whose work it is to grow "sons of men" out of
the culture of a merely potential universe. 49. "The Hermeneutic Quest in Robinson Crusoe" in Midrash and

they returned." 43. Compare verbs of hastening in both narratives. 44. This is the root of Jonahs anger at God's hesed to Nineveh. The effect
of such hesed is mere unintelligibility. The world continues as though there
were no justice, no judge. To Jonah, this is an outrage against emet, the Truth,
that is so conspicuously missing from his list of divine attributes (4:2).
Without Truth, hesed seems to him a deplorable, even self-destructive foible
of God. 45. Cf. Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Teshuva, chap. 7, in which Rambam
traces the complexities of sin, penitence, reward, and punishment. Rambam
reiterates constantly that the transcendent truth is in no way derivable from
experience. On the contrary, "Do not say. . . . ," "Let the penitent not
imagine that. . . . ," "A person should always see himself as though. . . ." 46. See Rashi, 24:14. 47. Bereshit Rabbah 60:2. 48. See, for instance, the injunction, "Azov ta yazov into—You shall indeed
come to the aid of your enemy, whose donkey has collapsed under its burden"
(Exodus 23:5). The ambiguities and rhetorical questions involved in this text
are the subject of much rabbinic commentary. For an unequivocal example of
azav as "reinforcement," see Nehemiah 3:8. 49. Neher, Exile of the Word, 285-86. 50. This is not a moment of joy; for doubt and suspense make awkward
bedfellows with joy. The legacy of Sarah's death is her last cry. According to
the Midrash Ha-Gadol (2 3:2), Kiryat Arba, the place of her death ("the city of
four"), is called so because of her four death cries—expressing sadness on
hearing her son's fate; wailing for her son; the bitterness of her death; and
mourning for the fact that there is no perfect joy. These carefully  
differentiated modes culminate in the "reversibility of joy," as the Midrash OrAfela
has it. Realization of the volatile nature of experience and consciousness is not
easily neutralized. 51. Bereshit Rabbah 60:14. 52. See the commentary of Ha'amek Davar on this meeting.

Toledot 3. Ibid., 67:4. 4. Ramban focuses on the unexpectedness of Isaac's reply. He  
mobilizes this to intensify the outrage of Isaac's question, which now covers the
involuntary nature of the blessing: he trembles all the more violently for
knowing that the blessing is a reality, in spite of his intention and present
feeling. 5. Beresbit Rabbah 67:3. 6. Compare "And Jacob called his sons" (49:1), which introduces his
deathbed blessings. 7. Beresbit Rabbah 67:10. 8. Ibid., 78:14. 9. Rashi is reponding here to the past tense form of berakbtani. He
translates literally, "till you admit my having been blessed, in the past." 10. Sarna, Understanding Genesis; 188. 11. Ramban, 27:12 12. B. Sanhedrin 92a. 13. Midrash Misblei 10:17. 14.

The striking feature of this version of the midrash is that Abraham
cannot come to his own just assessment of the facts, even after God has
changed Isaac's appearance. It is because of the consensus of opinion of
others, who can see both father and son, that Abraham's suspicions are
allayed. The visual factor, the criterion of perspective and opinion, remains
central, even after the miracle. 20. Lionel Trilling discusses this concept, and its relation to the  
"sentiments of art," in Sincerity and Authenticity (Harvard University Press: 1971),

focusing his energies on the point of his arrow. 39. Bereshit Rabbah 63:15. 40. Shakespeare, Hamlet, I, ii, 133-34. 41. Plato, Protagoras, 345D. 42. Shestov, Athens and Jerusalem, 89. 43.

love and blessing (a libidinal energy that is now poignantly focused on food,
but that, in some form, is essential to the act of blessing, see Ramban, Bahya).

the savage who "lives within himself*' with the sociable man who "knows
how to live only in the opinion of others, and it is, so to speak, from their
judgment alone that he draws the sentiment of his own being** (quoted in
Trilling, 62). 70. Shakespeare, Hamlet, I, ii, 76. 71. Rashi comments on "I ate of it all**: "All delicacies that I sought to
taste, I tasted in his food.'\* Isaac experiences the triumph of the desiring
imagination, fusing the sensual with the spiritual—a similar notion to the
classic midrashic descriptions of the taste of the manna, and the experience of
receiving the Torah at Mount Sinai. 72. Compare Abarbanel's reading of lo hikiro. Unlike most  
commentators, he translates, "he did not identify him,** rather than "he did not
recognize him." 73. In the Beresbit Rabbah source, Jacob describes his anokhi differently:
"/ am destined to receive the Ten Commandments**— a word-play on the
opening statement of the Ten Commandments: "lam the Lord your God.\*'
In this reading, Jacob's identity will find full standing only in the anokhi
encounter of Sinai, where man will achieve an unprecedented strength to
"stand** in the presence of God. [See essay on "Bereshit,*' especially pp. 20-
36.] See also the comment of Ibn Ezra on Jacob's "disinformation:" he rejects

refer to the field, on the one hand, and to "my son," on the other. "The smell

VA-YISHLAH

1. Midrashic tradition associates this death with the death of Rebecca
   herself— a covert way of referring to a death too painful to describe. (/Illon is
   "other" in Greek: "another weeping" encodes a reference to an undescribed
   death.) See Rashi and Ramban, 35:8.
2. Compare the disagreement between Rashi and Ramban on whether
   the following clause—"the Lord shall be my God"—belongs to the condition
   or the promise part of the vow.
3. Compare the terms of Rebecca's directions to him: "Stay [ve-
   yashavta] with him" (27:44). "He stayed with him a month's time" (29:14). In
   retrospect, what had at the time been experienced as a real settling and
   cooperation dwindles into an episode, radically unimportant. There may, of
   course, be a tactical element in Jacob's presentation of himself to his brother
   as unchanged.
4. See Rashi: Jacob is afraid to repeat God's words, crediting Isaac with a
   relationship to God, even while he is still alive and his "godliness" is still in
   question.
5. B. Megillah 17a.
6. The moral question about Dinah's responsibility for her own fate
   does not arise in these midrashic treatments. To all intents and purposes,
   Dinah becomes a dream figure in Jacob's consciousness—as, indeed, do all
   the characters in his narrative—as the midrash traces the patterns, shadowy
   and often repressed, of his experience.
7. See Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 35: "Jacob fell on his face on the ground,
   in front of the Stone of Foundation, and prayed to God: Master of all worlds,
   if you bring me back to this place in wholeness, I will sacrifice before You
   offerings of thanks and burnt offerings—as it is said, 'And Jacob made a
   vow.'" Targum Jonathan also indicates that the core meaning of a vow is
   sacrifice.

14. Before this, only God has made promises; and—as Rashi comments
    in a classic passage (Exodus 6:3-8)—His promises have made human beings
    peculiarly aware of the "dangerous" quality of words unfulfilled.
15. See Rashi Ha-Shalem on 3 5:1, for a list of sources using either of these
    formulations.

408
Va-Yishlah 16. Maharal describes the connection differently: Jacob's tragic flaw,
expressed covertly when he withholds Dinah from Esau, becomes visible,
cries out to high heaven, after he has delayed on his return home. His delay
acts as a catalyst: the ledgers fall open for rigorous inspection (Gur Arye,
32:22). 17. Bereshit Kabbah 76:9. 18. Saint Augustine, The City of God (Hafner Library: 1948), 78-81. 19. Bereshit Kabbah 80:3. 20. B. Megillah 18a. 21. Bereshit Kabbah 79:10. 22. Ha'amek Davar 33:20. 23. Bereshit Kabbah 76:2. 24. Ibid., 55:8. 25. Ibid., 76:8. 26. Compare Genesis 3:15: "you shall strike at their heel." See Rashi. 27. Bereshit Rabbah 63:13. 28. Ibid., 76:7. 29. This issue of sincerity, when Esau embraces Jacob, acquires a strange
significance among the commentators, evidently for historical reasons. See
Rashi, 33:4; Sifrei, Be-ha'alotkha, 69. 30. In a striking passage, Terry Eagleton puts the point in post-
structuralist terms:
Since the meaning of a sign is a matter of what the sign is not, its
meaning is always in some sense absent from it too. Meaning,
if you like, is scattered or dispersed along the whole chain
of signifiers: it cannot be easily nailed down, it is never fully
present in any one sign alone, but is rather a kind of constant
flickering of presence and absence together. . . . There is also
another sense in which we can never quite close our fists over
meaning, which arises from the fact that language is a  
temporal process. When I read a sentence, the meaning of it is
always somehow suspended, something deferred or still to
come. . . . There is always more meaning where that came
from. {Literary Theory [University of Minnesota Press: 1983], 128)
This idea of the constant modification of meaning in a text is a characteristic
"Jacob approach" to reading: "There is always more meaning where that
came from." 31. See p. 89-93 for a discussion of this theme, in connection with the
Binding of Isaac. God delays giving information to the righteous—in order to
generate lave for the commandment. Mystery, the unspoken edge of words,
is the source of interpretation and self-knowledge.

Notes
409 32. There is an extraordinary midrash (Bereshit Rabbab 80:6) that focuses
on three words signifying Shekhem's love (davek, hashek, hafetz) as the  
paradigms for the relation between God and Israel. Savage and lawless as She-
khenVs act is, the feelings become a kind of pure ore, something raw and
undistilled, which provides a glossary, as it were, for the texts of spiritual
passion. 33. "I have seen a divine being face to face" (32:31) suggests naked
confrontation with a powerful force in human guise. 34. See Trilling, Sincerity and Authenticity, 131-32, where he describes
the violence in modernist art as necessary "to startle ... to retrieve the
human spirit from its acquiescence in non-being." 35. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 37. 36. Ha'amek Davar 32:32. 37. See Ramban, who traces a fascinating etymological chain, through
the Targum: wrestling comes to evoke seduction, strategy, and clarification. 38. Bereshit Rabbah 78:3. 39. Harold Bloom uses this expression to translate the word berakha
("blessing"): an apt translation, since the word everywhere suggests "more-
ness," increase, as kelala ("curse") suggests diminution. See Ibn Ezra, 49:7. 40. See Ha'amek Davar 35:10. 41. Quoted in Harold Bloom, A Map of Misreading (Oxford University
Press: 1975), 163. 42. Ibid., 19. 43. See Ramban, 31:42. The "Fear of Isaac" is explicitly traced to the
Akedah experience. 44. Bloom, Map of Misreading, 38. 45. Ramban, 46:1. 46. Bloom, Map of Misreading, 69-70. 47. In his prayer before meeting Esau's army, Jacob does speak of "God of
my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac" but, as Rashi implies, he is
effectively quoting God's previous promise to him, in the dream at Beth El.
He himself is "afraid" (Rashi, 31:42) to speak of his father and his relation to
God in any terms other than that of "fear" in his father's lifetime. 48. John Milton, Paradise Lost, quoted in Bloom, Map of Misreading, 63. 49. See Meshekh Hokhmah 35:1:" 'Arise, go to Beth El and remain there;
and build an altar there to the God [El] who appeared to you.' There he built
an altar ... for it was there that God [Elohim] had revealed Himself to
him" (35:1,7). The name El refers to the God of love, while the name Elohim
refers to the God of Justice, or Dread. Jacob acquires the personal, active
vision of El, on the basis of a revelation of Elohim, in which he is not active
(God imposes the knowledge of dread on man, while man works actively to
see God as the God of love). In terms of our reading, Jacob's passive relation

410
Va-Yeshev
to Elohim is a function of his overinfluence by his father and his father's
vision of reality. 50. At crucial points of his life, Jacob refers to his sense of ra, of evil
besetting his consciousness. See 44:29, 34; 47:9; 48:16. 51. See Ramban, 32:13: "All these references to tov ["goodness"] are
derived from God's promise—'I shall be with you.'" 52. SefatEmet, 5649.
5 3. This verse figures importantly in midrashic and hasidic reflections on
this Parsha: see, e.g., Sefat Emet 5652, 5653. 54. See the first chapter of the present volume for a discussion of this idea. 55. The verse is quoted several times in the Talmud, as proof that "Adam
was created with two faces," facing front and back (e.g., B. Enivin 18b; see
Rashi). Sexual differentiation results from the splitting apart of this original
androgynous being.

lists Joseph's "plots," and concludes, "I swear . . . that if I pull my sword out
of its sheath, I shall fill the whole of Egypt with corpses." Ramban softens the
unequivocal anger of the midrashic reading—which does not seem to emerge
clearly from the biblical text—and suggests that Judah's accusation against
the ruler is only implicit, "hinted in his words." 26. See Elaine Scarry, The Body in Pain (Oxford University Press: 1987),
for a study of mute pain as the aim of the torturer, who hopes to deprive his
victim of language and of a connection with human institutions. This is what
Scarry calls the "unmaking of the world." 27. Gur Arye, 42:28. 28. See Rashbam, 37:28, who suggests that while the brothers were

"nakedness of the land," as "the sight of something that should remain

violates what Joseph is trying to hide from himself: his memory of their

work of memory: Joseph sends word reminding his father of the last Torah
issue they had studied together, before his kidnapping— the laws of egla arufa,
the heifer whose neck is broken, in token of the self-exoneration of society
when a corpse is found, unaccounted for. The heifer becomes a powerful
poetic metaphor, recollecting motifs from the past—brokenness, murder, the
extent of responsibility, the shared culture of father and son. On this reading,
Jacob comes to life under the impact of a potent poetic image and of the
demands of interpretation that it makes on him. 56. Mann, Joseph and His Brothers, 1124. 57. Ibid., 1127-28. 58. Ibid., 1133. 59. Ibid., 1136. 60. Ibid., 1130. 61. Midrash Ha-Gadol 45:26.

as "having other thoughts" — for example, on Genesis 6:6. Thus, both  
"comfort" and "regret" are covered by this single concept of a change in cognitive
gestalt.
3 5. There are midrashic sources that claim that Jacob does not believe his
sons' story. See Rashi Ha-Sbalem on 3 7, note 80. But Rashi clearly reads Jacob
as believing that Joseph is dead. 36. Beresbit Rabbah 91:1. 37. Wallace Stevens, "Notes towards a Supreme Fiction." 38. Ramban takes this view of the dynamic between Jacob and Rachel. 39. Isaiah 56:3. See Seforno, who also quotes this verse to explain
Rachel's sense of herself as "dead." 40. Beresbit Rabbah 70:17. 41. See 42:4, 38. See also B. Hulin 95b and J. Shabbat 6:5, where the
chain of disappearances is implicitly traced back to Rachel's death "on the
way." See Torab Temimah on 42:36. 42. In this reading, it is interesting that Rachel is considered the genuine
mother of all twelve tribes. In intention and desire, all Jacob's work for Laban
was for her. She is the wife and the mother who is "not there" in reality, but
who persists in imagination. 43. See Ramban, who translates "on the road there" in temporal, rather
than spatial terms: Rachel is buried at the point of contact with the future
passage of her children. 44. See Gur Arye, 48:7. See also the translation in Targum Jonathan of
Jeremiah 31:15: uKenessetyisrael is called Rachel." 45. Rashi comments on the masking effect of a beard (42:8). 46. See the translation oishama (21:22) in Targum Onkelos. 47. Samson Raphael Hirsch comments on the relation between bakha
("to weep") and bakay pakah ("to burst out"). Rashi quotes a midrashic
discussion about the genuineness of Esau's kiss. But tears are self-evidently
genuine and need no discussion. 48. George Steiner, Real Presences (University of Chicago Press: 1989), 96.

Notes
415 49. "The basis of man's life with man is twofold, and it is one—the wish of
every man to be confirmed as what he is, even as what he can become, by men;
and the innate capacity in man to confirm his fellow-men in this way." R. D.
Laing quotes this passage from Martin Buber as epigraph to his discussion
of "Confirmation and Disconfirmation," in Self and Others (Penguin: 1968), 98. He begins his discussion by emphasizing the partial, complex nature of
human confirmation: in Buber's words, it "is always 'to some extent or
other.'" 50. Paul Ricoeur, History and Truth, 322. 51. Neher, Exile of the Word, 236. 52. Ricoeur, History and Truth, 322. 53. See the chapter on Hayyei Sarah in this volume. 54.

   launching into the many-worded prayers of the Days of Atonement.

Va-Yiggash 13. See Midrash Ha-Gadol 44:18: "Va-yiggash means 'to examine/ " 14. Bereshit Rabbah 93:3. 15. Ibid., 93:8. 16. The midrashic tradition narrates that, in spite of Judah's fulfillment of
his guarantee to his father, he is in fact doomed to an eternity of restless
alienation: "All forty years that the Israelites were in the wilderness, Judah's
bones were rolling around in his coffin, because of the excommunication that
he accepted upon himself, as it is said, 'And I shall be a sinner to my father all
the days'" (44:32). (See Rashi, Deuteronomy 33:7.) He is ultimately released
from his fate; but the striking notion here is the absolute, unconditional
nature of his assumption of a fate of alienation. It is as though so complete a
commitment to the pain of others brands one apart from those others. 17. Judah puts the words, "You shall not see my face" into Joseph's
mouth—twice, in fact (43:3, 5)—although in the original version of Joseph's
decree, these words do not occur. This is Judah's pragmatic translation of the
meaning of Joseph's more "academic" statement: "Let your words be  
verified, so that you do not die" (42:20). 18. Lit., from my hand you may seek him. The play on hand imagery goes
back to the scene by the pit, where the direct "hands-on" involvement in
murder had led both Reuben and Judah to suggest less direct methods of
disposing of Joseph. Now, Judah recognizes an immediate physical  
responsibility, as a necessary feature of full moral agency. 19. See Torah Shelemah 43:13. In a passage in B. Baba Batra 173b, the
sages disagree over whether Judah's offer can be considered conceptually as
arevut— "standing surety." The long footnote discusses the implications of
this disagreement. 20. Tanbu?na, 1. 21. B. Sotah 10b. 22. Ibid. 23. Bereshit Rabbah 85:9. 24. Joseph is referred to as JeAoseph, including the letter heh from God's
name, in Psalms 81:6. 25. Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative, 11-12. 26. Likkutei Moharan 2:77. 27. See, however, Joel bin Nun's provocative suggestion that Jacob's
reported speech, "Alas, he was torn by a beast!" (44:28), does constitute news
for Joseph, who has assumed that Jacob's failure to search for him in Egypt
stems from neglect, or undue influence by the other brothers. In this reading,
Joseph's whole understanding of his father's attitude is changed by Judah's
speech; he now knows of the brothers' deception, and can no longer refrain
from revealing his identity (Megadimy 1, 20). 28. Sefat Emet, 5637.

Notes
417 29. See Jerome Bruner, Actual Minds, Possible Worlds (Harvard University
Press: 1986). In his chapter on "the transactional self," he cites a study in
which he found that "by their first birthday children are already adept at
following another's line of regard to search for an object that is engaging their
partner's attention" (60). Apparent egocentrism, he suggests, is really a
failure to grasp the structure of events (68). Using this model, one might say
that Judah's capacity to take Jacob's perspective depends on his growing
understanding of the human situation. 30. Levinas, Nine Talmudic Readings, 47; italics mine. 31. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, 102. 32. Ibid., 102-3. 33. B. Sotah 10b. 34.

to discriminate between the successes and failures in the work of Nietzsche
and Heidegger. 37. Beresbit Rabbab 8:5. The idea is reflected in the initial letters of the
quotation from Psalms: Emet Me-eretz Titzmab. These constitute the word
Emet: truth is woven from the separated letters, grounded in earth and
becoming. 38. See Sefat Emet, 5637. 39. Or Ha-Hayyim 45:26. 40. Or Ha-Hayyim quotes the sages' classic dictum about the taboo of
causing shame: "A person should rather throw himself into a fiery furnace
than shame his friend" (lit., cause his face to go pale). 41. See Beresbit Rabbab 93:9. 42. See, for instance, Rambam, Hilkbot Tesbuva 1:1, which includes
shame as one aspect of regret for past actions. 43. See Or Ha-Hayyim 45:4. 44. B. Menahot\*99b. 45. Sefat Emet, 5643. 46. See Targum Onkelos, Rashi, and Ramban. 47. Traditional readings of lo yakbol in many biblical contexts similarly
emphasize the force of an idea to "incapacitate," and, in effect, to mold the
moral personality. See, for instance, Deuteronomy 31:2, with Rashi's  
commentary. 48. Ramban distinguishes between two expressions for evil report (meivi
and motzi), on the basis of the truth or falsehood of the report. 49. Mann, Joseph and His Brothers, 1207. 50. Beresbit Rabbah 93:5.

Bereshit Rahhah 93:8. 65. Jonathan Miller, States of Mind (Pantheon: 1983), 40-41. 66. Bereshit Rahhah 94:3. The passage studied was the law of the broken-
necked heifer (eglah larufd), which deals with the problem of an unidentified
corpse and society's responsibility for the murder. The coded message works
on several levels at once, therefore: the theme of death and responsibility is
obviously appropriate, while the intimacy of the learning experience is
evoked as the surest proof of identity. Seeing the agalot is a trigger for a
complex response, in which aural, linguistic memory, and associations are
central. 67. Both Rashi and Ramban resolve the ambiguity of the pronouns in this
verse in this way; though Rashi consistently reads Joseph as the subject of
the whole sentence, while Ramban changes the subject of "he kissed,'' and
"he fell on his neck" to Jacob ("Who cries more, father for son, or son for
father?"). 68. See Or Ha-Hayyim 46:30. 69. See Or Ha-Hayyim 48:14. 70. This forms the beginning of the Haftara—the additional reading—
for the week.
VA-YEHI

1. See Rashi, 12:2, on the words, "And you shall be a blessing."
2. See Rashi, 25:11.

Notes
419 3. See B. Baba Metzia 87a. 4. See Yalkut Shim&ni, Lekh Lekha, 77; Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 52. 5. Midrasb Ha-Gadol 48:1. 6. See Rashbam, 29:25. 7. From here, according to Rashi (48:2), we learn the principle of
respectful behavior toward kings, even non-Jewish kings. Sifiei Hakhamim
emphasizes the paradox of this principle, in a situation where Joseph is, as it
were, "needy" of his father's blessing. 8. Bereshit Rabbah 96:3. 9. The most obvious reading would limit this "charge" to his burial
instructions (49:29-33). But midrashic readings broaden the scope of the
"charge" to cover the largest disposition of Jacob's spiritual estate. See Torah
Sbelemab, 49, note 403. 10. In his first anguish at the loss of Joseph, Jacob says: "I will go down
mourning to my son in She'ol [the grave, the underworld]" (37:35). This is
realized when he in fact "goes down" to Egypt to see his son again after
twenty-two years. 11. Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western
Literature, trans. Willard R. Trask (Princeton University Press: 1953), 12. 12. Bereshit Rabbah 96:1. The "closedness" of the text would represent
the seamless nature of the narrative: there is, of course, no narrative break
between verses 27 and 28. But the very meaning of the word Parsha has to do
with "separation," with spacing the text, as an aid toward interpreting it,
toward perceiving its structures, explicit and implicit. Sometimes, the break
seems forced; here, it is both forced and neutralized by "blocking." 13. The traditional understanding is that enslavement properly speaking
began only after the entire generation of Jacob's children had died. 14. Bereshit Rabbah 2:5. 15. Rashi, B. Ta'anit 24b; B. Megilla 22b. 16. This entreaty comes at the end of the amidah, the main prayer,
suggesting the move from the prayer mode to the intellectual mode of Torah
study, in which one needs "light of the eyes and of the heart/mind." See B.
Berakhot 16a. 17. Zobar, 1, 209b, quoted in Torah Sbelemab, 47 [50]. 18. See Isaiah 2:2; Ezekiel 38:16; Hosea 3:5; Micah 4:1; Daniel 10:14. 19. See Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending (Oxford University Press:
1967), a study of apocalyptic movements in history and of "endings" in
literature. 20. Moses' famous cry that he is "of uncircumcised lips" is translated by
Rashi to mean "blocked, impassible, sealed." The imagery of the foreskin can
be used to suggest an excess that prevents proper functioning, of the ears
(Jeremiah 6:10), the mind (Jeremiah 9:25), or even of fruit trees, banned

420
Va-Yebi
from harvesting for the first three years (Leviticus 19:23). This notion of
atum, of the impediment that weighs down and closes off, is related to our
theme of setima, the "block." 21. SefatEmet, Va-yehi, 5635. 22. Zohar 234b. 23. B. Pesahim 56a. 24. Douglas, Purity and Danger (Penguin: 1966). 25. Shakespeare, Sonnet 129. 26. See Rashi, 31:3:" 'Return to the land of your fathers'— and there I shall

impossible to rest my Presence upon you." 27. See Rashi, 45:27. 28. Sbemona Perakim, 7. 29. Harold Bloom, The Breaking of the Vessels (University of Chicago

realization that his transaction with Joseph is indicated in God's blessing at Luz—
his singling out of Joseph is rooted in God's words. 39. See the chapter on Va-yetze in this volume. 40. See Seforno, who suggests that what he sees is a blurred double
presence that he cannot identify. 41. Tanhuma, Va-yehi 6. 42. See Seforno, who relates the need for vision to the capacity for
blessing, in the context of Moses' death. 43. Several commentators—e.g., Mizrahi—read pilalti as a reference to a
rigorous thought process that would hold open positive possibilities. Jacob
accuses himself of a precipitate despair, a closing of the issue without further
internal debate. See also Targum Onkelos, who translates la sivarit. 44. Bereshit Rabbati, 227-28. 45. This text is often quoted in midrashic narratives, as a key to Jacob's
later life. See, e.g., Midrash Sekhel Tov, quoted in Torah Shelemah, 87 [189];
Bereshit Rabbab, 94:4. 46. See Or Ha-Hayyim, 48:8

Notes
421 47. See the chapter on Va-yishlah in this volume, and especially Tanbuma,
Va-yishlah, 8. 48. See Seforno, 48:8. 49. In most midrashic sources, it is Jacob, and not Joseph, who raises the
question of Rachel's burial. See, however, Targum Jonathan. 50. Hatam Sofer, Torat Mosbe, 47:1. 51. See Pesikta Rabbati, 3. 52. Gur Arye, 48:7. 53. Petihta, 24. 54. See Rashi, 37:35. Jacob's refusal is a subconscious intuition of
Joseph's survival. 55. See Rashi, 5:24: " 'Enoch walked with God; then he was no more [einenu]
for God took him': God removed him from the world before his time —
therefore the unusual expression about his death: he was not in the world to
fulfill his years." Einenu implies the removal from one world to some other
beyond man's perspective. 56. Robert Alter, The World of Biblical Literature (Basic Books: 1992), 22. 57. Ramban, 47:28. 58. Wallace Stevens, "Notes towards a Supreme Fiction." 59. Frank Kermode, "A Plain Sense of Things," in Midrash and Literature

3. Bereshit Rabbah\_ 5:3. Other sources are quoted in the commentary of
   Rabbenu Bahya on Leviticus 2:13. R. Hutner bases a discussion of the
   problematics of human free choice on this midrash (Pa&#x1e25;ad Yitz&#x1e25;ak, Rosh Hashanah 13:1).
4. Rosh Hashanah 31a: "The Psalm assigned to the second day of the
   week is Psalm 48, beginning, 'The Lord is great and much acclaimed/
   because on the second day He divided up His works and reigned over them."
5. J. Berakhot 1:5.
6. E.g., _Va-yikra Rabbah_ 14:9.

11. See 9:1-2, 6-7: "God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, 'Be fertile and increase, and fill the earth. The fear and dread of you shall be upon all the beasts of the earth and upon all the birds of the sky— everything with which the earth is astir [_tirmoss_] — and upon all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hand... Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; For in His image, did God make man. Be fertile, then, and increase; abound [_shirtzu_] on the earth and increase on it.'" The Rabbis (see Rashi, 9:6) define this as both a blessing and a commandment—the imperative of "apres le deluge." Even the word _sheretz_, with its specifically reptilian quality, is now incorporated into the imperative of human fertility. But here, too, the proliferation motif is set beside the motif of man's godlikeness.

43. The word _etzev_ occurs again in this early part of the biblical narrative, when Adam is punished: "Cursed be the ground because of you; by toil [_beitzavon_] shall you eat of it" (3:17). Rashi's comment stresses the unpredictable, willful nature of the earths response to man's curse. Man will be compelled by necessity to accept the "thorns and thistles", that the earth will offer him, after he has invested his best resources in it. This doom is reflected again later, when Noah is born, and there is new hope for "relief from our work and for the toil [_itz'von_] of our hands, out of the very soil which the Lord placed under a curse" (5:29). There, again, Rashi reiterates his theme of _itzavon_ as the frustration of the worker who sows wheat and reaps thorns and thistles. There, _itzavon_ is clearly associated with the "hands-on" involvement and risks that are confronted by creativity.

63. See _Bereshit Rabbah_ 17:5 for an account of man's "wisdom" in naming not only the animals but himself and God too.
64. The pivotal role of language is stressed by Rashi. God asks, redundantly, "Where are you?" only in order that Adam's version of his experience should not be inhibited by fear. God's desire is to "enter into words with him." Adam's response is inadequate to the occasion.
65. See the complex image of the cradle, in which man sleeps before Creation (_Bereshit Rabhah_ 2:3). The earth-nurse watches the cradle with apprehension (_toha u-boha_) the sleeping infant is contained, at peace, in this primary reality. But a secondary reality is already implicit: the sleeping child will awake to his full powers and destroy both himself and the world.
66. Another version of Rashi: On the sixth of Sivan, when Israel received the Torah, all the works of beginning were strengthened, and it was as if the world was created then.

86. Richard Rorty, _Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity_ (Cambridge University Press: 1989), 96.
87. The skeptic asks: "Does God see the nolad— that which is born...?" R. Yehoshua answers: "_Nolad_? Was there born to you a son?" His retort brings the "philosopher" down to earth, to the existential knowledge of fathers of mortal children. It is here, and not in the sublime certainties of metaphysical knowledge, that human understanding of God begins.

NOAH

1. There is a midrash that connects Noah's birth with Adam's death, and
   the end of the curse ("Cursed be the ground because of you . . . until you
   return to the ground" [3:17, 19]). (Psikta d'Rabbi Eliezer, in Torah Shelemah
   5:81).
2. Martin Buber, "The Tree of Knowledge," in On the Bible (Schocken:
   1982), 17.
3. Joseph is also described as "righteous," in Amos 2:6, and he, too, is
   described as feeding and sustaining his world.
4. See Ramban on 6:9.
5. See 6:5, 12-13, 17; 7:4.
6. Bereshit Rabbah 29:4
7. Compare Torah Shelemah 6:3 7 on the wordplay of gopher (the wood of
   the ark) and gophrit (sulfurous fire).
8. Tanhuma, Re'eh, 3.
9. See Rashi on Genesis 6:4: one third of the world was flooded in the
   time of Enosh.
10. See Rashi on 6:13.
11. See Ramban on 7:18: "The waters swelled. . . ."
12. Rashi's main source is Bereshit Rabbah 26:5.
13. Bereshit Rabbah 32:8.
14. See, for example, Tanhuma, Ba-midbar, 26.
15. The reference to the Tower of Babel generation is missing from the
    first edition of Rashi. There are, however, midrashic sources that suggest that
    at least some of the builders of the Tower were also destroyed. See Bereshit

Notes
387
Rabbah 38:16. This midrash plays on the words va-yafetz and va-yatzef—
"God scattered the builders" becomes "God swept them away." 16. Tanhuma, Tissa, 17. 17. Tanhuma, Va-yera, 8. 18. Tanhuma Yashan, Va-yera 10. 19. Bereshit Rabbah 52:8. 20. Va-yikra Rabbah 20:2. 21. Bereshit Rabbah 28:2. 22. Tanhuma, Noah, 11. 23. See, for example, Sefat Emet 5662, p.40. 24. Sifrei, Ha'azinu, 7.
2 5. Leviticus 20:17: "If a man marries his sister, the daughter of either his
father or his mother, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness,
it is a disgrace (hesed hu)" Rashi notes that in Aramaic hisuda is the term for
"disgrace"—which leaves us with the paradox oihesed as root for two contrary
ideas, "grace" and "disgrace." Ramban clearly finds this distasteful and
asserts (claiming the support of the Sages) that hesed posits the right,  
generous mode of relationship that the sinner is transgressing: instead of  
disinterested concern to marry off his sister, he demonstrates selfish lust.  
However, the radical possibilities in a paradoxical conception of hesed remain
intriguing. 26. Bereshit Rabbah 26:5. 27. See Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger (Penguin: 1966), 145, on the
dangers inherent in margins. 28. See Bachelard, Poetics of Space, 224: "How concrete everything  
becomes in the world of the spirit when an object, a mere door, can give images
of hesitation, temptation, desire, security, welcome and respect. If one were
to give an account of all the doors one has closed and opened, of all the doors
one would like to re-open, one would have to tell the story of one's entire
life." 29. Bereshit Rabbah 38:6. 30. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, 177-78. 31. Ibid., 165. 32. Ibid., 163. 33. Ibid., 158. 34. Ibid., 160. 35. Bachelard, Poetics of Space, 222. 36. See Rashi, 6:11. Targum Onkelos translates hamas (which Rashi, in
the wake of the midrash, translates zsgezel, "robbery") with the word hatufin,
"snatching," "rapaciousness." 37. See Bereshit Rabbah 27:3 for an analogy between the uses of the word
rabbah in both narratives and the fates of both worlds.

Noah 38. NahumM. Sarna, Understanding Genesis (Schocken: 1970), 52. 39. Rambam, Misbneb Torab, Hilkhot Melakbim 9:14. 40. The requirement oidinim—of instituting the structures of legality in
society— is one of the Seven Noachide Commandments. 41. See Beresbit Rabbab 70:12. 42. B. Sanhedrin 108b. See also Meshekb Hokbmah on 8:19. 43. Gordon S. Haight, George Eliot: A Biography (Clarendon Press: 1968), 464. 44. Tanhuma, Noah, 7. 45. See his commentary to Job 24:20. 46. Beresbit Rabbab 29:4. 47. Andre Neher, The Exile of the Word (Jewish Publication Society:
1981), 101. 48. Tanhuma, Noah, 5. See also Rashi, 6:14. 49. Sexually, too, he refuses to articulate his being: he has children late in
life (at 500 [5:32]) "because of the sin of his generation, which he saw. Only
when God told him to build the ark, he married and had children, a hundred
years before the Flood" (Ba-midbar Rabbab 14:12). 50. Beresbit Rabbab 30:9. 51. Ibid., 31:19. 52. Emmanuel Levinas, Totality and Infinity (Duquesne University Press:
1969), 110-15. 53. Ibid., 116. 54. "The righteous man knows the needs of his beast" has traditionally
been understood to refer to this relation to ones own needs, and their wise
management. 55. Tanhuma, Noah, 9. 56. See Ramban 6:19 57. Beresbit Rabbab 32:4. 58. Ibid, 32:8. 59. Ma'aseh Ha-shem 68:1. See also Targum Onkelos. 60. Bachelard, Poetics of Space, 224 61. See Tanbuma, Noah, 11, and our earlier discussion of this midrash.
This reading is based on the fact that Noah and his sons are listed separately
from their wives, in the original instructions to enter the ark (6:18; 7:7; 7:13),
but in pairs when they are told to leave the ark (8:16) —and, in the same
breath, God tells them of the fertility-imperative implicit in "coming out."
Noah, however, leaves in sexually segregated groups (8:18). 62. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 23. 63. Shakespeare, Hamlet, II, ii, 257. 64. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 23.

Notes
389 65. Baal Ha-Turim suggests that Og is a decoding of the words "Only
Noah," since they have the same numerical value (gematriya). This would
imply an intimate—perhaps dialectical—relation between the Noah who is
enclosed in the ark and the obsessional force of the giant king. 66. Bachelard, Poetics of Space\ 222-23. 67. See Rashi, 8:13, and B. Rosh Hashanah 12b. 68. Beresbit Rabbab 18:1. 69. Ibid., 18:3. 70. John Keats, "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer." 71. Beresbit Rabbab, 34:8 72. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, chap. 23. 73. "You have brought us into a net" (v.l 1); "We have come into fire and
water" (v. 12); "You have brought us out to the fresh air" (v. 12). Ibn Ezra reads
revaya as air, neither desiccating like fire, nor obliterating like water. Fire and
water are both dimensions of the Flood in midrashic literature. 74. See Radal on Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer chap. 23. 75. See Tanbuma, Tavo, 1. 76. Compare 6:5. 77. Rabbenu Bahya 8:21. 78.

LEKH LEKHA

   Arthur Mitchell (Modern Library: 1944), 323.
2. Beresbit Rabbab 38:21.
3. It is interesting to notice, however, that the first tin in the Torah (2:5)
   speaks of the absence of Man himself. ("When the Lord God made earth and
   heaven—when no shrub of the field was yet on earth and no grasses of the
   field had yet sprouted, because the Lord God had not sent rain upon the earth
   and there was no man — adam ayin — to till the soil. . . .") Without human
   consciousness of need and desire, without the experience of the "peculiar
   possibility of the negative," there can be no prayer, indeed no reality that is
   humanly appropriated. See Rashi's comment on this passage.
4. Ramban, 12:1.
5. Cf. ibid., 20:13.
6. Cf. Rashi's comment on me-artzkba (12:1) — " 'Go forth . . . from your

390
Lekh Lekha
land1: Move even further away from there" —his native land he has already
left with his father: the point now is to move on, away, with no specified
destination. 7. Tanhuma, Lekh Lekha, 3. 8. Y'lamdenu, quoted in Torah Shelemab 12:107. 9. See Rashi on this verse: " 'Therefore shall a man leave\* \ The Holy Spirit
makes this declaration, forbidding incest to all mankind." The incestuous
bond is primary not only chronologically, in the history of the child's  
development, but culturally and spiritually. A primal unity must be ruptured in
order that generation take place—the removal of the rib from Adam's body
becomes in Rashi's comment the paradigm for abenation-become-fruition. 10. Bereshit Rabbah 53:6. 11. Ibid., 39:16. The imagery of coinage suggests the capacity to "mint"
and reproduce, to beget in one's own image. Abraham and Sarah come to
represent a transformative mode that captures the human imagination. 12. Cf. the commentary of Etz Yosef: "Their two situations that are
reversed by the lovingkindness of God." 13. Tanbuma, Lekh Lekha, 3. 14. Rambam, Mishneh Torah y Hilkhot Teshuva 2:4. 15. B. RoshHashanah 16b. 16. My wordplay on krVah and akirah, with their identical but inverted
root letters, is not, I hope, entirely perverse. The state of  
alienation/barrenness (akirah) is one of ground torn away (kri'ah) — filaments of connection
with past and future rent apart. Discontinuity is the essential experience
Abraham comes to represent. 17. Midrash Ha-Gadol 12:1. 18. Cf. Rashi: " 'Lekh lekha': Go from your land — for your good, for your
benefit" (12:1). 19. See the comment of the Netziv on "And Abram went as God had told

them to the sciences.

In his comment on Proverbs 5:19, he cites an Arabic source for the
translation, "preoccupation"; and then adds the rabbinic reading, which
emphasizes "distraction." 43. Cf. Deuteronomy 28:34: "until you are driven mad by what your eyes
behold." And the comment of Haamek Davar. the madness comes not from
physical suffering but from the disruption of normal causal relationships. 44. W. B. Yeats, Easter, 1916. 45. Conversely, language always conspires to close off as it discloses
meaning: "There is also another sense in which we can never quite close our
fists over meaning, which arises from the fact that language is a temporal
process. When I read a sentence, the meaning of it is always somehow
suspended, something deferred or still to come" (Terry Eagleton, Literary
Theory [University of Minnesota Press: 1983], 128). Deferral, writes George
Steiner (Real Presences [University of Chicago Press: 1989], 122) is "that
postponement of settled signification, that keeping in flickering motion
which adjourns the illusion, the sterile fixity of meaning."
Note that Rashi has changed the text of his source in Bereshit Rabbah,
which speaks of a reward for each step, an image obviously more appropriate,
as Abraham sets out on a journey, each step of which is shrouded in doubt.
Perhaps Rashi is thinking primarily of his supporting prooftexts, where
delayed language is an appropriate expression of indeterminacy. The third
example Rashi gives ("on one of the mountains") is his own addition to the
quotations in Bereshit Rabbah: for him, evidently, this theme is central to the
Abraham idea, and it is crucial to consider the three quotations as an organic
structure. 46. E.g., Sifrei Deuteronomy, 326: "When God punishes Israel, He, as it
were, regrets it." J. Nedarim, 9, 41b: "Is not regret of a vow like a novel
[unforeseen] circumstance?" Shemot Rabbah, 43:11: in Moses' prayer of

392
Lekb Lekba
intercession, "Turn back from Your burning anger and think better of the
evil decreed against Your people" (Exodus 32:12), the word for "think
better" (hinnahem) is translated, "Let tehiya exist for You." 47. Cf. B. Shavuot 17a: "When he did not stand still, he walked  
constantly." B. Berakhot 5a: "The pious spend an hour in silent contemplation
before prayer." B. Berakhot 32b: "They would contemplate an hour, pray an
hour, and again contemplate an hour."
Compare George Steiner's discussion of Derrida's "famous neologism,
la difference, [which] is crucial to the deconstnictionist and post-structuralist
counter-theology of absence." Particularly in the sense of "deferral" — "that
postponement of settled signification, that keeping in flickering motion
which adjourns the illusion, the sterile fixity of definition" (Real Presences,
P 122). 48. Cf. B. Yevamot 36b: "A human birth that survived thirty days is not
considered an abortion." 49. The expression is borrowed from John Keats, "On First Looking into
Chapman's Homer" Compare B. Hulin 75b: "Reish Lakish gazed at him
(when R. Yohanan gave his opinion) and was silent." 50. Note that the double cry, "Abraham! Abraham!" as God's angel
reveals himself after the Akedah (22:11) is described by Rashi as "an  
expression of love [biba]" Here, God reciprocates Abraham's love, after the  
suspension in space and time is resolved. 51. Cf. R. D. Laing's clinical description of akarut as peril and  
opportunity:
Something happens that is incompatible with [this] pivotal
identity, perhaps hidden, that determines his whole system of
meaning. A linch-pin is removed that had been holding a whole
world together, The whole meaning of reality crumbles. It
'fakesthe groundfrom under his feet" [my italics]. Participation in
the world, such terms as "contact with" and "sense of reality"
are empty sounds. A desperate crisis indeed. Either one  
restructures one's whole "real" view of others and the world and
redefines one's "real" self; or one annuls the chasm between
what is the case and what one knows to be the case, by taking
one's stand on what one knows. There is nothing more real and
indubitable than pure phantasy; nothing more obvious;  
nothing less necessary and more easy to prove. (Self and Others
[Penguin: 1961], 93) 52. The repeated second-person singular possessive suffix in the lekb
lekba summons—"Go forth from your land, your birthplace, your father's
house" brings an almost hypnotic focus to bear on self. This suggests a
fascination in abandonment.

Notes
393 53. Compare the use Rashi makes of the words terufznA meshugga in his
account of the drowning of the Egyptians. Their self-infatuation gives them a
fatal buoyancy that will not allow them the mercy of a quick death. 54. Frank Kermode, The Genesis of Secrecy (Harvard University Press:
1979), 145. 55. The text discussed in the Talmud is "Today you have become the
people of the Lord" (Deuteronomy 27:9). "Today" suggests a "double
exposure" effect: the day of Moses' speaking, or indeed the day of the reader's
reading, becomes elided with the day of the Giving of the Torah on Sinai. 56. Cf. the comment of Ha'amek Davar on Exodus 19:19. 57. Tanhuma, Miketz, 2. 58. See Rashi on Exodus 6:9, citing B. Sanhedrin Ilia. 59. Bereshit Kabbah, 44:6. 60. Ibid., 57:2. Cf. Rashi on 22:20. The midrash is apparently playing on
the similarity between ahar ha-devarim ha-ekh ("after these things") and
hirburim. 61. Cf. Isaiah 59:13. 62. B. Niddah 16b. 63. It is interesting to notice the "timing" of Abraham's hirburim, in the
midrashic sources—e.g. Bereshit Rabbah 56:12: "Abraham began to wonder:
All these events are bewildering—yesterday You told me, 'In Isaac, seed shall
be named for you'; then You said, 'Please take your son'; and now You tell me,
'Do not stretch out your hand against the boy\* —I am full of wonder!" It is
only after a certain crisis of commitment is past that he opens himself to the
complex contradictions (literally, the counterdictions—mutually exclusive
speech acts) of his situation: characteristically, after these things. Compare
also the version of this midrash in J. Ta'anit 2:4: "Master of the universe, it is
fully revealed to You that at the time that You told me to offer up my son, / had
what to answer You?' The timing of Abraham's musings on contradiction is of
the essence here. "I had a response" indicates the thought that is immediately
submerged in the movement of love for God. Only when he has acted out that
commitment do the full implications of contradiction surge up in his mind.
This is the time for meaning-making. 64. J. Huizinga, Homo Ludens (Routledge and Kegan Paul: 1949), 13.
Huizinga defines play as "a free activity standing quite consciously outside
'ordinary' life as being 'not serious,' but at the same time absorbing the player
intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and
no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of
time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner." 65. Midrash Ha-Gadol, Genesis 12:1 66. Chaos, the formless emptiness of the uncreated world, is described in
Genesis as tohu va-vohu: the cosmological dimension of a full emptiness out

of which everything is engendered holds both horror and fascination for
human beings, whose essential need is for structure. (See Rashi's comment
on these words, Genesis 1:2.) Tebiya is tobu on the existential plane. 67. Tanbuma, Lekh Lekha, 2. 68. In Pahad Yitzhak (Pesah, 17:5), Rav Yitzhak Hutner explores the
theme of the necessity of the question. Often, he suggests, the answer is in
greater need of a good question than the question is in need of an answer.
Only when imperfection, need, tension are authentically experienced, (the
"anomaly" of which Kuhn writes) does man progress toward wholeness.
Resolution without tension is a joyless triumph. In these terms, Rav Hutner
discusses the indeterminacy of Abraham's journey: knowledge comes to him
"as the answer to a real question, not as an arbitrary answer" — as response to
an existence fabricated out of questions. "When God caused me to wander
away from my father's house" (Genesis 20:13) — "God led me to know Him
precisely through the experiences of felt not-knowing." 69. Kuhn, Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 87. 70. Sefat Emet 5648.
VA-YERA

1. "Take please": Na is an expression of request. God said to Abraham,
   "Please stand firm for Me in this test, so that people should not say, The first
   tests had no substance to them."
2. B. Sanhedrin 89b.
3. See Genesis 12:7-8 and 13:4.
4. Isaiah 41:8.
5. Rashi's comment is based on Tanbuma, Shelah, 14. It is interesting to
   notice that in the original midrash, the prooftext is, "Go, eat your bread in
   gladness ... for your action was long ago approved by God" (Ecclesiastes
   9:7). Abraham is vindicated and the effect is—bathetically? — that he can
   return to his se'udah, to the feasting that generated the doubts that made the
   test necessary in the first place.

Notes
395 15. Cf. the discussion in Bereshit Rabbah 48:16, as to whether the angels
really ate, or only appeared to eat. 16. Cf. Ruth 3:7: "Boaz ate and drank, and in a cheerful mood went to lie
down"; and the comment in Ruth Rabbah: " Hn a cheerful mood" (lit., his heart
was good) — he made a blessing over his food. Or, he ate a variety of sweets that
train the tongue for Torah." The implication is that Boaz is fully nurtured by
the world, and can make use of reality: by an act of alchemy, food is
metabolized to creative play in Torah. (See Likutei Moharan 1, 19:7.) 17. Cf. Harvey Cox, in Feast of Fools (Harper and Row: 1969), writes of the
prodigality and fantasy, the "calculated excess" implied in feasting and living
it up, dressing up. Cf. Abraham's teaching to Sarah: "This is no time for
austerity [modesty] — uncover your breasts and nurse all the princes of the
world!" (Bereshit Rabbah 53:13). 18. B. Sotah 10b. Cf. Rashi on this verse. 19. See Rashi on this verse: "hotel, a place where the stranger is lodged,

Sanhedrin 89b—se 'udah—is rooted in the invitation that Abraham extends to
the angels — "SaWh libkhem" — "you may refresh yourselves" —lit., support
your heart (18:5). This is the primary concept of eating; as Rashi points out,
the expression "heart support" is used throughout Scriptures for "food."
What Abraham is offering is an experience in which dependency is overcome
and the hazards of growth and separation are mediated. 25. See Rashi on 7:23. 26. Tanhuma, Lekh Lekha, 12. 27. R. Hutner, Pahad Yitzhak, Pesah, 18:5. 28. Cf. B. Yevamot 79a, where this source is chosen as the prooftext for

"potential space" —to R. Daniel Epstein. 47. Cf. Matthew Arnold, Culture and Anarchy, 48. Rashi suggests (on v.31) that the historical reference here is to the two
thousand years before Abraham's time: the fully human phase of "sons of
men" begins with Abraham, whose work it is to grow "sons of men" out of
the culture of a merely potential universe. 49. "The Hermeneutic Quest in Robinson Crusoe" in Midrash and

of such hesed is mere unintelligibility. The world continues as though there
were no justice, no judge. To Jonah, this is an outrage against emet, the Truth,
that is so conspicuously missing from his list of divine attributes (4:2).
Without Truth, hesed seems to him a deplorable, even self-destructive foible
of God. 45. Cf. Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Teshuva, chap. 7, in which Rambam
traces the complexities of sin, penitence, reward, and punishment. Rambam
reiterates constantly that the transcendent truth is in no way derivable from
experience. On the contrary, "Do not say. . . . ," "Let the penitent not
imagine that. . . . ," "A person should always see himself as though. . . ." 46. See Rashi, 24:14. 47. Bereshit Rabbah 60:2. 48. See, for instance, the injunction, "Azov ta yazov into—You shall indeed
come to the aid of your enemy, whose donkey has collapsed under its burden"
(Exodus 23:5). The ambiguities and rhetorical questions involved in this text
are the subject of much rabbinic commentary. For an unequivocal example of
azav as "reinforcement," see Nehemiah 3:8. 49. Neher, Exile of the Word, 285-86. 50. This is not a moment of joy; for doubt and suspense make awkward
bedfellows with joy. The legacy of Sarah's death is her last cry. According to
the Midrash Ha-Gadol (2 3:2), Kiryat Arba, the place of her death ("the city of
four"), is called so because of her four death cries—expressing sadness on
hearing her son's fate; wailing for her son; the bitterness of her death; and
mourning for the fact that there is no perfect joy. These carefully  
differentiated modes culminate in the "reversibility of joy," as the Midrash OrAfela
has it. Realization of the volatile nature of experience and consciousness is not
easily neutralized. 51. Bereshit Rabbah 60:14. 52. See the commentary of Ha'amek Davar on this meeting.

Toledot 3. Ibid., 67:4. 4. Ramban focuses on the unexpectedness of Isaac's reply. He  
mobilizes this to intensify the outrage of Isaac's question, which now covers the
involuntary nature of the blessing: he trembles all the more violently for
knowing that the blessing is a reality, in spite of his intention and present
feeling. 5. Beresbit Rabbah 67:3. 6. Compare "And Jacob called his sons" (49:1), which introduces his
deathbed blessings. 7. Beresbit Rabbah 67:10. 8. Ibid., 78:14. 9. Rashi is reponding here to the past tense form of berakbtani. He
translates literally, "till you admit my having been blessed, in the past." 10. Sarna, Understanding Genesis; 188. 11. Ramban, 27:12 12. B. Sanhedrin 92a. 13. Midrash Misblei 10:17. 14.

The striking feature of this version of the midrash is that Abraham
cannot come to his own just assessment of the facts, even after God has
changed Isaac's appearance. It is because of the consensus of opinion of
others, who can see both father and son, that Abraham's suspicions are
allayed. The visual factor, the criterion of perspective and opinion, remains
central, even after the miracle. 20. Lionel Trilling discusses this concept, and its relation to the  
"sentiments of art," in Sincerity and Authenticity (Harvard University Press: 1971),

the savage who "lives within himself*' with the sociable man who "knows
how to live only in the opinion of others, and it is, so to speak, from their
judgment alone that he draws the sentiment of his own being** (quoted in
Trilling, 62). 70. Shakespeare, Hamlet, I, ii, 76. 71. Rashi comments on "I ate of it all**: "All delicacies that I sought to
taste, I tasted in his food.'\* Isaac experiences the triumph of the desiring
imagination, fusing the sensual with the spiritual—a similar notion to the
classic midrashic descriptions of the taste of the manna, and the experience of
receiving the Torah at Mount Sinai. 72. Compare Abarbanel's reading of lo hikiro. Unlike most  
commentators, he translates, "he did not identify him,** rather than "he did not
recognize him." 73. In the Beresbit Rabbah source, Jacob describes his anokhi differently:
"/ am destined to receive the Ten Commandments**— a word-play on the
opening statement of the Ten Commandments: "lam the Lord your God.\*'
In this reading, Jacob's identity will find full standing only in the anokhi
encounter of Sinai, where man will achieve an unprecedented strength to
"stand** in the presence of God. [See essay on "Bereshit,*' especially pp. 20-
36.] See also the comment of Ibn Ezra on Jacob's "disinformation:" he rejects

VA-YISHLAH

1. Midrashic tradition associates this death with the death of Rebecca
   herself— a covert way of referring to a death too painful to describe. (/Illon is
   "other" in Greek: "another weeping" encodes a reference to an undescribed
   death.) See Rashi and Ramban, 35:8.
2. Compare the disagreement between Rashi and Ramban on whether
   the following clause—"the Lord shall be my God"—belongs to the condition
   or the promise part of the vow.
3. Compare the terms of Rebecca's directions to him: "Stay [ve-
   yashavta] with him" (27:44). "He stayed with him a month's time" (29:14). In
   retrospect, what had at the time been experienced as a real settling and
   cooperation dwindles into an episode, radically unimportant. There may, of
   course, be a tactical element in Jacob's presentation of himself to his brother
   as unchanged.
4. See Rashi: Jacob is afraid to repeat God's words, crediting Isaac with a
   relationship to God, even while he is still alive and his "godliness" is still in
   question.
5. B. Megillah 17a.
6. The moral question about Dinah's responsibility for her own fate
   does not arise in these midrashic treatments. To all intents and purposes,
   Dinah becomes a dream figure in Jacob's consciousness—as, indeed, do all
   the characters in his narrative—as the midrash traces the patterns, shadowy
   and often repressed, of his experience.
7. See Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 35: "Jacob fell on his face on the ground,
   in front of the Stone of Foundation, and prayed to God: Master of all worlds,
   if you bring me back to this place in wholeness, I will sacrifice before You
   offerings of thanks and burnt offerings—as it is said, 'And Jacob made a
   vow.'" Targum Jonathan also indicates that the core meaning of a vow is
   sacrifice.

14. Before this, only God has made promises; and—as Rashi comments
    in a classic passage (Exodus 6:3-8)—His promises have made human beings
    peculiarly aware of the "dangerous" quality of words unfulfilled.
15. See Rashi Ha-Shalem on 3 5:1, for a list of sources using either of these
    formulations.

408
Va-Yishlah 16. Maharal describes the connection differently: Jacob's tragic flaw,
expressed covertly when he withholds Dinah from Esau, becomes visible,
cries out to high heaven, after he has delayed on his return home. His delay
acts as a catalyst: the ledgers fall open for rigorous inspection (Gur Arye,
32:22). 17. Bereshit Kabbah 76:9. 18. Saint Augustine, The City of God (Hafner Library: 1948), 78-81. 19. Bereshit Kabbah 80:3. 20. B. Megillah 18a. 21. Bereshit Kabbah 79:10. 22. Ha'amek Davar 33:20. 23. Bereshit Kabbah 76:2. 24. Ibid., 55:8. 25. Ibid., 76:8. 26. Compare Genesis 3:15: "you shall strike at their heel." See Rashi. 27. Bereshit Rabbah 63:13. 28. Ibid., 76:7. 29. This issue of sincerity, when Esau embraces Jacob, acquires a strange
significance among the commentators, evidently for historical reasons. See
Rashi, 33:4; Sifrei, Be-ha'alotkha, 69. 30. In a striking passage, Terry Eagleton puts the point in post-
structuralist terms:
Since the meaning of a sign is a matter of what the sign is not, its
meaning is always in some sense absent from it too. Meaning,
if you like, is scattered or dispersed along the whole chain
of signifiers: it cannot be easily nailed down, it is never fully
present in any one sign alone, but is rather a kind of constant
flickering of presence and absence together. . . . There is also
another sense in which we can never quite close our fists over
meaning, which arises from the fact that language is a  
temporal process. When I read a sentence, the meaning of it is
always somehow suspended, something deferred or still to
come. . . . There is always more meaning where that came
from. {Literary Theory [University of Minnesota Press: 1983], 128)
This idea of the constant modification of meaning in a text is a characteristic
"Jacob approach" to reading: "There is always more meaning where that
came from." 31. See p. 89-93 for a discussion of this theme, in connection with the
Binding of Isaac. God delays giving information to the righteous—in order to
generate lave for the commandment. Mystery, the unspoken edge of words,
is the source of interpretation and self-knowledge.

Notes
409 32. There is an extraordinary midrash (Bereshit Rabbab 80:6) that focuses
on three words signifying Shekhem's love (davek, hashek, hafetz) as the  
paradigms for the relation between God and Israel. Savage and lawless as She-
khenVs act is, the feelings become a kind of pure ore, something raw and
undistilled, which provides a glossary, as it were, for the texts of spiritual
passion. 33. "I have seen a divine being face to face" (32:31) suggests naked
confrontation with a powerful force in human guise. 34. See Trilling, Sincerity and Authenticity, 131-32, where he describes
the violence in modernist art as necessary "to startle ... to retrieve the
human spirit from its acquiescence in non-being." 35. Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 37. 36. Ha'amek Davar 32:32. 37. See Ramban, who traces a fascinating etymological chain, through
the Targum: wrestling comes to evoke seduction, strategy, and clarification. 38. Bereshit Rabbah 78:3. 39. Harold Bloom uses this expression to translate the word berakha
("blessing"): an apt translation, since the word everywhere suggests "more-
ness," increase, as kelala ("curse") suggests diminution. See Ibn Ezra, 49:7. 40. See Ha'amek Davar 35:10. 41. Quoted in Harold Bloom, A Map of Misreading (Oxford University
Press: 1975), 163. 42. Ibid., 19. 43. See Ramban, 31:42. The "Fear of Isaac" is explicitly traced to the
Akedah experience. 44. Bloom, Map of Misreading, 38. 45. Ramban, 46:1. 46. Bloom, Map of Misreading, 69-70. 47. In his prayer before meeting Esau's army, Jacob does speak of "God of
my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac" but, as Rashi implies, he is
effectively quoting God's previous promise to him, in the dream at Beth El.
He himself is "afraid" (Rashi, 31:42) to speak of his father and his relation to
God in any terms other than that of "fear" in his father's lifetime. 48. John Milton, Paradise Lost, quoted in Bloom, Map of Misreading, 63. 49. See Meshekh Hokhmah 35:1:" 'Arise, go to Beth El and remain there;
and build an altar there to the God [El] who appeared to you.' There he built
an altar ... for it was there that God [Elohim] had revealed Himself to
him" (35:1,7). The name El refers to the God of love, while the name Elohim
refers to the God of Justice, or Dread. Jacob acquires the personal, active
vision of El, on the basis of a revelation of Elohim, in which he is not active
(God imposes the knowledge of dread on man, while man works actively to
see God as the God of love). In terms of our reading, Jacob's passive relation

410
Va-Yeshev
to Elohim is a function of his overinfluence by his father and his father's
vision of reality. 50. At crucial points of his life, Jacob refers to his sense of ra, of evil
besetting his consciousness. See 44:29, 34; 47:9; 48:16. 51. See Ramban, 32:13: "All these references to tov ["goodness"] are
derived from God's promise—'I shall be with you.'" 52. SefatEmet, 5649.
5 3. This verse figures importantly in midrashic and hasidic reflections on
this Parsha: see, e.g., Sefat Emet 5652, 5653. 54. See the first chapter of the present volume for a discussion of this idea. 55. The verse is quoted several times in the Talmud, as proof that "Adam
was created with two faces," facing front and back (e.g., B. Enivin 18b; see
Rashi). Sexual differentiation results from the splitting apart of this original
androgynous being.

lists Joseph's "plots," and concludes, "I swear . . . that if I pull my sword out
of its sheath, I shall fill the whole of Egypt with corpses." Ramban softens the
unequivocal anger of the midrashic reading—which does not seem to emerge
clearly from the biblical text—and suggests that Judah's accusation against
the ruler is only implicit, "hinted in his words." 26. See Elaine Scarry, The Body in Pain (Oxford University Press: 1987),
for a study of mute pain as the aim of the torturer, who hopes to deprive his
victim of language and of a connection with human institutions. This is what
Scarry calls the "unmaking of the world." 27. Gur Arye, 42:28. 28. See Rashbam, 37:28, who suggests that while the brothers were

work of memory: Joseph sends word reminding his father of the last Torah
issue they had studied together, before his kidnapping— the laws of egla arufa,
the heifer whose neck is broken, in token of the self-exoneration of society
when a corpse is found, unaccounted for. The heifer becomes a powerful
poetic metaphor, recollecting motifs from the past—brokenness, murder, the
extent of responsibility, the shared culture of father and son. On this reading,
Jacob comes to life under the impact of a potent poetic image and of the
demands of interpretation that it makes on him. 56. Mann, Joseph and His Brothers, 1124. 57. Ibid., 1127-28. 58. Ibid., 1133. 59. Ibid., 1136. 60. Ibid., 1130. 61. Midrash Ha-Gadol 45:26.

as "having other thoughts" — for example, on Genesis 6:6. Thus, both  
"comfort" and "regret" are covered by this single concept of a change in cognitive
gestalt.
3 5. There are midrashic sources that claim that Jacob does not believe his
sons' story. See Rashi Ha-Sbalem on 3 7, note 80. But Rashi clearly reads Jacob
as believing that Joseph is dead. 36. Beresbit Rabbah 91:1. 37. Wallace Stevens, "Notes towards a Supreme Fiction." 38. Ramban takes this view of the dynamic between Jacob and Rachel. 39. Isaiah 56:3. See Seforno, who also quotes this verse to explain
Rachel's sense of herself as "dead." 40. Beresbit Rabbah 70:17. 41. See 42:4, 38. See also B. Hulin 95b and J. Shabbat 6:5, where the
chain of disappearances is implicitly traced back to Rachel's death "on the
way." See Torab Temimah on 42:36. 42. In this reading, it is interesting that Rachel is considered the genuine
mother of all twelve tribes. In intention and desire, all Jacob's work for Laban
was for her. She is the wife and the mother who is "not there" in reality, but
who persists in imagination. 43. See Ramban, who translates "on the road there" in temporal, rather
than spatial terms: Rachel is buried at the point of contact with the future
passage of her children. 44. See Gur Arye, 48:7. See also the translation in Targum Jonathan of
Jeremiah 31:15: uKenessetyisrael is called Rachel." 45. Rashi comments on the masking effect of a beard (42:8). 46. See the translation oishama (21:22) in Targum Onkelos. 47. Samson Raphael Hirsch comments on the relation between bakha
("to weep") and bakay pakah ("to burst out"). Rashi quotes a midrashic
discussion about the genuineness of Esau's kiss. But tears are self-evidently
genuine and need no discussion. 48. George Steiner, Real Presences (University of Chicago Press: 1989), 96.

Notes

every man to be confirmed as what he is, even as what he can become, by men;
and the innate capacity in man to confirm his fellow-men in this way." R. D.
Laing quotes this passage from Martin Buber as epigraph to his discussion
of "Confirmation and Disconfirmation," in Self and Others (Penguin: 1968), 98. He begins his discussion by emphasizing the partial, complex nature of
human confirmation: in Buber's words, it "is always 'to some extent or
other.'" 50. Paul Ricoeur, History and Truth, 322. 51. Neher, Exile of the Word, 236. 52. Ricoeur, History and Truth, 322. 53. See the chapter on Hayyei Sarah in this volume. 54.

Va-Yiggash 13. See Midrash Ha-Gadol 44:18: "Va-yiggash means 'to examine/ " 14. Bereshit Rabbah 93:3. 15. Ibid., 93:8. 16. The midrashic tradition narrates that, in spite of Judah's fulfillment of
his guarantee to his father, he is in fact doomed to an eternity of restless
alienation: "All forty years that the Israelites were in the wilderness, Judah's
bones were rolling around in his coffin, because of the excommunication that
he accepted upon himself, as it is said, 'And I shall be a sinner to my father all
the days'" (44:32). (See Rashi, Deuteronomy 33:7.) He is ultimately released
from his fate; but the striking notion here is the absolute, unconditional
nature of his assumption of a fate of alienation. It is as though so complete a
commitment to the pain of others brands one apart from those others. 17. Judah puts the words, "You shall not see my face" into Joseph's
mouth—twice, in fact (43:3, 5)—although in the original version of Joseph's
decree, these words do not occur. This is Judah's pragmatic translation of the
meaning of Joseph's more "academic" statement: "Let your words be  
verified, so that you do not die" (42:20). 18. Lit., from my hand you may seek him. The play on hand imagery goes
back to the scene by the pit, where the direct "hands-on" involvement in
murder had led both Reuben and Judah to suggest less direct methods of
disposing of Joseph. Now, Judah recognizes an immediate physical  
responsibility, as a necessary feature of full moral agency. 19. See Torah Shelemah 43:13. In a passage in B. Baba Batra 173b, the
sages disagree over whether Judah's offer can be considered conceptually as
arevut— "standing surety." The long footnote discusses the implications of
this disagreement. 20. Tanbu?na, 1. 21. B. Sotah 10b. 22. Ibid. 23. Bereshit Rabbah 85:9. 24. Joseph is referred to as JeAoseph, including the letter heh from God's
name, in Psalms 81:6. 25. Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative, 11-12. 26. Likkutei Moharan 2:77. 27. See, however, Joel bin Nun's provocative suggestion that Jacob's
reported speech, "Alas, he was torn by a beast!" (44:28), does constitute news
for Joseph, who has assumed that Jacob's failure to search for him in Egypt
stems from neglect, or undue influence by the other brothers. In this reading,
Joseph's whole understanding of his father's attitude is changed by Judah's
speech; he now knows of the brothers' deception, and can no longer refrain
from revealing his identity (Megadimy 1, 20). 28. Sefat Emet, 5637.

Notes
417 29. See Jerome Bruner, Actual Minds, Possible Worlds (Harvard University
Press: 1986). In his chapter on "the transactional self," he cites a study in
which he found that "by their first birthday children are already adept at
following another's line of regard to search for an object that is engaging their
partner's attention" (60). Apparent egocentrism, he suggests, is really a
failure to grasp the structure of events (68). Using this model, one might say
that Judah's capacity to take Jacob's perspective depends on his growing
understanding of the human situation. 30. Levinas, Nine Talmudic Readings, 47; italics mine. 31. Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, 102. 32. Ibid., 102-3. 33. B. Sotah 10b. 34.

to discriminate between the successes and failures in the work of Nietzsche
and Heidegger. 37. Beresbit Rabbab 8:5. The idea is reflected in the initial letters of the
quotation from Psalms: Emet Me-eretz Titzmab. These constitute the word
Emet: truth is woven from the separated letters, grounded in earth and
becoming. 38. See Sefat Emet, 5637. 39. Or Ha-Hayyim 45:26. 40. Or Ha-Hayyim quotes the sages' classic dictum about the taboo of
causing shame: "A person should rather throw himself into a fiery furnace
than shame his friend" (lit., cause his face to go pale). 41. See Beresbit Rabbab 93:9. 42. See, for instance, Rambam, Hilkbot Tesbuva 1:1, which includes
shame as one aspect of regret for past actions. 43. See Or Ha-Hayyim 45:4. 44. B. Menahot\*99b. 45. Sefat Emet, 5643. 46. See Targum Onkelos, Rashi, and Ramban. 47. Traditional readings of lo yakbol in many biblical contexts similarly
emphasize the force of an idea to "incapacitate," and, in effect, to mold the
moral personality. See, for instance, Deuteronomy 31:2, with Rashi's  
commentary. 48. Ramban distinguishes between two expressions for evil report (meivi
and motzi), on the basis of the truth or falsehood of the report. 49. Mann, Joseph and His Brothers, 1207. 50. Beresbit Rabbah 93:5.

Bereshit Rahhah 93:8. 65. Jonathan Miller, States of Mind (Pantheon: 1983), 40-41. 66. Bereshit Rahhah 94:3. The passage studied was the law of the broken-
necked heifer (eglah larufd), which deals with the problem of an unidentified
corpse and society's responsibility for the murder. The coded message works
on several levels at once, therefore: the theme of death and responsibility is
obviously appropriate, while the intimacy of the learning experience is
evoked as the surest proof of identity. Seeing the agalot is a trigger for a
complex response, in which aural, linguistic memory, and associations are
central. 67. Both Rashi and Ramban resolve the ambiguity of the pronouns in this
verse in this way; though Rashi consistently reads Joseph as the subject of
the whole sentence, while Ramban changes the subject of "he kissed,'' and
"he fell on his neck" to Jacob ("Who cries more, father for son, or son for
father?"). 68. See Or Ha-Hayyim 46:30. 69. See Or Ha-Hayyim 48:14. 70. This forms the beginning of the Haftara—the additional reading—

1. See Rashi, 12:2, on the words, "And you shall be a blessing."
2. See Rashi, 25:11.

Notes
419 3. See B. Baba Metzia 87a. 4. See Yalkut Shim&ni, Lekh Lekha, 77; Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer, 52. 5. Midrasb Ha-Gadol 48:1. 6. See Rashbam, 29:25. 7. From here, according to Rashi (48:2), we learn the principle of
respectful behavior toward kings, even non-Jewish kings. Sifiei Hakhamim
emphasizes the paradox of this principle, in a situation where Joseph is, as it
were, "needy" of his father's blessing. 8. Bereshit Rabbah 96:3. 9. The most obvious reading would limit this "charge" to his burial
instructions (49:29-33). But midrashic readings broaden the scope of the
"charge" to cover the largest disposition of Jacob's spiritual estate. See Torah
Sbelemab, 49, note 403. 10. In his first anguish at the loss of Joseph, Jacob says: "I will go down
mourning to my son in She'ol [the grave, the underworld]" (37:35). This is
realized when he in fact "goes down" to Egypt to see his son again after
twenty-two years. 11. Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western
Literature, trans. Willard R. Trask (Princeton University Press: 1953), 12. 12. Bereshit Rabbah 96:1. The "closedness" of the text would represent
the seamless nature of the narrative: there is, of course, no narrative break
between verses 27 and 28. But the very meaning of the word Parsha has to do
with "separation," with spacing the text, as an aid toward interpreting it,
toward perceiving its structures, explicit and implicit. Sometimes, the break
seems forced; here, it is both forced and neutralized by "blocking." 13. The traditional understanding is that enslavement properly speaking
began only after the entire generation of Jacob's children had died. 14. Bereshit Rabbah 2:5. 15. Rashi, B. Ta'anit 24b; B. Megilla 22b. 16. This entreaty comes at the end of the amidah, the main prayer,
suggesting the move from the prayer mode to the intellectual mode of Torah
study, in which one needs "light of the eyes and of the heart/mind." See B.
Berakhot 16a. 17. Zobar, 1, 209b, quoted in Torah Sbelemab, 47 [50]. 18. See Isaiah 2:2; Ezekiel 38:16; Hosea 3:5; Micah 4:1; Daniel 10:14. 19. See Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending (Oxford University Press:
1967), a study of apocalyptic movements in history and of "endings" in
literature. 20. Moses' famous cry that he is "of uncircumcised lips" is translated by
Rashi to mean "blocked, impassible, sealed." The imagery of the foreskin can
be used to suggest an excess that prevents proper functioning, of the ears
(Jeremiah 6:10), the mind (Jeremiah 9:25), or even of fruit trees, banned

420
Va-Yebi
from harvesting for the first three years (Leviticus 19:23). This notion of
atum, of the impediment that weighs down and closes off, is related to our
theme of setima, the "block." 21. SefatEmet, Va-yehi, 5635. 22. Zohar 234b. 23. B. Pesahim 56a. 24. Douglas, Purity and Danger (Penguin: 1966). 25. Shakespeare, Sonnet 129. 26. See Rashi, 31:3:" 'Return to the land of your fathers'— and there I shall

realization that his transaction with Joseph is indicated in God's blessing at Luz—
his singling out of Joseph is rooted in God's words. 39. See the chapter on Va-yetze in this volume. 40. See Seforno, who suggests that what he sees is a blurred double
presence that he cannot identify. 41. Tanhuma, Va-yehi 6. 42. See Seforno, who relates the need for vision to the capacity for
blessing, in the context of Moses' death. 43. Several commentators—e.g., Mizrahi—read pilalti as a reference to a
rigorous thought process that would hold open positive possibilities. Jacob
accuses himself of a precipitate despair, a closing of the issue without further
internal debate. See also Targum Onkelos, who translates la sivarit. 44. Bereshit Rabbati, 227-28. 45. This text is often quoted in midrashic narratives, as a key to Jacob's
later life. See, e.g., Midrash Sekhel Tov, quoted in Torah Shelemah, 87 [189];
Bereshit Rabbab, 94:4. 46. See Or Ha-Hayyim, 48:8

Va-yishlah, 8. 48. See Seforno, 48:8. 49. In most midrashic sources, it is Jacob, and not Joseph, who raises the

Joseph's survival. 55. See Rashi, 5:24: " 'Enoch walked with God; then he was no more [einenu]
for God took him': God removed him from the world before his time —
therefore the unusual expression about his death: he was not in the world to
fulfill his years." Einenu implies the removal from one world to some other
beyond man's perspective. 56. Robert Alter, The World of Biblical Literature (Basic Books: 1992), 22. 57. Ramban, 47:28. 58. Wallace Stevens, "Notes towards a Supreme Fiction." 59. Frank Kermode, "A Plain Sense of Things," in Midrash and Literature
