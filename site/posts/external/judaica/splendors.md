The Lights known as Splendors are even higher than the Emanations (_Sefiroth_) [which are the highest things that we can grasp. Still, these Splendors satisfy the soul.] This is true even though they are unreachable and unknowable, and the human intellect cannot actually comprehend them. Happy is the person who is worthy of striving in his thoughts to grasp these things.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; Likutey Moharan 24:1,8

The Infinite Being fills all worlds and provides the Life Force for them all.

Each spiritual universe contains countless entities, with myriads upon myriads of levels of angels and souls. The number of such universes is also infinite, one higher than the next.

The essence of the Infinite Being is exactly the same in the lowest worlds as it is in the highest. In this respect, it is just like the soul [which is equally present in all parts of the body].

The _Tikuney Zohar_ thus says that "He is hidden from all the hidden."

Even though the highest worlds are absolutely hidden, God is just as. hidden in them as He is in the lower world.

[The _Tikuney Zohar_ thus concludes,] "No thought can grasp Him at all" &mdash; even the highest worlds.

God therefore exists in the lower worlds in exactly the same manner that He exists in the highest worlds. The only difference between the highest spiritual worlds and the lowest ones involves the transmission of the Life Force.

The Infinite Being transmits an illumination to all worlds through an aspect of "revealing out of concealment." (Indeed, this is one of the reasons that the influence and transmission of Life Force is called "Light.") He thus gives Life Force to all worlds, as well as to the entities found therein.
