Elijah began and said: "Master of the World, You are one but not in number;[^21] You are the highest of the high, the secret of all secrets; You are altogether beyond the reach of thought. You are Het hat produced ten _tikkunim_, which we call ten _sefirot_, so that through them You might guide the secret worlds that are not revealed, and the worlds that are revealed. And through them are concealed[^22] from mankind, and You bind them and unite them. Since You are within, whoever separates one of the ten from its fellow is thought of as making a separation in You.[^23]

These ten _sefirot_ follow the order in which they are one long, one short, and one intermediate.[^24] You are the one who guides them, and there is no one to guide You, neither above nor below, nor on any side. You have prepeared garments from them,[^25] from which the souls fly to the children of men.[^26] Several bodies have You preparted from them, which are called "body" in resepect of the garments that cover them. And they are named, in this arrangement,[^27] as follows: **&#7716;esed**&mdash;right arm; **Gevurah**&mdash;left arm; **Tiferet**&mdash;torso; **Net&#7827;ac&#7717;** and **Hod**&mdash;two legs; **Yesod**&mdash;the completion of the body, the sign of the holy covenant;[^28] **Malkhut**&mdash;mouth,[^29] which we call oral Torah. The brain is **&#7716okhmah**, the inner thought; **Binah** is the heart, of which it is said "the heart understands."[^30] Of these two it is written, "The hidden things belong to the Lord, our God" (Deuteronomy 29:28). The supernal **Keter** is the crown of royalty (**malkhut**)[^31] of which it is said, "It declares the end from the beginning" (Isaiah 46:10), and it is the headpeace of the _tefillin_[^32] Inwardly it is _Yod_, _He_, _Vav_, _He_, which is the way of emanation.[^33] It is the watering-place of the tree, with its arms and boughs, like water that waters the tree, and it grows because of the watering.[^34]

Master of thw worlds, You are the Cause of causes, the First Cause, who water the tree with a spring, and this spring is like the soul to the body, for it is like the life of the body. In You there is no image, and no likeness of what is within, or of what is without.[^35] You created heaven and earth, and you have produced from them sun and moon and stars and planets, and, in the earth, trees and grasses and the Garden of Eden with wild beasts and birds and fishes and men, so that through the upper realms might be known, and how the upper and lower realms are governed, and how the upper and lower realms might be distinguished.[^36]

There is none that knows anything of You, and besides You there is no singleness and no unity in the upper or the lower worlds, and You are acknowledged as Lord over all. As for all the _sefirot_, each one has a known name, and the angels are designated by them,[^37] but You have no known name, for you fill all names, and You are the perfect completion of them all. And when You remove Yourself from them, all the names are left like a body without a soul.

You are wise but not with a known wisdom; You understand but not with a know understanding.[^38] You have no know place, except that which tells the children of Your strength and power, and shows them how the world is conducted with Justice and Mercy,[^39] which are righteousness and law, in accordance with the deeds of the children of men. Justice is **Gevurah**; law&mdash;the central pillar;[^40] righteousness&mdash;holy **Malkhut**; scales of righteousness&mdash;the two pedestals of truth;[^41] a righteous measure[^42]&mdash;the sign of the covenant.[^43]. It is all to show how the world is conducted; not that You have known righteousness which is Justice, nor a known law which is Mercy, nor any of these attributes at all.

[^21]: The unity of _En-Sof_ is not a numerical unity; it cannot be followed by a second. In this respect _En-Sof_ is differentiated from the _sefirot_, each of which is one in a series of ten.
[^22]: The _sefirot_ are stages in the development of _En-Sof_, which clothes itself in them. But they also serve as a covering that conceals its essence, since were it not for this covering the lower regions would not have the power to apprehend it at all.
[^23]: The light of _En-Sof_ in the _sefirot_ maintains their unity. Consequently, whoever assigns it to any one of the _sefirot_ maintains their unity. Consequently, whoever assigns to any one of the _sefirot_ an existence that is separate from, and independent of, the whole unified system denies, as it were, the unity of _En-Sof_ itself.
[^24]: The _sefirot_ are arranged according to a system in which there are two extreme points, **&#7716;esed** and **Din**, and an intermediate point **Ra&#7717;amin**, where the two extremes meet. The part of this harmonious triad are regarded as "long", "short", and "intermediate".
[^25]: The _sefirot_ of thw worlds _beriyah_, _ye&#7827;irah_ and _asiyah_ [see above p.250] are the garments of the divine _sefirot_ of the world of emanation. The _sefirot_ of each of these above are looked upon as the body of those below them, and the garment of the those above them.
[^26]: The soul descends in a chain through the worlds of _beriyah_, _ye&#7827;irah_ and _asiyah_ and according to the author of _Tikkunei ha-Zohar_, thet lower parts of the soul actually originate in these worlds. [See below pp. 713-714.]
[^27]: According to the structure of the human body.
[^28]: [I.e. the covenant of circumcision.]
[^29]: The mystery of speech, and there called the oral Torah, in contrast to **Tiferet**, which is the written Torah. It is possible that the reference here is to the mouth of the covenant, through which the divine influence descends.
[^30]: B.T. _Berakhot_ 61a. [_Ha-lev mevin_. Both _mevin_ and _binah_ come from the same verbal root.]
[^31]: By this designation the last _sefirah_ is connected to the first, through the mystical idea of "their end is fastened to their beginning". Hence the application to it of the scriptural phrase "it declares the end from the beginning".
[^32]: The strap that surrounds the brain, which is **&#7716;okhmah**.
[^33]: The innermost part of **Keter** is the tetragrammatron, fully spelled out&mdash;_Yod_, _He_, _Vav_, _He_&mdash;i.e. ten letters in all, signifying the ten _sefirot_, which receive influence from the light of _En-Sof_, which illuminates the inner core of **Keter**.
[^34]: The inner light of **Keter** waters **Tiferet**, which is the emanation, and the lower _sefirot_, which are the arms and boughs of the tree.
[^35]: _En-Sof_ lacks all likeness, not only of the nondivine substances (what is without) but also of the spiritual image of the _sefirot_ (what is within).
[^36]: Contemplation of the creation in the lower world leads to a knowledge of how God governs the upper and lower realms, and to a recognition of their respective natures.
[^37]: At times the angles are designated by names reserved normally for the _sefirot_, which act through their power and mediation.
[^38]: The wisdom and understanding of _En-Sof_ are essential to its nature, and not separate powers. The _sefirot_ **&#7716;okhmah** (Wisdom) and **Binah** (Understanding) are so called because the essentail wisdom and understanding of _En-Sof_ works through them.
[^39]: The _sefirot_, which have a precise and defined nature, and which seem to delimit space, are no more a revelation to mankind of the forces that control the world. But one must not assign various separate attributes to _En-Sof_ itself.
[^40]: **Tiferet**.
[^41]: **Net&#7827;ac&#7717;** and **Hod**
[^42]: [Lit. "a righteous _hin_&mdash;a measure of wheat. See Leviticus 19:36].
[^43]: **Yesod**.
