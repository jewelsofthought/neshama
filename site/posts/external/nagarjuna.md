## Introduction

Some images or comparisons [Sanskrit: _upamanas_].

_Moksa_ or final emancipation from the earthly bondage forms the chief aim of every system of philosophy in ancient India. _Upamana_, the comparison, is regarded as an independent means of valid knowledge. The final liberation can be attained through the correct knowledge of the objects. In Buddhism such _upamanas_, comparisons, are profound _dharma_ teachings leading to liberation.

For example, look at these children who are piling up earth and building castles, ramparts, villages, houses. They say that it is rice or wheat flour; they like it, they are attached to it, they keep it and they protect it. But when the evening comes, they are no longer interested in them, they tread them underfoot, they break them, destroy them, disperse them and eliminate them. Foolish worldly people do the same: as long as they do not renounce desire, they have feelings of love and attachment for _dharmas_; but as soon as they have renounced desire and see the _dharmas_, they disperse them, destroy them and reject them.

"Commentary of the Greater Perfection of Wisdom".

Author: Nagarjuna. 150 BC. India.

Translator: Kumarajiva. 402 B.C. China.

## Summary

The key terms:

- _Sunyata_ / **Emptiness**

  > Do not for a moment think Emptiness means that the objects are empty or illusionary, or that they are not real or existing.

  The Indian philosopher Nagarjuna (2nd century Current Era) is known in the history of Buddhism mainly by his keyword '_sunyata_'. This word is translated into English by the word 'emptiness'. The translation and the traditional interpretations create the impression that Nagarjuna declares the objects as empty or illusionary or not real or not existing. What is the assertion and concrete statement made by this interpretation? That nothing can be found, that there is nothing, that nothing exists? Was Nagarjuna denying the external world? Did he wish to refute that which evidently is? Did he want to call into question the world in which we live? Did he wish to deny the presence of things that somehow arise? My first point is the refutation of this traditional translation and interpretation.

- **Dependence** or 'relational view'.
  Here I transcribe '_sunyata_' by the word 'dependence'. Now Nagarjuna's central view can be named 'dependence of things'. He is not looking for a material or immaterial object which can be declared as a fundamental reality of this world. His fundamental reality is not an object. It is a relation between objects. This is **a relational view of reality**. Reality is without foundation. Or: Reality has the wide open space as foundation.

- **Connection**

  What is happening between these two 'things'? This space, the gap, is not empty, nor filled with nothing. It is not the behaviour of bodies, but the behaviour of something between them may be essential for understanding the reality. This 'empty' space is full of energy. This space is the 'middle' between things. Things are going arm-in-arm. The middle might be considered as a force that bonds men to the world and it might be seen as a force of liberation. It might be seen as a bondage to the infinite space, or as participating in the existence of infinite space.

- **Philosophy**

  Nagarjuna, we are told, was a Buddhist philosopher. This statement is not wrong when we take the notion 'philosophy' in a deep sense as a love to wisdom, not as wisdom itself. Philosophy is a way to wisdom. Where this way has an end, wisdom begins and philosophy is no more necessary. A.N. Whitehead gives philosophy the commission of descriptive generalization. We do not need necessarily a philosophical building of universal dimensions. Some steps of descriptive generalization might be enough in order to see and understand reality.

  There is another criterion of Nagarjuna's philosophy. Not his keywords 'sunyata' and 'pratityasamutpada' but his 25 philosophical examples are the heart of his philosophy. His examples are images. They do not speak to rational and conceptual understanding. They speak to our eyes. Images, metaphors, allegories or symbolic examples have a freshness which rational ideas do not possess. Buddhist dharma and philosophy is a philosophy of allegories. This kind of philosophy is not completely new and unknown to European philosophy.

- **Quantum Physics**

  European modes of thought had no idea of the space between two things. They were bound to the ideas of substance or subject, two main metaphysical traditions of European philosophical history, two main principles. These substances and these subjects are two immaterial bodies which were considered by traditional European metaphysics as lying, as a sort of core, inside the objects or underlying the empirical reality of our world.

  The first European scientist who saw the forces between two things had been Michael Faraday (1791-1867). Faraday was an English scientist who contributed to the fields of electromagnetism. Later physicists like Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg and others followed his view in modern physics.

  This is a fifth point of my work. I compare Nagarjuna with European scientific modes of thought for a better understanding of Asia. I do not compare Nagarjuna with European philosophers like Hegel, Heidegger, Wittgenstein. The principles and metaphysical foundations of physical sciences are more representative for European modes of thought than the ideas of Hegel, Heidegger and Wittgenstein and they are more precise. And slowly we are beginning to understand these principles.

  Let me take as an example the interpretation of quantum entanglement by the British mathematician Roger Penrose. Penrose discusses in the year of 2000 the experiences of quantum entanglement where light is separated over a distance of 100 kilometers and still remains connected in an unknown way. These are well known experiments in the last 30 years. Very strange for European modes of thought. The light should be either separated or connected. That is the expectation most European modes of thought tell us. Aristotle had been the first. He told us: Either a situation exists or not. There is not a third possibility.

  Now listen to Roger Penrose:

  > "Quantum entanglement is a very strange type of thing. It is somewhere between objects being separate and being in communication with each other"
  > (Roger Penrose, _The Large, the Small and the Human Mind_, Cambridge University Press. 2000, p. 66).

  This sentence of Roger Penrose is a first step of a philosophical generalization in a Whiteheadian sense.

- **The metaphysical foundations of modern science**

  These foundations had been examined particularly by three European and American philosophers: E. A. Burtt, A.N. Whitehead and Hans-Georg Gadamer. I try to follow the approaches of these philosophers of anti-substantialism and relational thought. By 'metaphysical foundations' I do not understand transcendental ideas but simply the principles that are underlying sciences.

- '**Complementarity**', '**interactions**', '**entanglements**'.
  Since 1927 quantum physics has three key terms which give an indication to the fundamental physical reality: Complementarity, interactions and entanglement. These three notions are akin to Nagarjuna's relational view of reality. They are akin and they are very precise, so that Buddhism might learn something from these descriptions and quantum physicists might learn from Nagarjuna's examples and views of reality. They might learn to do a first step in a philosophical generalisation of quantum physical experiments. All of us we might learn how objects are entangled or going arm in arm.

## Nagarjuna's view of reality

Nagarjuna was the founder of the Middle Way School, _Madhyamaka_, which became fundamental to all Tibetan Buddhist traditions. It is a path of inner liberation which avoids the extreme views of own being or substantialism and subjectivism. In Nagarjuna's main work, _Mulamadhyamaka-karika_ (MMK), the Middle Way is described as:

> "What arises dependently (_pratityasamutpada_) is pronounced to be substancelessness (_sunyata_). This is nothing but a dependent concept (_prajnapti_). Substancelessness (_sunyata_) constitutes the middle way".
> [Mulamadhyamaka-karika: chapter 24, verse 18]

Nagarjuna's view consists principally of two aspects. The first is an exposition of his view of reality (_sunyata_, _pratityasamutpada_), according to which reality has no firm core and does not consist of independent, substantial components. Reality is rather a system of two-bodies or many bodies which reciprocally affect each other[^3]. This view of reality is diametrically opposed to another key concept: '_svabhava_', 'own being' or 'inherent existence', also known in the Greek tradition as 'substance'.

The second aspect of Nagarjuna's philosophy is an answer to the inner contradictions of four extreme modes of thought which can be subsumed under the headings: 'substantialism', 'subjectivism', 'holism' and 'instrumentalism'. My thesis is that these four modes of thought are unsustainable.

### Substantialism

_Substance (or own being) is defined as something that has independent existence_.[^4]

Substantialism is at the centre of traditional metaphysics. Substance is considered to exist by itself, i.e. the unchangeable, eternal and underlying basis for the entire non-material foundation of the world in which we live. Plato made a distinction between two forms of being: on the one hand, singular objects which exist
exclusively through participation without own being and, on the other hand, ideas that do have own being. Traditional metaphysics adopted Plato's dualism.

An independent own being is characterised as something that, as an existing thing, is

- not dependent on anything else (Descartes);
- existing by itself and subsisting through itself (More);
- is completely unlimited by others and
- free from any kind of foreign command (Spinoza);
- exists of itself without anything else (Schelling).

  The highest substance was often understood as God.

Since Kant's 'Copernican Revolution' the primary question of philosophy has no longer been to comprehend reality, but rather to fathom the mind, i.e. the source of perception and knowledge. For this reason traditional metaphysics has lost ground in the modern world. In fact its central concepts, such as 'substance', 'reality', 'essence' and 'being' have been replaced by the reductionist modes of thought of modern science. Now 'atoms', 'elementary particles', 'energy', 'fields of force' and other concepts derived from the 'laws of nature' are viewed as the fundamental ground.

### Subjectivism

_Subjectivism is the philosophical theory that all knowledge is subjective, and relative_.

According to René Descartes (1596-1650) consciousness is primarily existent and everything else is sheer content or form, a creation of consciousness. Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002) emphasises that subjectivity i.e. self-awareness has become the fulcrum of modern philosophical thought which provides us with evidential proof and certainty. This view has been continually brought into doubt by modern physical science. However, these doubts have not led to a new view of reality but to a fatal separation of philosophy and the sciences. This separation has exacerbated the dualism that preoccupies modern thought. Accordingly, the physicist P.C.W. Davies, expounds in his 1986 book that electrons, photons or atoms do not exist; they are nothing but models of thought.[^5]

### Holism

_Holism is "the view that an organic or integrated whole has a reality independent of and greater than the sum of its parts"_.[^6]

The third approach avoids the fatal either-or dichotomy of the first two approaches by merging subject and object into one entity, such that there are no longer any separate parts but only one identity: all is one. 'Wholeness' is made absolute, is mystified and becomes an independent unity that exists without dependence on its parts. Wholeness is understood as something concrete as if it was a matter of fact or an object of experience. As a philosophical approach found in great periods of European history of philosophy, this view is connected with names like Thomas Aquinas (1224-1274), Leibniz (1646-1716) and Schelling (1775-1854). In quantum physics, holism is represented by David Bohm. His key concept is _'holomovement', an undivided wholeness in flowing movement_.[^7]

### Instrumentalism

_For instrumentalism, theories are not a description of the world but an instrument for a systematic classification and explanation of observations, and for the prediction of facts_.

Instead of favouring subject or object or the two together, the fourth approach ignores the existence of the other three. According to this viewpoint the search for reality is insignificant and meaningless. Instrumentalism is quite modern, intelligent and sometimes hair-splitting and hypercritical. It is difficult to disengage from it. It is an extension of subjectivism and it regards the process of thinking as model making and as working with information, without concern as to what phenomena the information is about. What philosopher Donald Davidson (1917-2003) said about subjectivism, might be true for instrumentalism also: "Once one makes the decision for the Cartesian approach, it seems that one is unable to indicate what one's proofs are evidence for".[^8]

The instrumentalist approach is outlined by the experimental physicist Anton Zeilinger who stated in an interview, "In classical physics we speak of a world of things that exists somewhere outside and we describe their nature. In quantum physics we have learned that we have to be very careful about this. Ultimately physical sciences are not sciences of nature but sciences of statements about nature. Nature in itself is always a construction of mind. Niels Bohr once put it like this:[^9]

> 'There is no world of quantum, there is only a quantum mechanical description'".

## Nagarjuna's viewpoint

Nagarjuna presents these four extreme views of reality in a scheme that is called in Sanskrit: '_catuskoti_', the equivalent of the Ancient Greek '_tetralemma_', a figure in Ancient Greek and Eastern logic with four possibilities, as follows:

     Things have no substance:
      1. neither out of themselves,
      2. nor out of something else,
      3. nor out of both,
      4. nor without a cause.

This kind of _tetralemma_ refutes the four modern views of reality as above mentioned:[^10]

> "Neither from itself nor from another, nor from both, nor without a cause, does anything whatever anywhere arise".

This verse can be understood as the principal statement of the MMK: the refutation of the four extreme metaphysical views which cannot be reconciled with the dependent arising of things.

In another text, Nagarjuna gives some indications how to understand this view. He writes in his _Yuktisastika_ (YS): 19.[^11]

> "That which has arisen dependently on this and that that has not arisen substantially (_svabhavatah_). What has not arisen substantially, how can it literally (_nama_) be called 'arisen'? […] That which originates due to a cause and does not abide without (certain) conditions but disappears when the conditions are absent, how can it be understood as 'to exist'?"

By the notions of 'to arise' and 'to exist', Nagarjuna does not mean the empirical existence but the substantial existence. When in many passages of MMK Nagarjuna states that things do not arise (MMK 7.29), that they do not exist (MMK 3.7, 5.8, 14.6), that they are not to be found (MMK 2.25, 9.11), that they are not (MMK 15.10), that they are unreal (MMK 13.1), then clearly this has the meaning: things do not arise substantially. They do not exist out of themselves; their independence cannot be found. They are dependent and in this sense they are substantially unreal.
Nagarjuna only rejects the idea of a substantial arising of things which bear an absolute and independent existence. He does not refute the empirical existence of things as explained in the following:

> "'It exists' implies grasping after eternity. It does not exist implies the philosophy of annihilation. Therefore, a discerning person should not decide on either existence or non-existence". (MMK 15.10)

For Nagarjuna, the expression 'to exist' has the meaning of 'to exist substantially'. His issue is not the empirical existence of things but the conception of a permanent thing i.e. the idea of an own being, without dependence on something else. Nagarjuna refutes the concept of independent existence which is unchangeable, eternal and existing by itself. Things do not arise out of themselves, they do not exist absolutely and are dependent. Their permanent being or existence cannot be found. The many interpretations of Nagarjuna which claim that he is also refuting the empirical existence of objects, are making an inadmissible generalization which moves Nagarjuna near to subjectivism, nihilism and instrumentalism. Such interpretations originate in metaphysical approaches which themselves have a difficulty in recognizing the empirical existence of the data presented. This is not at all the case with Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna presents the dependence of phenomena mainly in images as in the twenty-five chapters of the MMK.[^12]

### Chapter 1: Cause and effect

> A thing is not independent of its cause and conditions, nor is it identical with them.

A projectile after penetrating an apple. The penetration of the
projectile is the cause of the direct effect: the beginning of an explosion of the apple. This happens at the same moment. Cause and effect cannot be separated. They are not one object and they are not two separated objects. There is no space and no time between cause and object. The cause leads immediately to a near effect. There is not first a cause and later an effect. The most important characteristic of bodies is their interdependence and the resultant, substanceless- ness, the impossibility of existing individually and independently.

> A thing is not independent of its conditions, nor is it identical with them.

A mover does not exist without the distance within which to move. The mover and the distance are not one. A mover and the distance are neither together nor separated. The most important characteristic of bodies is their interdependence and the resultant, substanceless-ness, the impossibility of existing individually and independently.

> When there is no action there is no agent.

Neither exists per se. Action and agent are not isolated components; they arise only by their dependence on other bodies. Not the behaviour of bodies but the behaviour of something between them is essential.

### Chapter 10: Fire and fuel

![Photographer unknown](/posts/img/nagarjuna/Nagarjuna%20&%20Quantum%20Physics-37_1.jpg)

> Without fire there can be nothing designated as fuel.

The material or immaterial components of a two-body or three-body system do not exist in isolation, they are not one and yet they are not independent of each other. Something is happening between these bodies and because of this, they are not substantially real. Nagarjuna emphasises one central idea: bodies are neither together nor separated. The most important characteristic of bodies is their interdependence and the resultant, substancelessness, the impossibility of an independent and individual existence.

> Suffering is not independent from a cause of suffering and not identical with its cause.

There can be no cause without an effect, or an effect without a cause. The notion 'cause' has no meaning without the notion 'effect'. Cause and effect are not one, but they cannot be separated into two independent notions either. Like suffering, reality does not consist of single, isolated material or immaterial components; suffering arises only by dependence on other causes. Like everything in this world suffering and its cause are not one and they are not two different objects.

For two complementary realities, bondage and liberation, the nature and the existence of each are dependent on the other. There is no fundamental core to reality; rather reality consists of systems of interacting facts or ideas.

Usually two waters get mixed when they come together. These two impure waters remain separated in the same river at the beginning of the Amazon. Only after 30 km they are completely mixed. A fundamental or elementary or independent idea or notion does not exist. Our ideas or notions are dependent. One notion is contingent upon another.

### Interpretation of MMK's 25 chapters

In 25 out of 27 chapters, Nagarjuna emphasizes one central idea: bodies (_dharma_) are neither together nor separated. The do not clump and stick together. The most important characteristic of bodies is their interdependence and the resultant, substancelessness, the impossibility of existing individually and independently. This is the meaning of _pratityasamutpada_ and _sunyata_: bodies (_dharma_) are without own being and are not independent of each other. Reality does not consist of single, isolated material or immaterial components. It is not the behaviour of independent bodies but the behaviour of something between them that is essential.

Let us concentrate on the 25 chapters: a thing is not independent of its conditions, nor is it identical with them. A mover does not exist without the distance within which to move. The mover and the distance are not one. They do not adhere to one another and they do not agglomerate to form larger bodies (_dharma_). A viewer is not the same as the view, but a viewer without a view does not exist. There can be no cause without an effect, or an effect without a cause. The notion 'cause' has no meaning without the notion 'effect'. Cause and effect are not one, but they cannot be separated into two independent notions either. Without a characteristic, we cannot speak of a character- ization, and the other way round. How could there be a desirous one without desire? When there is no action there is no agent, neither exists per se. Without fire there can be nothing designated as fuel.

The material or immaterial components of a two-body or three-body system do not exist in isolation. They are not one and yet they are not independent of each other. Something is happening between these bodies and because of this they are not substantially real. For two or sometimes three complementary bodies or for two concepts like cause and effect, or bondage and liberation, the nature and the existence of each are dependent on the other. The one arises with the other and disappears with the other. This is why a thing doesn't arises substantially, neither out of itself, nor out of another, nor out of both, nor without a cause. There is no fundamental core to reality; rather reality consists of systems of interacting bodies. This view of reality is first and foremost an idea; a pointer to reality which cannot be described in words. One who can speak about concept-free reality has not experienced it. For the Buddhist tradition based on Nagarjuna, the yogic experience of substancelessness, the experience of dependent arising, the direct perception of reality as it is, all presuppose a high level of spiritual realisation which entails the abandonment of extreme views and the demolition of the entire edifice of dualistic thought and philosophy. To experience _pratityasamutpada_ or _sunyata_ means to become free of all entanglements of this world. _Nirvana_ is simply another expression for this.

### Discussion of Nagarjuna's work

For Nagarjuna, the primary question was not about mind, nor about the origin of knowledge but about the reality of the physical world we are living in. Tarab Tulku Rinpoche presented an all encompassing position when he said:[^13]

> "everything existing partakes in a fundamental 'mind-field', which is the basic 'substance' from which mind in a more individual way and the individual body develop".

In order to emphasise that Nagarjuna does not only speak about views without substance but also about bodies (_dharma_) without substance, here is a comparison with the views of reality suggested by quantum physicists. This is the reason for the title of this Essay: "_Eastern and Western Modes of Thought_". In order to understand Eastern modes of thought we should try to see our own modes of thought, our own traditional preconditions. In the modern Western world we have our own preconditions to see the modes of thought of Asia. We cannot deny this. We should not minimise the importance of our own modes of thought when we give an interpretation of Nagarjuna's philosophy. I try to understand Nagarjuna's philosophy from a view of 'interaction' and entanglement' in modern physics or the behaviour of something between bodies (Albert Einstein). I try to understand modern physics from Nagarjuna's view of 'dependence of things'. Among these physical notions, there is not one that directly engages the principle of '_sunyata_' or '_pratityasamutpada_'. A notion such as 'entanglement' is not the same. It is akin to '_sunyata_' or '_pratityasamutpada_'. It has similar qualities. There are many notions in the history of European philosophy which try to express that what bounds one object to one another. The philosopher A.N. Whitehead mentions more than 20 different notions to express his idea of the prehension (the act of seizing or grasping) or the connection or the relation of things. (Attachment, solidarity, relatedness, structural connection, cooperation, interaction, the networking of systems and many others.) We read in Whitehead's _Adventures of Ideas_, an explanation for the great variety of the terms:

    "Finally civilized language provides a whole group of words, each embodying the general idea under its own specialization. If we desire to reach the generality common to these various specializations, we must gather together the whole group of words with the hope of discerning their common element. This is a necessary procedure for the purpose of philosophical generalization. The premature use of one familiar word inevitably limits the required generalization by importing the familiar special connotation of that word".

    (A.N. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, Free Press, New York 1967, p. 236)

Physics is about views and the conditions of physical reality. It creates models and thus examines only realities which have been posited by physics itself. Nevertheless, as the experimental psychologist Irvin Rock, who studied visual perception, describes it, we should not go so far as to consider all our perceptions and thought models to be purely adventitious. While the constructions of our mind are not identical with reality, they are not purely coincidental and usually not deceptive.[^14] Behind these models are empirical
bodies and there is some approximation of a structural similarity between a physical model and the corresponding physical and tangible reality.

## Quantum Physics

### The metaphysical foundations of quantum physics

This is not a presentation or criticism of quantum physics but a discussion of the metaphysical views and principles which underlie quantum physics. The views of reality in quantum physics can be expressed by three key terms: 'complementarity', 'four interactions' and 'entanglement'.[^15] In the prehistory of quantum physics it could not be proved experimentally whether the smallest elements of light were particles or waves. Many experiments argued in favour of one or the other assumption. Electrons and photons sometimes act like waves and sometimes like particles. This 'behaviour' was named: wave- particle dualism. The idea of dualism was therein understood to be a logical contradiction, in the sense that only one or the other could actually apply; but paradoxically both appeared.

According to this understanding of traditional atomic theory, electrons and photons cannot be both particles and waves. According to atomic theory, a scientific explanation consists of a reduction of a variable factor into its permanent components and their applicable mathematical laws. This is the fundamental dualistic view that modern atomic theory has inherited from the natural philosophy of the ancient Greeks who expounded that substance and permanence cannot be found in objects of perception of the world in which we live, but can be found in the fundamental elements making up objects and their mathematical order. These material and immaterial foundations hold the world together, they do not change, although everything else changes.

According to the expectation of traditional atomic theory, it should be possible to reduce an object to its _independent_ elements, to its mathematical laws, or to its simple and fundamental principles. Until 1927 the fundamental elements had to be either particles or waves, they could not be both. What is to be understood by independent elements? As mentioned before, the notion of substance refers to something that has \_independent\_\_ existence.

### Albert Einstein's contribution to the interpretation of quantum physics

Albert Einstein was following the aforementioned metaphysical tradition when he wrote in the year of 1948 very clearly:[^16]

    "For the classification of things that are introduced in physics, it is essential that these things have for a certain time an independent existence from each other, in so far as these things lie 'in different parts of space'. Without the assumption of such an independent existence [Einstein uses the German term _So-sein_, this is akin to terms like substance, or being, or suchness] of things which, in terms of ordinary thought, are spatially distant from each other, physical thought in the usual sense would not be possible".

This idea of an independent reality was projected onto the basic element of the world of matter by atomic theory. For atomic theory, a scientific explanation means to reduce the variability and variety of objects and conditions to their permanent, stable, independent, and indivisible elements and to their conformity with mathematical laws.

According to the expectations of traditional atomic theory, all variations in nature can be explained in terms of separation, association and movements of unchanging, independent atoms or still more elementary particles. These particles and their conformity to mathematical laws constitute the core of bodies. They underlie everything and hold the world together. The question whether the fundamental objects are waves or particles was an explosive issue: at stake were the traditional metaphysical views of reality available to quantum physics.

It became evident that fundamental reality could not be grasped by traditional views of reality. What is the explanatory value of traditional atomic theory based on Democritus, if it becomes clear that there are no independent, stable atoms or elementary particles, and that objects have no stable core? Are these quantum objects objective, subjective, both or neither? What is reality? Is the quantum world completely distinct from the world in which we live?

### Niels Bohr's contribution to the interpretation of quantum physics

In 1927, the physicist Niels Bohr introduced the idea of **complementarity** into quantum physics. According to this idea, the wave form and the particle form are not two separate forms which contradict and exclude each other but are mutually complementary forms which can provide a complete description of physical manifestations only together. According to Niels Bohr, complementarity means that in the quantum world it is impossible to speak about independent quantum objects because they are in an interactive relationship with each other as well as with the instrument of measurement. He emphasized that this interaction between the quantum object and the instrument of measurement was an inseparable element of quantum objects, because it plays a major part in the development of several features of them. Certain measurements establish electrons or photons as particles and destroy the interference that distinguishes the object as a wave. Other measurements establish the object as a wave. This was Niels Bohr's new idea of reality. From the insight that the quantum object and the instrument of measurement could not be separated, Niels Bohr did not conclude that there are no quantum objects. At least he did not do so when he was arguing in terms of physics. When he spoke about the metaphysics of quantum physics he took an instrumentalist approach.

For the physicist Niels Bohr, quantum physical objects consist of interacting and complementary quantum objects.[^17]

**The double-slit experiment**.
![The double-slit experiment](/posts/img/nagarjuna/Nagarjuna%20&%20Quantum%20Physics-52_1.jpg)

If you send an atom of helium trough a double-slit, every atom produces a point behind the double-slit. The atoms arrive in discrete lumps. There is no interference in the beginning. The atoms arrive like bullets at the screen. But later they show interference. Their appearance shows the structure of waves in a similar manner to waves on water. The seven pictures shown were taken at intervals ranging from 5 minutes to 42 hours and 18 minutes. Quantum objects show a double quality of particles and of waves. They are dependent on the instrument of measurement: the double slit. This double quality has been named 'complementarity' by Niels Bohr.

**Dipole.**
(Haken, H./Wolf, H.C., Atom und Quantenphysik. Springer Verlag Berlin 2000. With the permission of Springer Verlag.)

Complementarity means that the two qualities are not dualistic. They do not exclude each other but complement each other like the poles of a dipole.

**Feynman Diagram**

In this Feynman diagram, an electron (left) and a positron (left) annihilate each other, producing a photon (represented by the blue sine wave) that becomes a quark/anti-quark pair (right). The photon represents the electromagnetic interaction or electromagnetic force.

### The concepts of interactions in the standard model of quantum physics

The notion of four elementary interactions was introduced in the standard model of quantum physics. These four forces obstruct the reduction of quantum objects into independent objects. Such an idea had already been posited by Democritus (460? - 370? BCE). These interactional forces which operate between the quantum objects, are added to the quantum objects. Instead of singular, independent objects, two-body systems or many-body systems were established as the base of matter. Between the bodies, interacting forces are effective in keeping them together.[^18]

These interactions are a composite of the bodies. Mostly they are forces of attraction and in the case of electro-magnetic forces they can also be forces of repulsion. One visualises the interaction between the elementary particles as an interaction of elementary particles. The physicist Steven Weinberg puts it like this:[^19]

    "At the present moment the closest we can come to a unified view of nature is a description in terms of elementary particles and their mutual interactions. [...] The most familiar are gravitation and electromagnetism, which, because of their long range, are experienced in the everyday world. Gravity holds our feet on the ground and the planets in their orbits. Electromagnetic interactions of electrons and atomic nuclei are responsible for all the familiar chemical and physical properties of ordinary solids, liquids and gases. Next, both in range and familiarity, are the 'strong' interactions, which hold protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus. The strong forces are limited in range to about 10-13 centimetre and so are quite insignificant in ordinary life, or even in the scale (10-8 centimetre) of the atom. Least familiar are the 'weak' interactions. They are of such short range (less than 10-15 centimetre) and are so weak that they do not seem to play a role in holding anything together".

In this respect, the explanations enter into quite difficult and subtle particulars. How, for example, can an electron which consists only of one particle be in interaction with another quantum object? What part of itself can it emit if it consists only of one particle? These questions can be answered by the concept of interaction. In fact an electron does not exist of only a single particle exactly because the interaction of the electron is a part of it. In 1978 The physicists Daniel Z. Freedman and Pieter van Nieuwenhuizen wrote in this regard that:[^20]

    "the observed electron mass is the sum of the 'bare mass' and the 'self-energy' resulting from the interaction of the electron with its own electromagnetic field. Only the sum of  the two terms is observable".

What in quantum physics is known about interactions is here summarized in the words of the physicist and Nobel prize laureate Gerard 't Hooft:[^21]

    "An electron is surrounded by a cloud of virtual particles, which it continually emits and absorbs. This cloud does not consist of photons only, but also of pairs of charged particles, for example electrons and their anti-particles, the positrons. […] Even a quark is surrounded by a cloud of gluons and pairs of quark and anti-quark".

Singular, isolated, independent quarks, a phenomenon which is called
'confinement' in recent research, have never been observed. Quarks are
captives, they cannot appear on their own but only as one of a pair or as one of a trio. When you try to separate two quarks by force, new quarks will appear between them which combine into pairs and trios. Claudio Rebbi and other physicists have reported that,[^22]

    "between the quarks and gluons inside an elementary particle, additional quarks and gluons are continuously formed and after a short time again subside".

These clouds of virtual particles represent or produce interactions. The central core of quantum physics consists of a new view of reality that no longer perceives singular, independent elements but rather two-body systems, two states of a quantum object or two concepts, e.g., earth/moon, proton/electron, proton/neutron, quark/anti-quark, wave/measuring instrument, particle/measuring instrument, twin photons, super-positions, spin-up/spin-down, matter/anti-matter, elementary particle/field of force, law of nature/matter, etcetera.

These systems cannot be separated into independent parts, or reduced to two separate, independent bodies or states, nor is one fundamental and the other derived, as the metaphysical either-or schemes of substantialism and subjectivism try to establish. They are not joined into a seamless unity either, they are not the same, they are not identical and they are not a mysterious wholeness as holism indicates.

Finally, we cannot claim, as instrumentalists do, that they are nothing but mathematical models which we have constructed and which do not correspond to physical reality. In physics, there is a fundamental reality that is not a one-body system. It is a two-body system or an assembly of bodies, a cloud of virtual particles which surround the
central or 'naked' body. Between these bodies is an interaction that is one of the composites of them.

This understanding of physics cannot be dislodged and yet all our metaphysical schemata struggle against it. The cloud does not conform to our traditional expectations of what should delineate and underpin stability, substantiality and order. How can clouds be what we are used to calling the basic elements of matter? How can this small vibrating something be what generations of philosophers and physicists have been searching for in order to arrive at the core of matter, the ultimate reality? Is this supposed to be it?

From these little clouds we attempt to use metaphysical interpretation to distil something that has substance and is enduring. Entirely within the sense of the substance metaphysics of Plato, Heisenberg (1901-1976) contends that the mathematical forms are the idea of elementary particles and that the object of elementary particles corresponds with this mathematical idea. The physicist and philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker (1912-2007) called mathematics 'the
essence of nature'. According to the physicist Schopper, fields of force are the ultimate reality.[^23] Some of us want to see reality as a mysterious whole (holism) or dismiss it as a construction without any correspondence to empirical reality (instrumentalism). All of this only because we do not find it easy to admit that the complex interactions of the world in which we live have their roots in a reality that is in itself complex.

It is impossible to escape from the entanglement of this world in quantum physics and, to find an elementary quantum object that is not dependent on other quantum objects or on parts of itself. It is also impossible to dissolve the double-sided character of quantum objects. The fundamental reality of our physical world consists of clouds of interacting quantum objects.

## Conclusion

It seems that reality is not static, solid or independent and does not consist of singular, isolated material or immaterial factors, but of systems of dependent bodies. Most systems consist of more than two bodies, but there is no system that consists of less than two bodies. In quantum physics we call such fundamental two-body systems: earth/moon, electron/positron, quark/anti-quark, particle/field, etcetera. Nagarjuna calls his systems or dependent pairs: mover/distance to move within, fire/fuel, agent/action, viewer/view, etcetera.

Both, quantum physicists and Nagarjuna deal with two-body systems or two entities which have bodies that are neither properly separate, nor properly joined together. They do not unite into one, nor do they fall apart. These bodies are not independent and cannot be observed singly because in their very existence and constitution they are dependent on each other and cannot exist or function independently.

They are entangled by interactions, even at a far distance. One of them cannot be reduced to the other and it is not possible to explain one of them on the basis of the other. The resultant systems have a fragile stability, the components of which are maintained by interactions and mutual dependencies which are sometimes known, sometimes not fully known and sometimes totally unknown (for example as with entangled twin photons).

What is reality? We have become accustomed to believe in a firm ground under our feet and fleeting clouds above in the sky. The view of reality in Nagarjuna's thought and the ideas of complementarity, interactions and entanglement of quantum physics teach us that everything is built on sand. Moreover, even the grains of sand are not endowed with a solid nucleus. Their stability is based on balancing unstable interactions of their components.

## Appendices

### Appendix 1: Meanings of pratityasamutpada

In the first place _pratityasamutpada_ is an indication of dependence. Dependent bodies are in an intermediate state - they are not properly separated and they are not one entity. Secondly, they rely on each other and are influenced or determined by something else. Thirdly, their behaviour is influenced by something in-between, for example a mover is attracted by gravitational force, a viewer is dependent on rays of light between his eyes and the object, a piano player's action is determined by the fine motor skills of his fingers, an agent is dependent on his act. _Pratityasamutpada_ is an indication of dependence and of something that happens between the objects. One object is bound to the other without being identical to it. The implicit interpretations of pratityasamutpada, are in terms of time, structure and space.

The following citations and references illustrate the term _pratityasamutpada_. _Pratityasamutpada_ is used:

1. as Dependence in Nagarjuna's Hymn to the Buddha:[^24]

    "Dialecticians maintain that suffering is created by itself, created by (someone) else, created by both (or) without a cause, but You have stated that it is dependently born".

2. as an intermediate state by Nagarjuna:

    "Objects are neither together nor separated" (Nagarjuna, MMK 6. 10).

3. as bondage in the _Hevajra Tantra_:[^25]

    "Men are bound by the bondage of existence and are liberated by understanding the nature of existence".

4. as an intermediate state by Roger Penrose:[^26]

    "Quantum entanglement is a very strange type of thing. It is somewhere between objects being separate and being in communication with each other".

5. as something between bodies by Albert Einstein: [^27]

    "A courageous scientific imagination was needed to realize fully that not the behaviour of bodies, but the behaviour of something between them, that is, the field, may be essential for ordering and understanding events".

6. as the mean between things in modern mathematics: to quote Gioberti again:[^28]

    "The mean between two or more things, their juncture, union, transit, passage, crossing, interval, distance, bond and contact – all these are mysterious, for they are rooted in the continuum, in the infinite. The interval that runs between one idea and another, one thing and another, is infinite, and can only be surpassed by the creative act. This is why the dynamic moment and dialectic concept of the mean are no less mysterious than those of the beginning and the end. The mean is a union of two diverse and opposite things in a unity. It is an essentially dialectic concept, and involves an apparent contradiction, namely, the identity of the one and the many, of the same and the diverse. This unity is simple and composite; it is unity and synthesis and harmony. It shares in two extremes without being one or the other. It is the continuum, and therefore the infinite. Now, the infinite identically uniting contraries, clarifies the nature of the interval. In motion, in time, in space, in concepts, the discrete is easy to grasp, because it is finite. The continuum and the interval are mysterious, because they are infinite".

### Appendix 2: What is quantum entanglement?

Two very short answers:

According to Clegg:[^29]

>       "Entanglement is a strange feature of quantum physics, the science of the very small. It's possible to link together two quantum particles — photons of light or atoms, for example — in a special way that makes them effectively two parts of the same entity. You can then separate them as far as you like, and a change in one is instantly reflected in the other. This odd, faster than light link, is a fundamental aspect of quantum science. Schrödinger, who came up with the name 'entanglement' called it 'the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics'. Entanglement is fascinating in its own right, but what makes it really special are dramatic practical applications that have become apparent in the last few years".

``
According to Merali:[^30]

>      "This weird quantum effect inextricably links two or more objects in such a way that measurements carried out on one immediately change the properties of its partners, no matter how far apart they are. Quantum effects, such as entanglement, are usually confined to the invisible microscopic world and are detected only indirectly using precision instruments".

### Appendix 3: A. N. Whitehead and Albert Einstein about Modern Physics

> "Newtonian physics is based upon the independent individuality of each bit of matter. Each stone is conceived as fully describable apart from any reference to any other portion of matter. It might be alone in the universe, the sole occupant of uniform space. But it would still be that stone which it is. Also the stone could be adequately described without any reference to past or future. It is to be conceived fully and adequately as wholly constituted within the present moment. This is the full Newtonian concept, which bit by bit was given away, or dissolved, by the advance of modern physics. It is the thorough-going doctrine of 'simple location' and of 'external relations'. There was some divergence of opinion as to the external relations. Newton himself was inclined to construe them in terms of shock and stress between contiguous bodies. But his immediate followers, such as Roger Cotes, added the notion of force at a distance. But either alternative was wholly and completely a fact of that external relation between two bits of matter either contiguous or distant. (…) We have to discover a doctrine of nature which expresses the concrete relatedness of physical functionings, of the past with the present, and also expresses the concrete composition of physical realities which are individually diverse.

> Modern physics has abandoned the doctrine of Simple Location. The physical things which we term stars, planets, lumps of matter, molecules, electrons, protons, quanta of energy, are each to be conceived as modifications of conditions within space-time, extending throughout its whole range. There is a focal region, which in common speech is where the thing is. But its influence streams away from it with finite velocity throughout the utmost recess of space and time".

> (A.N. Whitehed, Adventures of Ideas, Free Press New York 1967, p.160,161)

Albert Einstein's view is not different.

> "Physics reality began with the invention of mass, force, and an inertial system. These concepts are all free inventions. They led to the formulation of the mechanical point of view. For the physicists of the early nineteenth century, the reality of our outer world consisted of particles with simple forces acting between them and depending only on the distance. He tried to retain as long as possible his belief that he would succeed in explaining all events in nature by these fundamental concepts of reality. The difficulties connected with the deflection of the magnetic needle, the difficulties connected with the structure of the ether, induced us to create a more subtle reality. The important invention of the electromagnetic field appears. A courageous scientific imagination was needed to realize fully that not the behaviour of bodies, but the behaviour of something between them, that is, the field, may be essential for ordering and understanding events" ...

> "What impresses our senses as matter is really a great `concentration` of energy into a comparatively small space".

> (Albert Einstein, Leopold Infield, _The Evolution of Physics_. Cambridge University Press. London 1938, page 311-312)

The deuterion, made up of a proton and a neutron, represents a model system for studies of the forces in the atomic nucleus. Now there is a bound system in which to investigate the force that acts between quarks, the constituents of protons, neutrons and many related particles. The system is called quarkonium, and it consists of a heavy quark bound to an equally massive antiquark. The force at work in quarkonium is the strongest one known; it has come to be called the colour force, and it is now thought to be the basis of all nuclear forces. Of the various two-body systems the simplest in some respects is the artificial atom called positronium"
