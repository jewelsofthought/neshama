This is just a little journey down the rabbit hole of scientific terminology. We use some of the basic scientific terms, like facts and laws based on our social understanding of such terms. This creates a social narrative based on science. Whereas before such narratives were based on theological and philosphical ideas, now they are based essentially on scientific "facts", which makes science the theology of our modern society.

Science is a philosophy in that it is a way to look at the world around us, our existence, from a certain perspective. One which stands in contrast to the religious view, a view in which there is an overriding, and unknown, intelligence within and as a cause of, our universe. Science questions that by looking at the manifestation around us, and by collecting empirical data, tries to find a rational explanation for it, that is useful for predicting empirical events. Its weakness lies in not being able to correctly predict anything that is non-empirical&mdash;or not able to be measured.

> A fact is an existing structured component of reality that is the truthmaker for a true proposition. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means.

All the examples that follow speak of a fact within a specific framework, as in a linguistic, historical or astronomically context. This presupposes a whole slew of prior agreements, so that within that particular context, it is a fact.

The word fact derives from the Latin factum. It was first used in English with the same meaning: "a thing done or performed" â€“ a meaning now obsolete.[1] The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the mid-16th century.[1]

Roger Bacon wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."[10] Whereas, in mathematics, a fact is a statement (called a theorem) that can be proven by logical argument from certain axioms and definitions.

The definition of a scientific fact is different from the definition of fact, as it implies knowledge. _Similarly, does it not require knowledge to acknowledge any fact as in fact a fact?_ In the most basic sense, a scientific fact is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a hypothesis or theory, which is intended to explain or interpret facts.[18]

The definition of a scientific fact is different from the definition of fact, as it implies knowledge. A scientific fact is the result of a repeatable careful observation or measurement by experimentation or other means, also called empirical evidence. These are central to building scientific theories. Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the scientific method, and the scope and validity of scientific reasoning.
