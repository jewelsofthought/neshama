## Trust

Trust is based on truth. At first I wanted to refer to it as the "Web of Truth" - but then the criterion of judgement of the Truth or Falsity of a statement is a complex, especially if socio-economic and political dynamics are in play. However, as Truth engenders trust, and people have different standards of trust - depending on their environment and cultural makeup. One has to gain trust, but prove truth. Therefore, we wish to build a Web of Trust, but basing it on Truth.

A characteristic of complex systems is that they are self-organising. Which means that each element, including the element that contains all (or part) of these elements, "self" regulates, or regulates itself.

{NOTE: This is a typical objectification, a separation. The same separation we make between us & G-d - as something that exists outside of myself - which makes me "self" sovereign {sovereign to myself, and no one else}. We then have the option to reject or accept that outside element. Instead, we are entangled, so much so, t hat it is often difficult to tell the two - what is truly me & what is G-d - apart.

The most important things to keep in mind are:

1. A perception of something is not the thing itself, but an "imaginary" or "made-up" version of the actual "thing".
2. There is not someone or something out there having an experience separate from your experience.. Although you could imagine such a thing, the only "experience" you can have of it, is your own "lived" - and therefore limited - experience of it.

## Human$\Leftrightarrow$Interface

How human is the interface between the human and the AI/MI? This is not an AI problem, it is a human system interface (HIS - Human Interface to the System) problem.

(Ai Mi -> HAI/MAI -> Hai, Hmi so as not to forget the Human element)

Two levels:

1. Human level (anthropomorphic, narcissistic)
2. System level (objectification $\Leftrightarrow$ virtualisation)

Interface:

- where "consciousness", as a separate identity encounters the "non-conscious"

Empirical $\Leftrightarrow$ non-consciousness. It tracks dead (literally non-conscious) events. Based on data, i.e. measurement, recording, etc which is non-human.

## Ground state

This information is gathered for the living entity which has to maintain a certain stasis/ground state or stable state, which would make it's form recognisable/perceivable.

## Non-human consciousness (NHC)

NHC is apparent in all species, in fact, in the world around us. However, we have a form of NHC which we have created (also could be thought of as the narrative that we overlay over reality to calm our fears)

We are so eager to embrace NHC, but have yet to acknowledge the trove we are surrounded by.
