   Sophisticated electronic solutions to biologically inspired problems.

   Electronic BioSciences (EBS) develops state-of-the-art instrumentation for research and sensing applications. Our technology is centered on the measurement of electrical current through [biological](http://electronicbio.com/pages/tech_protein_pores_bilayers.php) and [inorganic](http://electronicbio.com/pages/tech_nanopores.php) nanopores.

   From a [popular website](https://www.raiseupwa.com)
   [What proteins form pores?](https://www.raiseupwa.com/popular-guidelines/what-proteins-form-pores/)

   ... we have optimized the process for nanopore fabrication and integrated the device into specially designed systems. By working across all levels of the technology, we are able to produce systems with state-of-the-art sensitivity and performance. (Marketing)
