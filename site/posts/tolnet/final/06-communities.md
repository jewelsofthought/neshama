## Stage IV: Web of communities

In order for a new paradigm to emerge, we need to create and support communities whose transactions are not money based, and especially not based on a fiat system and/or a credit/debit economy. From its inception, these communities will aim to provide all the basic necessities of life to all members of the community, as well as to any member that visits the community, within reason. Those that reside in this community will labour to maintain and support the community, but no transactions inside the community will be based on money. All internal decisions regarding the disbursement of resources will be based on communal need and be for the benefit of the community, and thus the individuals that comprise this community.

The goal of these communities will be to become as self-reliant – or rather, reliant on the network – as possible. This would enable them to become essentially money-free – their transactions could be valued and tracked by a network-wide crypto-currency. These communities will live in a shared economy, as much as they are able. They are only moneyless within the community. Due to the fact that they will be arising in the current system, they will still need to relate to the surrounding world in which money is a determining factor. One could say that internally the communities are money-free, but externally they will still be bound by fiat currency money.

If all trading took place on as local a domain as possible, and, as is the general principle of the network, only trade wider if there is excess available. In this first case, the wider domain will still remain, if sensible and possible, within the network space. However, if there is an over-abundance available, and the network does not require it, it can be traded externally to the network. This will bring cash into the network, to provide products and services that this web of communities cannot, and to expedite its growth.

At this stage, any crypto-currency has to become fiat (or fiat equivalent) currency to deal with most of today’s requirements. The only way to make this crypto-currency viable is by creating an eco-system that can transact and provide most of the needs of this eco-system – which I refer to as a web of communities. There is a tipping point at which this web can become self-reliant enough to be able to sustain a community currency, in the same way that any local currency has been able to. The difference is the potential global reach of this eco-system – in that it is able to transact across borders with ease, thus enabling easier resource transfer as well.
What if it also levelled the global economic playing field by paying an equal rate in crypto-currency for work done (proof of work) no matter where the person was located?

Let me explain. In the bitcoin arena, I have a fiat price that I wish to charge for my item. Say $\$10 = N$ bitcoin. If I want to purchase that item, I will have to pay $N$ bitcoin, which is, say, R$150$ in my currency. Thus I have paid $R150 = \$10$ for the item, yet in the bitcoin realm, I have paid $N$ bitcoin – the same amount, no matter what fiat currency I am coming from.

Let us say, an engineer in the US, receives $\$100$ an hour for his work. That equals $M$ bitcoin. An engineer in South Africa, working through the network, will get $M$ bitcoin per hour as well, which equates to $R1500$ an hour, if cashed in – an excellent hourly rate.

In whatever form the organisational structure appears, it will be permeated by the Tree of Life network, or a sub-tree thereof, to enable equal communication and representation – though only used in time of need.
These communities will be networked to co-operate and collaborate so as to make them self-reliant and independent of any other inputs except for those that come from the network itself. We refer to them as eco-communities, for they will practise the ethics of the eco-movement, and produce/consume organic produce, produce/use renewable energy, avoid toxic materials, and, even further, produce their own clothes, eventually providing essential services like health support and education.

This would incorporate the mapping of a tree of interaction of these communities in order to facilitate interaction and support, regarding both resources (educational and material), as well as to become suppliers to the greater network.

Once such a global network of communities was established, and an individual who belonged to one community wished for a change, he could then transfer to another community, living according to the same money-less principles. This will become an autonomous space, a cyber-nation, whose “place” consists of a network of diverse communities.

It will be a nation where any e-resident of this nation can transfer between any community and be cared for. If someone wants to obtain “residency” in the network, they will have to commit deeply to the network, and be living on or in one of the existing communities – or create a new one. All that these communities require is for the person to work diligently to maintain their community and the Tree of Life network as a whole. The community works as a unit, sharing resources, talents, etc., to benefit the community as a whole, and thus the members themselves.

The members’ time can be focused on the important things in their lives and the lives of their community, rather than having to always worry about taking care of basic needs. Thus all spare time can be spent on improving the network in whatever way possible – small or big. In this scenario, people will have enough time and energy to uphold a civic system like the Tree of Life network.

These communities are both urban and rural.
