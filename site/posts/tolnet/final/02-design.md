        One of the most important insights of the systems view of life is the recognition that networks are the basic pattern of organization of all living systems. Ecosystems are understood in terms of food webs (i.e., networks of organisms); organisms are networks of cells; cells are networks of molecules; and then social networks are networks of communications. The network is a pattern that is common to all life. Wherever we see life, we see networks.
