## Stage 1: Connect to the network

            Various Types of Networks

In its most basic form, the model is simply a network. All those who are interested in change and believe that there is a better way to do things, and agree on the most critical criteria of change, are geolocated with digital identities. They form the essential core unit, the nucleus and perhaps the most important part of the Tree of Life network. We, the people, are the reason that the network and its associated structures are to be created.

The core principle of the model is: “for the benefit of the community (network) as a whole – with particular focus on those who are most affected by whatever decisions are implemented”. It is an expression of “act locally, think globally”. There are also other core principles, such as sharing, non-violence, transparency, equality, equal representation, responsiveness, etc.

All organisations consist of a web of trust that interacts with other webs. These webs are made up of affinity groups, with this affinity existing on many different levels. It may be financial, familial, philosophical, cultural, or religious.

Friends form an affinity group that you are part of: they are people you are close to, and with whom you share parts of your life. That group may be connected to another pod in a web that might consist of an organisation like a department in a university, or a team that is part of a project occurring in a corporation, radiating further and further outwards.

We are all connected via these strands that link us. The tapestry of our lives and the human race itself – in fact the whole bio-system – consists of these webs that interact with one another.

If this is so, one might ask, then what is the element that we would like to insert into this web within a web that already exists? It is one of consciousness – that is, of becoming conscious of these interactions, and their potential. We need to consciously create a network. In other words, a network of “conscious” beings need to connect to form the initial network. Once the protocols are in place, it will be able to absorb others who are less conscious of what constitutes the true state of the world and humanity.

Initial requirements for joining the network are:

1. Agreement with the basic principles of the network;
2. Be invited or sponsored by someone in the network;
3. Validation by your sponsor and two other members;
4. Willingness to put some energy into the network.

The members will consist of people who:

1. Are implementing this lifestyle fully or partially, need support and would like to expand their involvement in creating an alternative way of life – one which is more in balance with the bio-dynamics of the environment in which we exist;
2. Wish to support people that are from (1), who will eventually join and fully participate in this venture &ndash; see [Supporting members](....html);
3. Are unhappy with the status quo, and would like to engage in another way of life, but are not sure what that is.

            Clustering in two-mode network

These people are then mapped into a basic communications network. This follows the principle of first connecting the people, and thereafter building the network that provides them connectivity, rather than first building the network, and trying to find or entice the people to join after the fact.

The focus will be on the people, and the network will provide support to the members of the network. It is built “by the people for the people”. Building this type of communications network is a well-represented topic. The difference in this instance is that those algorithms are usually used to connect computers and devices, while the Tree of Life network focuses on enhancing connectivity between people.
