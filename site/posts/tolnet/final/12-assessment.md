### Core Values

A guiding principle of the Tree of Life network will be “for the benefit of the people” who are directly affected by the decision, as well as those that comprise the network and the network as a whole. Because the network is a local network, with a more global reach, the wider spread macro-effects are taken into account as well.

A requirement of joining would be to agree to the core principles of the network. These values can be embedded as a smart contract, and included in any transactions that take place in the network, expressed via the crypto-currency that the network will use.

### Decision-making Capacity

The method by which decisions are formulated is incorporated in the tree-like structure of the network, with the additional constraint that all information must propagate up (and down) the tree. It does not “jump”, unless in specific situations. Information propagates inwards by areas of concern or activity, passing up from “family” via “parents” to the next level, the “grandparents”, and so on. The base level must be the source of the decision, though the issue may arise from the leaf – the bottom – or come down from the macro – the parental groups that are collating information on the more global scale – in which case it is distributed all the way down again to the af-groups at the leaves of the tree. All levels above the perimeter level (that is external, or leaf nodes) exist to essentially collate the information that propagates up from the level below, and then document the results.

### Voting

Once the decision is formulated and agreed upon, it will then be voted on.

Voting is simple within a network. If the votes come from the affinity groups, the leaf nodes, instead of individuals, it will be that much more effective. By using a “group voting” methodology, where the vote is considered in the basic affinity group and only then is propagated into the network, the impacts of personality infringements on the method will be reduced, and also provide some oversight and constraints on the more radical responses. It will also help keep the vote on topic. Using intelligent voting mechanisms, the votes can be more directed and will include more relevant information regarding the issue of concern. The computer can enable these to be registered and collected more effectively.

Due to the availability of record keeping, if there are trends – both negative or positive – they can be more easily identified and tracked before they become conflictual.
As the individual members have been personally verified, there will be no need for identity to be verified by strangers each time a vote is required.

### Effectiveness

Once a decision has been reached, the resources are then organised through the emergence of another tree, which will then be mapped into an organisational structure to deal with the task at hand as efficiently as possible. This subnet, or branch, emerges in the form appropriate to the project. Parts might remain in existence for the duration of the project, while others could morph, or re-arrange and re-emerge, into a similar but different configuration whether of personnel or any other component, for differing stages of the project.

The other is the existence of a group that will oversee the project from cradle to grave, acting as the liaison between the network itself, the particular constituency affected by the project, and the project team. This group monitors the effectiveness of the implementation, and as anyone can also give feedback, there is ongoing monitoring. If the decision is large-scale, there could even be a small tree that would be created to monitor the implementation. This tree could be maintained, and become somewhat institutionalised. This would be an offshoot of the actual project tree.

The records of all decisions, the results thereof, and thus their implementation, will all be on public record and accessible by anyone with a need to know.
If the goal of the project was to complete it as efficiently as possible, instead of the primary goal being financial, and there were minimal distractions beyond the usual ones encountered in any project, the goal of the project as a whole could be achieved more effectively. If the economic pressures that drive these type of projects were minimised – there could be resource constraints, labour constraints, etc. -- the goal of efficiency could be prioritised.

### Resources and Financing

The use and distribution of resources and the finances of the network are to be determined by the participants in the network itself. This is done in the same way as the decision-making process. When a request propagates up the tree, it will at some point become necessary to estimate the financial and other resources necessary to accomplish the task. This will be shared with all concerned, and available to any others interested. Opinions will be recorded and taken into consideration, until it has reached a point of stability, whereupon the process can begin. Thinking in terms of a tree that spans the whole network: if this issue covers a wider domain, these budgets could be adjusted because of the scope of the problem.

The members of the tree support the tree through tithing and commercial trading within the tree, as well as providing services and products, when available. Trading begins in the community, spreads to the network, and then spills over to the rest of the globe, thus increasing the wealth of the network itself, while not reducing the net wealth of its participants.

### Trust and Insight

Trust has to be built up over years of interaction, and if a person, or group, has a hidden/personal agenda, one can only hope to reduce the space in which this may occur and to react swiftly and appropriately.

Transparency is necessary to induce trust. By using a block-chain technology that will record all transactions and events associated with any communication and action on the network, a trail will exist to track probable paths as well as an historical record in the case of investigation.

Any aberrant behaviour will be noticed, as all records have to be agreed upon by the affinity group as well as all of those that were involved in the transaction. This will increase the difficulty of introducing a falsity early in the history of the transaction. There will also be monitoring systems in place that will track for inconsistencies in the collection of records. Something like a spam or spyware filter that “learns” to recognise inconsistent responses.

### Flexibility

Flexibility arises from the fact that the network, while having an “oversight” capability, is essentially a network of communication, not governance. The purpose of the network is to connect the various groups and communities. Besides co-ordination and communication, people will organise themselves in the necessary groups to carry out the required tasks.

### Protection against the Abuse of Power

It is very difficult to protect against abuse of power, particularly if there is someone charismatic enough in the network to be able to persuade large groups of people to behave in a certain fashion.

One method to guard against abuse of power is by dissolve the project trees that emerge to deal with specific issues once the job is complete. Unless it is driven by a hidden agenda, or other hidden influences, there should be no issue or need to continue beyond the initial purpose in the same format. Another is the existence of a group that will oversee the project from cradle to grave, acting as the liaison between the network itself, the particular constituency affected by the project, and the project team.
Another safeguard is the full transparency of all communications and transactions that take place within this project tree. By monitoring trends and patterns much could be gleaned, and some early signs of abuse of power or power ascendency could be spotted and rectified. Rather than squash it – as it obviously arises through an otherwise unexpressed need – a better option would be to redirect the issue in question towards more positive effect.

Undue influence or meddling in the affairs of others is something that can also be recognised early by having all records open to perusal. If trustworthy people are in power/governing, these abuses will not occur. However, any system is only as trustworthy as those who are running it. A “trustless” systems using blockchain technology is one possible solution – and it can easily be applied to the Tree of Life network. If not, there is still transparency, some oversight agencies and their integrity, to rely on – similar to the present day dilemma.

### Accountability

Due to the pervasive and persistent access of records, any person or task can be called to account. This is the most obvious way of executing accountability. With an oversight group, and any individuals or groups who are interested in the outcome or history of any person or project, accountability will be relatively easy to evaluate.
