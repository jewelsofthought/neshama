[NOTE: (12-2021) I have referred to the affinity groups as af-groups - which is not the right name. I propose calling them the _A-groups_. They are after all, the primary concern for the network as a whole.]

### Decision-making

All requirements are first articulated in the leaf groups, the _A-groups_, and percolate from the outer rim where the people live. These requirements are collated and collected in the manner described above. They also propagate inwards to the extent of their domain of influence, and at each level the decision-making process is the same throughout the tree. The decision dialogue is collected and collated domain-wide by propagating inwards through one’s ancestors, and then distributed to all people in the domain. This only includes their domain of interest (which should be a fairly well-described portion of the tree – a sub-tree).

Example: If the discussion is water in Cape Town, it would directly affect Cape Town and surrounds, and the outlying areas somewhat, but would hardly affect the people in Johannesburg, even though there might be a larger demographic that might be interested and concerned. Another example is fracking in a certain area, like the Karoo, which may have garnered the interest of many outside of that particular area. Requests could be more prosaic as well – such as a source of organic flour, or a desire to install solar energy.

The actual process would be far more dynamic. Basically, the various components necessary to deal with the problem would be generated in parallel. They would then interface and interact with the particular governing model that exists in the environment in which the tree is growing. The appropriate parental group would co-ordinate the effort, collecting information from external sources, like organisations, institutions, etc., and combine them with the input from the affinity groups. Then, after re-organising that information, the parent group would send it back down the pipe for voting from the population. After that, the plan (or plans) are implemented by a project-tree. At each stage, any part of the network may collaborate or offer support in some manner. There might even be opportunities for learning from and/or teaching of others.

### Representation/Voting

Straight voting on a ‘yay’ or ‘nay’ resolution will be swift and very easily implemented. The reason for declaring domains is to have some ability to manage spurious input to the process. Everyone could or should have his or her say, but some need to be listened to more carefully than others, depending on their direct involvement and their degree of expertise in the particular problem. I may personally appreciate comment and interaction from someone in Sydney, Australia about our current water crises, but he will not have an actual vote in the decisions that the Cape Town tree makes on its water implementation, though he may have an effective vote. The effectiveness of this vote will depend on his participation in the discussion, and his level of knowledge pertaining to the issue. If there are enough effective votes against an implementation, it might behove the Cape Town group to take a deeper look at what they are considering.

An example could be a referendum. Where the referendum is compiled on a wider level than the af-groups, and then voted upon. First a draft of the referendum is composed. That draft is checked by the descendent group – that is, say it was drafted on the great-grandparent level, then it would be passed down to the 10 grandparent groups for affirmation. Once that cycle is completed, the grandparents pass it down to the parent groups, and the process is repeated until it reaches the af-groups. If it passes all the way down, and is agreed upon, it is then voted upon, af-group by af-group.

### Action/Resolution

A project tree is spawned to deal with the problem, and functions autonomously. It has certain characteristics:

1. Whatever the overall structure, it still contains a “tree” that forms the“civic” connections between all those involved. This is to ensure that everybody in the organisation is represented and has a voice.
2. As the organisation is connected to the network, there will be a “parent group” that will monitor and keep an eye on the organisation on behalf of the network itself – rather like a board of directors in a modern company.
3. The “parent group” will have a tree beneath it that consists of all those who are affected by, and interested in, the project. All those connected will be kept abreast by propagating the information down the original Tree of Life. This is because this parent group will be connected to the parent groups of all the interested members, and these parents will include this topic in their reports back to their specific groups.
4. The leaders and “office” bearers for the project are also designated by the group and will need to be confirmed by those affected (with support from those interested, but not directly impacted).
5. Once the project is complete, the group will disband, unless needed for something else.

### Disputes

Disputes are handled in a similar way in which decisions propagate along the tree. If there is a disagreement within an _affinity group_, then it is incumbent on the group to resolve it. If they are having difficulty, then the sponsors of the those who are in conflict could be brought in, and help mediate the conflict.

If it cannot be resolved in that forum, and the disagreement spans a greater domain than that of the local group &mdash; perhaps about a transaction, an agreement, the interpretation of an agreement, a principle, etc. &mdash; then it will be brought up at the parents’ meeting, and if it is agreed that it is more generic, but local enough to only affect these 10 groups, then it will be up to the the affected (and interested) groups to debate and decide on the outcome.

Once again, those who are closest and most impacted by the outcome, will be given greater weight and relevance than those who are distant.

If it some issue that deals with an even larger domain, it will be brought to the grandparents’ meeting, and follow the same procedure as for the parents. Once again, it is recursive.

### Threads (flow of information)

If it is deemed necessary for certain information/interaction flow to take place along pathways that require swifter response, or have a different geography along which they need to travel, rather than the default tree traversal, it is possible to introduce threads. One could think of them as “shortcuts”, which, as long as they are useful, will be used. However, if something changes, they could then soon disappear.

This introduces another dimension to the Tree, that allows for more expedient and direct communication between the necessary and affected parties.
