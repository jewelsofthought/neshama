## Stage V: Web of trust

As the network grows and needs blossom, a requirement for producers and consumers (roles in an economic model) will arise, for often the consumer and the producer are two aspects of the same person. This is where we create a web of trust. We already have a social web of trust, but this will be an object-orientated web of trust. Although this new web concerns objects, there are many aspects that will influence its life-cycle, and these will need to be trusted and monitored. The network will provide the necessary oversight so that consumers will know that the object is actually what it purports to be, and the claims it makes are true. At this stage, there are many regulations and regulatory bodies in the world in whom we no longer have confidence. By bringing a more personal aspect into the network and this web of trust, we will know, for instance, who is producing organic (non-pesticide) items and who is not. A set of regulations is not sufficient to ensure the integrity of the item. The network will take a more personal approach such as a visit by a member which is surely more valuable than a heap of regulations. All the relevant information will be available via the network.

This is about the consumer being able to trust the producer and supplier. If they subscribe to the same ethos, then the consumer will be less concerned. Checks can and should be done; however the abiding of regulations is onerous for the small scale, or neighbourhood, supplier. Through the personal connections that the network will encourage, these criteria could be assured in a far more pleasant and fruitful manner, while allowing for a more accurate assessment.

Blockchains can be used to enhance this web of trust.

### Non-electronic version

Non-electronic version

In order to consider a global governance system, one needs to take the electronically disenfranchised communities into account. It would actually be preferable to reduce our reliance on a purely electronic forms of governance in general. Thus one would hope for a hybrid between the two. However, the prevalence of cell-phones world-wide has reduced the amount of non-connected people.

A pre-requisite would be for all the people in a community to be physically able to connect. Another requirement would be to have at least one communication device per parent group. If there is none, the network could provide one. Other than that, all the other criteria and methods of connectivity would be the same; perhaps the formation of the network and communication within the network would be slower, though more organic.
There are also some initiatives underway to create a global distributed and robust network that will be more distributed than the current system â€“ almost like a mesh network.
