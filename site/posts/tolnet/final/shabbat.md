## Sabbath

The principle of the Shabbat:

Whatever you do every day, one day of the week, for one day out of seven, you cease to do that. If you work every day, one day a week you do not work. If you smoke every day, Shabbat, you do not smoke. if you drive every day, walk or cycle instead on this day. If you watch TV, every day, switch off your TV, and read a book or go for a walk. If you pray, pray differently. If you meditate in the lotus in a meditation room, perhaps try a walking meditation, or meditate on a flower in your garden.

The only things you do not stop doing are those that you need for life - sleep, drink, eat, oblute (from ablution).

But this is the first stage. What R' Yehuda calls the resting stage. A place to calm the _nefesh_, your soul.

The next stage is more challenging. It requires you to activate your will, and commit. For it is the beginning of the work - now that you are rested.
Here, the goal is to introduce "improvements", now that you have "cleared" space for growth. And the direction in which to grow is upward of course, and that is, to improve what you are doing in your Shabbat space. Seek those things (actions) that nourish your soul, and lift your spirits.

That is why, if you are involved in something uplifting like prayer or meditation, do it differently.

Shabbat is day you give to G-d. To the other, the unknown that has gifted us with this event we call life. Think of it as a tithe of time and space. It is entering into the realm of the possible, which would be impossible in the zero possibility world of the manifest/real. Thus, it does not need to contain the proscribed, except for those who find it easier, and more comfortable to be a passenger. Nor can it contain the frivolous exploration of the perpetually seeking. Each change, each improvement, has to be explored, has to be crested.

In order to receive the gift...
