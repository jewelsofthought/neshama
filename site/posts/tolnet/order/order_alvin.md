## SCIENCE AND CHANGE

> by Alvin Toffler

One of the most highly developed skills in contemporary Western civilization is dissection: the split-up of problems into their smallest possible components. We are good at it. So good, we often forget to put the pieces back together again.

This skill is perhaps most finely honed in science. There we not only routinely break problems down into bite-sized chunks and mini-chunks, we then very often isolate each one from its environment by means of a useful trick. We say _ceteris paribus_&mdash;all other things being equal. In this way we can ignore the complex interactions between our problem and the rest of the universe.

llya Prigogine, who won the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his work on the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium systems , is net satisfied, however, with merely taking things apart. He has spent the better part of a lifetime trying to "put the pieces back together again"-the pieces in this case being biology and physics, necessity and chance, science and humanity. Born in Russia in 1917 and raised in Belgium since the age of ten, Prigogine is a compact man with gray hair, cleanly chiseled features, and a laserlike intensity. Deeply interested in archaeology, art, and history, he brings to science a remarkable polymathic mind. He lives with his engineer-wife, Marina, and his son , Pascal, in Brussels, where a cross-disciplinary team is busy exploring the implications of his ideas in fields as disparate as the social behavior of ant colonies, diffusion reactions in chemical systems and dissipative processes in quantum field theory.

He spends part of each year at the Ilya Prigogine Center for Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics of the University of Texas in Austin. To his evident delight and surprise, he was awarded the NobelÂ· Prize for his work on "dissipative structures" arising out of nonlinear processes in non-equilibrium systems. The coauthor of this volume, Isabelle Stengers, is a philosopher, chemist, and historian of science who served for a time as part of Prigogine's Brussels team. She now lives in Paris and is associated with the Musee de Ia Villette.

In _Order Out of Chaos_ they have given us a landmark&mdash;a work that is contentious and mind-energizing, a book filled with flashing insights that subvert many of our most basic assumptions and suggest fresh ways to think about them. Under the title _La nouvelle alliance_, its appearance in France in 1979 triggered a marvelous scientific free-for-all among prestigious intellectuals in fields as diverse as entomology and literary criticism.

It is a measure of America's insularity and cultural arrogance that this book, which is either published or about to be published in twelve languages, has taken so long to cross the Atlantic. The delay carries with it a silver lining, however, in that this edition includes Prigogine 's newest findings, particularly with respect to the Second Law of thermodynamics, which he sets into a fresh perspective.

For all these reasons, _Order Out of Chaos_ is more than just another book: It is a lever for changing science itself, for compelling us to reexamine its goals, its methods, its epistemology&msdash;its world view. Indeed, this book can serve as a symbol of today's historic transformation in science&mdash;one that no informed person can afford to ignore.

Some scholars picture science as driven by its own internal logic, developing according to its own laws in splendid isolation from the world around it. Yet many scientific hypotheses, theories, metaphors, and models (not to mention the choices made by scientists either to study or to ignore various problems) are shaped by economic, cultural, and political forces operating outside the laboratory.

I do not mean to suggest too neat a parallel between the nature of society and the reigning scientific world view or "paradigm."
Still less would I relegate science to some "superstructure mounted atop a socioeconomic "base," as Marxists are wont to do. But science is not an "independent variable." It is an open
system embedded in society and linked to it by very dense feedback loops. It is powerfully influenced by its external environment, and, in a general way, its development is shaped by cultural receptivity to its dominant ideas.

Take that body of ideas that came together in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries under the heading of "classical science" or "Newtonianism." They pictured a world in which every event was determined by initial conditions that were, at least in principle, determinable with precision. It was a world in which chance played no part, in which all the pieces came together like cogs in a cosmic machine.

The acceptance of this mechanistic view coincided with the rise of a factory civilization. And divine dice-shooting seems hardly enough to account for the fact that the Age of the Machine enthusiastically embraced scientific theories that pictured the entire universe as a machine.

This view of the world led Laplace to his famous claim that, given enough facts, we could not merely predict the future but retrodict the past. And this image of a simple, uniform; mechanical universe not only shaped the development of science, it also spilled over into many other fields. It influenced the framers of the American Constitution to create a machine for governing, its checks and balances clicking like parts of a clock. Metternich, when he rode forth to create his balance of power in Europe, carried a copy of Laplace's writings in his baggage. And the dramatic spread of factory civilization, with its vast clanking machines, its heroic engineering breakthroughs, the rise of the railroad, and new industries such as steel, textile, and auto, seemed merely to confirm the image of the universe as an engineer's Tinkertoy.

Today, however, the Age of the Machine is screeching to a halt, if ages can screech&mdash;and ours certainly seems to. And the decline of the industrial age forces us to confront the painful limitations of the machine model of reality.

Of course, most of these limitations are not freshly discovered. The notion that the world is a clockwork, the planets timelessly orbiting, all systems operating deterministically in equilibrium, all subject to universal laws that an outside observer could discover&mdash;this model has come under withering fire ever since it first arose.

In the early nineteenth century, thermodynamics challenged the timelessness implied in the mechanistic image of the universe . If the world was a big machine, the thermodynamicists declared, it was running down, its useful energy leaking out. It could not go on forever, and time, therefore, took on a new meaning. Darwin's followers soon introduced a contradictory thought: The world-machine might be running down, losing energy and organization, but biological systems, at least, were running up, becoming more, not less, organized.

By the early twentieth century, Einstein had come along to put the observer back into the system: The machine looked different&mdash;indeed, for all practical purposes it was different depending upon where you stood within it. But it was still a deterministic machine, and God did not throw dice. Next, the quantum people and the uncertainty folks attacked the model with pickaxes, sledgehammers, and sticks of dynamite.

Nevertheless, despite all the ifs, ands, and buts, it remains fair to say, as Prigogine and Stengers do, that the machine paradigm is still the "reference point" for physics and the core model of science in general. Indeed, so powerful is its continuing influence that much of social science, and especially
economics, remains under its spell.

The importance of this book is not simply that it uses original arguments to challenge the Newtonian model, but also that it shows how the still valid, though much limited, claims of Newtonianism might fit compatibly into a larger scientific image of reality. It argues that the old "universal laws" are not universal at all, but apply only to local regions of reality. And
these happen to be the regions to which science has devoted the most effort.

Thus, in broad-stroke terms, Prigogine and Stengers argue that traditional science in the Age of the Machine tended to emphasize stability, order, uniformity, and equilibrium. It concerned itself mostly with closed systems and linear relationships in which small inputs uniformly yield small results.

With the transition from an industrial society based on heavy inputs of energy, capital, and labor to a high-technology society in which information and innovation are the critical resources, it is not surprising that new scientific world models should appear.

What makes the Prigoginian paradigm especially interesting is that it shifts attention to those aspects of reality that characterize today's accelerated social change: disorder, instability, diversity, disequilibrium, nonlinear relationships (in which small inputs can trigger massive consequences), and temporality&mdash;a heightened sensitivity to the flows of time.The work of Ilya Prigogine and his colleagues in the so called " Brussels school" may well represent the next revolution in science as it enters into a new dialogue not merely with nature, but with society itself.

---

The ideas of the Brussels school, based heavily on Prigogine's work, add up to a novel, comprehensive theory of change. Summed up and simplified, they hold that while some parts of the universe may operate like machines, these are closed systems,
and closed systems, at best, form only a small part of the physical universe. Most phenomena of interest to us are, in fact, open systems, exchanging energy or matter (and, one might add, information) with their environment. Surely biological and social systems are open, which means that the attempt to understand them
in mechanistic terms is doomed to failure.

This suggests , moreover, that most of reality, instead of being orderly, stable, and equilibrial, is seething and bubbling with change, disorder, and process.

In Prigoginian terms, all systems contain subsystems, which are continually "fluctuating." At times, a single fluctuation or a combination of them may become so powerful, as a result of positive feedback, that it shatters the preexisting organization. At this revolutionary moment&mdash;the authors call it a "singular moment" or a "bifurcation point"&mdash;it is inherently
impossible to determine in advance which direction change will take: whether the system will disintegrate into "chaos" or leap to a new, more differentiated, higher level of "order" or organization, which they call a "dissipative structure." (Such physical or chemical structures are termed dissipative because, compared with the simpler structures they replace , they require more energy to sustain them.)

One of the key controversies surrounding this concept has to do with Prigogine's insistence that order and organization can actually arise "spontaneously" out of disorder and chaos through a process of "self-organization."

To grasp this extremely powerful idea, we first need to make a distinction between systems that are in "equilibrium," systems that are "near equilibrium," and systems that are "far from equilibrium."

Imagine a primitive tribe . If its birthrate and death rate are equal, the size of the population remains stable. Assuming adequate food and other resources, the tribe forms part of a local
system in ecological equilibrium.

Now increase the birthrate. A few additional births (without an equivalent number of deaths) might have little effect. The system may move to a near-equilibrial state. Nothing much happens. It takes a big jolt to produce big consequences in systems that are in equilibria] or near-equilibria] states.

But if the birthrate should suddenly soar, the system is pushed into a far-from-equilibrium condition, and here non-linear relationships prevail. In this state , systems do strange things. They become inordinately sensitive to external influences. Small inputs yield huge, startling effects. The entire system may reorganize itself in ways that strike us as bizarre.

Examples of such self-reorganization abound in _Order Out
of Chaos_. Heat moving evenly through a liquid suddenly, at a certain threshold, converts into a convection current that radically reorganizes the liquid, and millions of molecules, as if on cue, suddenly form themselves into hexagonal cells.

Even more spectacular are the "chemical clocks" described by Prigogine and Stengers. Imagine a million white ping-pong balls mixed at random with a million black ones, bouncing around chaotically in a tank with a glass window in it. Most of the time, the mass seen through the window would appear to be gray, but now and then, at irregular moments, the sample seen through the glass might seem black or white, depending on the distribution of the balls at that moment in the vicinity of the window.

Now imagine that suddenly the window goes all white, then all black, then all white again, and on and on, changing its color completely at fixed intervals-like a clock ticking.

Why do all the white balls and all the black ones suddenly organize themselves to change color in time with one another? By all the traditional rules, this should not happen at all. Yet, if
we leave ping-pong behind and look at molecules in certain chemical reactions, we find that precisely such a self-organization or ordering can and does occur&mdash;despite what classical physics and the probability theories of Boltzmann tell us.

In far-from-equilibrium situations other seemingly spontaneous, often dramatic reorganizations of matter within time and space also take place. And if we begin thinking in terms of two or three dimensions, the number and variety of such possible structures become very great.

Now add to this an additional discovery. Imagine a situation in which a chemical or other reaction produces an enzyme whose presence then encourages further production of the same enzyme. This is an example of what computer scientists would call a positive-feedback loop. In chemistry it is called "auto-catalysis."Such situations are rare in inorganic chemistry. But in recent decades the molecular biologists have found that such loops (along with inhibitory or "negative" feedback and more complicated "cross-catalytic" processes) are the very stuff of life itself. Such processes help explain how we go from little lumps of DNA to complex living organisms. More generally, therefore, in far-from-equilibrium conditions we find that very small perturbations or fluctuations can become amplified into gigantic, structure-breaking waves.

And this sheds light on all sorts of "qualitative" or "revolutionary" change processes. When one combines the new inÂ­
sights gained from studying far-from-equilibrium states and
nonlinear processes, along with these complicated feedback
systems, a whole new approach is opened that makes it possiÂ­
ble to relate the so-called hard sciences to the softer sciences
of life-and perhaps even to social processes as well.
(Such findings have at least analogical significance for soÂ­
cial, economic or political realities. Words like "revolution, "
"economic crash," "technological upheaval ," and "paradigm
shift" all take on new shades of meaning when we begin thinkÂ­
ing of them in terms of fluctuations, feedback amplification,
dissipative structures, bifurcations, and the rest of the PrigogiÂ­
nian conceptual vocabulary.) It is these panoramic vistas that
are opened to us by Order Out of Chaos.
Beyond this, there is the even more puzzling, pervasive isÂ·
sue of time.
Part of today's vast revolution in both science and culture is
a reconsideration of time, and it is important enough to merit a
brief digression here before returning to Prigogine's role in it.
Take history, for example. One of the great contributions to
historiography has been Braudel's division of time into three
scales-" geographical time, " in which events occur over theORDER OUT OF CHAOS
xviii
course of aeons ; the much shorter "social time" scale by
which economies, states, and civilizations are measured; and
the even shorter scale of "individual time"-the history of
human events.
In social science, time remains a largely unmapped terrain.
Anthropology has taught us that cultures differ sharply in the
way they conceive of time. For some, time is cyclical-history
endlessly recurrent. For other cultures, our own included,
time is a highway stretched between past and future, and peoÂ­
ple or whole societies march along it. In still other cultures,
human lives are seen as stationary in time ; the future advances
toward us, instead of us toward it.
Each society, as I've written elsewhere, betrays its own
characteristic "time bias"-the degree to which it places emÂ­
phasis on past, present, or future. One lives in the past. AnÂ­
other may be obsessed with the future.
Moreover, each culture and each person tends to think in
terms of "time horizons . " Some of us think only of the immeÂ­
diate-the now. Politicians, for example, are often criticized
for seeking only immediate, short-term results. Their time
horizon is said to be influenced by the date of the next elecÂ­
tion. Others among us plan for the long term. These differing
time horizons are an overlooked source of social and political
friction-perhaps among the most important.
B ut despite the growing recognition that cultural conÂ­
ceptions of time differ, the social sciences have developed little
in the way of a coherent theory of time. Such a theory might
reach across many disciplines, from politics to group dynamÂ­
ics and interpersonal psychology. It might, for example, take
account of what, in Future Shock, I called "durational expecÂ­
tancies"-our culturally induced assumptions about how long
certain processes are supposed to take.
We learn very early, for example, that brushing one's teeth
should last only a few minutes, not an entire morning, or that
when Daddy leaves for work, he is likely to be gone approxÂ­
imately eight hours, or that a "mealtime" may last a few minÂ­
utes or hours, but never a year. (Television, with its division of
the day into fixed thirty- or sixty-minute intervals , subtly
shapes our notions of duration. Thus we normally expect the
hero in a melodrama to get the girl or find the money or win
the war in the last five minutes. In the United States we expectxix
FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE
commercials to break in at certain intervals.) Our minds are
filled with such durational assumptions. Those of children are
much different from those of fully socialized adults, and here
again the differences are a source of conflict.
Moreover, ch ildren in an industrial society are " time
trained"-they learn to read the clock, and they learn to disÂ­
tinguish even quite small slices of time, as when their parents
tell them, "You've only got three more minutes till bedtime!"
These s harply honed temporal skills are often absent in
slower-moving agrarian societies that require less precision in
daily scheduling than our time-obsessed society.
Such concepts , which fit within the social and individual
time scales of B raude!, have never been systematically deÂ­
veloped in the social sciences. Nor have they, in any signifiÂ­
cant way, been articulated with our scientific theories of time,
even though they are necessarily connected with our assumpÂ­
tions about physical reality. And this brings us back to PriÂ­
gogine, who has been fascinated by the concept of time since
boyhood. He once said to me that, as a young student, he was
struck by a grand contradiction in the way science viewed
time, and this contradiction has been the source of his life's
work ever since.
In the world model constructed by Newton and his folÂ­
lowers , time was an afterthought. A moment, whether in the
present, past, or future, was assumed to be exactly like any
other moment. The endless cycling of the planets-indeed,
the operations of a clock or a simple machine-can, in princiÂ­
ple , go either backward or forward in time without altering the
basics of the system. For this reason, scientists refer to time in
Newtonian systems as "reversible . "
In the nineteenth century, however, a s the main focus of
physics shifted from dynamics to thermodynamics and the
Second Law of thermodynamics was proclaimed, time sudÂ­
denly became a central concern. For, according to the Second
Law, there is an inescapable loss of energy in the universe.
And , if the world machine is really running down and apÂ­
proaching the heat death, then it follows that one moment is no
longer exactly like the last. You cannot run the universe backÂ­
ward to make up for entropy. Events over the long term cannot
replay themselve s . A nd this means that there is a direcÂ­
tionality or, as Eddington later called it, an "arrow" in time.ORDER OUT OF CHAOS
xx
The whole universe is, in fact, aging. And, in turn, if this is
true, time is a one-way street. It is no longer reversible, but
irreversible.
In short, with the rise of thermodynamics, science split
down the middle with respect to time. Worse yet, even those
who saw time as irreversible soon also split into two camps.
After all, as energy leaked out of the system, its ability to
sustain organized structures weakened , and these, in turn,
broke down into less organized, hence more random eleÂ­
ments. But it is precisely organization that gives any system
internal diversity. Hence, as entropy drained the system of enÂ­
ergy, it also reduced the differences in it. Thus the Second
Law pointed toward an increasingly homogeneous-and, from
the human point of view, pessimistic-future.
Imagine the problems introduced by Darwin and his folÂ­
lowers! For evolution, far from pointing toward reduced organÂ­
ization and d iversity, points i n the opposite direction.
Evolution proceeds from simple to complex, from "lower" to
"higher" forms of life, from undifferentiated to differentiated
structures. And, from a human point of view, all this is quite
optimistic. The universe gets "better" organized as it ages,
continually advancing to a higher level as time sweeps by.
In this sense, scientific views of time may be summed up as
a contradiction within a contradiction.
It is these paradoxes that Prigogine and Stengers set out to
illuminate, asking, "What is the specific structure of dynamic
systems which permits them to 'distinguish' between past and
future? What is the minimum complexity involved?"
The answer, for them , is that time makes its appearance
with randomness: "Only when a system behaves in a suffiÂ­
ciently random way may the difference between past and fuÂ­
ture, and therefore irreversibility, enter its description. "
I n classical or mechanistic science, events begin with "iniÂ­
tial conditions , " and their atoms or particles follow "world
lines" or trajectories. These can be traced either backward
into the past or forward into the future. This is just the opÂ­
posite of certain chemical reactions, for example, in which two
liquids poured into the same pot diffuse until the mixture is
uniform or homogeneous . These liquids do not de-diffuse
themselves. At each moment of time the mixture is different,
the entire process is "time-oriented. "
For classical science, at least i n its early stages, such pro-xxi
FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE
cesses were regarded as anomalies, peculiarities that arose
from highly unlikely initial conditions.
It is Prigogine and Stengers' thesis that such time-depenÂ­
dent, one-way processes are not merely aberrations or deviaÂ­
tions from a world in which time is irreversible. If anything,
the opposite might be true, and it is reversible time, associated
with "closed systems" (if such , indeed, exist in reality), that
may well be the rare or aberrant phenomenon.
What is more , irreversible processes are the source of
order-hence the title Order Out of Chaos. It is the processes
associated with randomness, openness, that lead to higher levÂ­
els of organization, such as dissipative structures.
Indeed, one of the key themes of this book is its striking
reinterpretation of the Second Law of thermodynamics. For
according to the authors, entropy is not merely a downward
slide toward disorganization. Under certain conditions, enÂ­
tropy itself becomes the progenitor of order.
What the authors are proposing, therefore, is a vast synÂ­
thesis that embraces both reversible and irreversible time, and
shows how they relate to one another, not merely at the level of
macroscopic phenomena, but at the most minute level as well.
It is a breathtaking attempt at "putting the pieces back toÂ­
gether again. " The argument is complex, and at times beyond
easy reach of the lay reader. But it flashes with fresh insight
and suggests a coherent way to relate seemingl y unconÂ­
nected-even contradictory-philosophical concepts.
Here we begin to glimpse, in full richness, the monumental
synthesis proposed in these pages. By insisting that irreversÂ­
ible time is not a mere aberration, but a characteristic of much
of the universe, they subvert classical dynamics. For PriÂ­
gogine and Stengers, it is not a case of either/or. Of course,
reversibility still applies (at least for sufficiently long times)Â­
but in closed systems only. Irreversibility applies to the rest of
the universe.
Prigogine and Stengers also undermine conventional views
of thermodynamics by showing that, under nonequilibrium
conditions , at least , entropy may produce , rather than deÂ­
grade, order, organization-and therefore life .
I f this i s so, then entropy, too, loses its ei ther /o r character.
Whi l e certai n systems run down , other s ystems simulÂ­
taneously evolve and grow more coherent. This mutualistic,ORDER OUT OF CHAOS
xxii
nonexclusive view makes it possible for biology and physics to
coexist rather than merely contradict one another.
Finally, yet another profound synthesis is implied-a new
relationship between chance and necessity.
The role of happenstance in the affairs of the universe has
been debated, no doubt, since the first Paleolithic warrior acÂ­
cidently tripped over a rock. In the Old Testament, God's will
is sovereign, and He not only controls the orbiting planets but
manipulates the will of each and every individual as He sees
fit. As Prime Mover, al l causality flows from Him, and all
events in the universe are foreordained. Sanguinary conflicts
raged over the precise meaning of predestination or free will,
from the time of Augustine through the Carolingian quarrels.
Wycliffe, Huss, Luther, Calvin-all contributed to the debate.
No end of interpreters attempted to reconcile determinism
with freedom of will. One ingenious view held that God did
indeed determine the affairs of the universe, but that with reÂ­
spect to the free will of the individual, He never demanded a
specific action. He merely preset the range of options availÂ­
able to the human decision-maker. Free will downstairs operÂ­
ated only within the limits of a menu determined upstairs.
In the secular culture of the Machine Age, hard-line deterÂ­
minism has more or less held sway even after the challenges of
Heisenberg and the "uncertaintists. " Even today, thinkers
such as Rene Thorn reject the idea of chance as illusory and
inherently unscientific.
Faced with such philosophical stonewalling, some defenders
of free will, spontaneity, and ultimate u ncertainty, especially
the existentialists, have taken equally uncompromising stands.
(For Sartre, the human being was "completely and always
free, " though even Sartre, in certain writings, recognized
practical limitations on this freedom.)
Two things seem to be happening to contemporary concepts
of chance and determinism. To begin with, they are becoming
more complex. As Edgar Morin, a leading French sociologistÂ­
turned-epistemologist, has written:
" Let us not forget that the problem of determinism has
changed over the course of a century . . . . In place of the idea
of sovereign, anonymous, permanent laws directing all things
in nature there has been substituted the idea of laws of interacÂ­
tion . . . . There is more: the problem of determinism has be-xxiii
FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE
come that of the order of the universe. Order means that there
are other things besides 'Jaws' : that there are constraints, inÂ­
variances, constancies, regularities in our universe . . . . In
place of the homogenizing and anonymous view of the old deÂ­
terminism, there has been substituted a diversifying and evoÂ­
lutive view of determinations."
And as the concept of determinism has grown richer, new
efforts have been made to recognize the co-presence of both
chance and necessity, not with one subordinate to theÂ· other,
but as full partners in a universe that is simultaneously
organizing and de-organizing itself.
It is here that Prigogine and Stengers enter the arena. For they
have taken the argument a step farther. They not only demonstrate
(persuasively to me, though not to critics like the mathematician,
Rene Thorn) that both determinism and chance operate, they also
attempt to show how the two fit together.
Thus, according to the theory of change implied in the idea
of dissipative structures, when fluctuations force an existing
system into a far-from-equilibrium condition and threaten its
structure, it approaches a critical moment or bifurcation point.
At this point, according to the authors, it is inherently imposÂ­
sible to determine in advance the next state of the system.
Chance nudges what remains of the system down a new path
of development. And once that path is chosen (from among
many), determinism takes over again until the next bifurcation
point is reached.
Here, in short, we see chance and necessity not as irreconcilÂ­
able opposites, but each playing its role as a partner in destiny.
Yet another synthesis is achieved.
When we bring reversible time and irreversible time , disorÂ­
der and order, physics and biology, chance and necessity all
into the same novel frame, and stipulate their interrelationÂ­
ships, we have made a grand statement-arguable, no doubt,
but in this case both powerful and majestic.
Yet this accounts only in part for the excitement occasioned
by Order Out of Chaos. For this sweeping synthesis, as I have
suggested, has strong social and even political overtones . Just
as the Newtonian model gave rise to analogies in politics, diÂ­
plomacy, and other spheres seemingly remote from science,
so, too, does the Prigoginian model lend itself to analogical
extension.ORDER OUT OF CHAOSÂ·
xxfv
By offering rigorous ways of modeling qualitative change,
for example, they shed light on the concept of revolution. By
explaining how successive instabilities give rise to transformaÂ­
tory change, they illuminate organization theory. They throw a
fresh light, as well, on certain psychological processes-innoÂ­
vation, for example, which the authors see as associated with
" nonaverage" behavior of the kind that arises under nonequiÂ­
librium conditions.
Even more significant, perhaps, are the implications for the
study of collective behavior. Prigogine and Stengers caution
against leaping to genetic or sociobiological explanations for
puzzling social behavior. Many things that are attributed to
biological pre-wiring are not produced by selfish, determinist
genes, but rather by social interactions under nonequilibrium
conditions.
(In one recent study, for instance, ants were divided into
two categories: One consisted of hard workers, the other of
inactive or " lazy" ants. One might overhastily trace such
traits to genetic predisposition. Yet the study found that if the
system were shattered by separating the two groups from one
another, each in turn developed its own subgroups of hard
workers and idlers. A significant percentage of the "lazy" ants
suddenly turned into hardworking Stakhanovites.)
Not surprisingly, therefore, the ideas behind this remarkable
book are beginning to be researched in economics , urban
studies, human geography, ecology, and many other disciÂ­
plines.
No one-not even its authors-can appreciate the full imÂ­
plications of a work as crowded with ideas as Order Out of
Chaos. Each reader will no doubt come away puzzled by some
passages (a few are simply too technical for the reader without
scientific training); startled or stimulated by others (as their
implications strike home) ; occasionally skeptical; yet intellecÂ­
tually enriched by the whole. And if one measure of a book is
the degree to which it generates good questions, this one is
surely successful.
Here are just a couple that have haunted me.
How, outside a laboratory, might one define a .. fluctuaÂ­
tion"? What, in Prigoginian t e r m s, does one mean by â¢â¢cause"
or "effect"? And when the authors speak of molecules comÂ­
municating with one another to achieve coherent, synchro-xxv
FOREWORD: SCIENCE AND CHANGE
nized change, one may assume they are not anthropomorphizÂ·
ing. But they raise for me a host of intriguing issues about
whether all parts of the environment are signaling all the time,
or only intermittently ; about the indirect, second , and nth
order communication that takes place, permitting a molecule
or an organism to respond to signals which it cannot sense for
lack of the necessary receptors. (A signal sent by the environÂ­
ment that is undetectable by A may be received by B and conÂ­
verted into a different kind of signal that A is properly
equipped to receive-so that B serves as a relay/converter,
and A responds to an environmental change that has been sigÂ­
naled to it via second-order communication.)
In connection with time, what do the authors make of the
idea put forward by Harvard astronomer David Layzer, that
we might conceive of three distinct "arrows of time"-one
based on the continued expansion of the universe since the Big
Bang; one based on entropy; and one based on biological and
historical evolution?
Another question: How revolutionary was the Newtonian
revolution? Taking issue with some historians, Prigogine and
Stengers point out the continuity of Newton's ideas with alÂ­
chemy and religious notions of even earlier vintage . Some
readers might conclude from this that the rise of NewtoniÂ­
anism was neither abrupt nor revolutionary. Yet, to my mind ,
the Newtonian breakthrough should not be seen as a linear
outgrowth of these earlier ideas. Indeed, it seems to me that
the theory of change developed in Order Out of Chaos argues
against just such a "continuist" view.
Even if Newtonianism was derivative, this doesn't mean
that the intc;:rnal structure of the Newtonian world-model was
actually the same or that it stood in the same relationship to its
external environment.
The Newtonian system arose at a time when feudalism in
Western Europe was crumbling-when the social system was ,
s o to speak, far from equilibrium. The model of the universe
proposed by the classical scientists (even if partially derivaÂ­
tive) was applied analogously to new fields and disseminated
successfully, not just because of its scientific power or "rightÂ­
ness," but also because an emergent industrial society based
on revolutionary principles provided a particularly receptive
environment for it.
As suggested earlier, machine civilization, in searching forORDER OUT OF CHAOS
.xxvi
an explanation of itself in the cosmic order of things, seized
upon the Newtonian model and rewarded those who further
developed it. It is not only in chemical beakers that we find
auto-catalysis, as the authors would be the first to contend.
For these reasons, it still makes sense to me to regard the
Newtonian knowledge system as, itself, a "cultural dissipative
structure" born of social fluctuation.
Ironically, as I've said, I believe their own ideas are central
to the latest revolution in science, and I cannot help but see
these ideas in relationship to the demise of the Machine Age
and the rise of what I have called a "Third Wave" civilization.
Applying their own terminology, we might characterize toÂ­
day's breakdown of industrial or "Second Wave" society as a
civilizational "bifurcation, " and the rise of a more differentiÂ­
ated, "Third Wave" society as a leap to a new "dissipative
structure" on a world scale. And if we accept this analogy,
might we not look upon the leap from Newtonianism to PriÂ­
goginianism in the same way? Mere analogy, no doubt. But
illuminating, nevertheless.
Finally, we come once more to the ever-challenging issue of
chance and necessity. For if Prigogine and Stengers are right
and chance plays its role at or near the point of bifurcation,
after which deterministic processes take over once more until
the next bifurcation, are they not embedding chance, itself,
within a deterministic framework? By assigning a particular
role to chance, don't they de-chance it?
This question , however, I had the pleasure of discussing
with Prigogine , who smiled over dinner and replied, " Yes.
That would be true. But, of course, we can never determine
when the next bifurcation will arise. " Chance rises phoenixÂ­
like once more.
Order out of Chaos is a brilliant, demanding, dazzling bookÂ­
challenging for all and richly rewarding for the attentive reader. It
is a book to study, to savor, to reread-and to question yet again. It
places science and humanity back in a world in which ceteris
paribus is a myth-a world in which other things are seldom held
steady, equal, or unchanging. In short, it projects science into
today's revolutionary world of instability, disequilibrium, and turÂ­
bulence. In so doing, it serves the highest creative function-it
helps us create fresh order.
