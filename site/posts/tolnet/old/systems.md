## Systems

All dynamic/moving systems are alive. If a system never changes, then it is dead. If a food can stand open for a long time, then it is dead. All static, absolute, unmoving systems are dead. Thus sterilized systems or pasteurised food stuffs are often life depleting. Though there is must support and nourishment that a dead tree or animal provides the living creature of the forest.
