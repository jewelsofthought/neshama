## Virtual Reality

### The fantasy world

The fantasy world is a world of endless fascination, a world in which you could potentially fill all your desires. In that virtual reality you can project any persona you like, be multiple personalities, engaged in all sorts of social interactions – virtual for the most part, of course.

### Earthers & Utopia

Yes, the Earthers might decry this situation, where most of the world spends the majority of their time plugged into another reality (or realities), whatever tasks they are doing in the world of matter. These Earthers might sing the praises of a earthly lifestyle, where one grows ones own food, and eats the food that comes straight off the land, fresh and organic – while the rest of the world eat processed foods, synthesised and manufactured in human laboratories, as effective as that might ultimately be. Some even say it might be healthier – cleaner, more trustworthy as to the nutrient values, not subject to the vicissitudes of a fickle G-d. That we need to exercise regularly and breathe fresh air, swim in the ocean waters, walk amongst real trees.

But what if you could be sitting in your comfortable chair and in your mind, be walking amongst the trees. You can smell the fresh pines and oaks, hear the birds chirping. Then stop off to take a swim in the river – knowing it was clean and safe. And you can experience all of this from that special chair in your living room, or lying on your comfortable, personally adapted, mattress – next to your loved one(s). Or you could decide to visit Paris and walk in the Louvre, with no one else around you could spend your afternoon gazing at the Mona Lisa – no crowds, no noise, just you and her. And if you wanted to, you could at the same time get close-ups of the painting, hear its history, or discuss painting techniques with the artist or others.

Is that not the utopia we have always dreamed of? And now that we are on the precipice of this dream, we are baulking and saying that the price is too steep. But hear me, Earthers, you cannot stop the river of life from flowing along its path.

Utopians have dreamed of a world without hunger and poverty. A world in which people live together in harmony, and work out disagreements and problems in a non-violent manner. Where everyone has access to the basic resources they need to live a decent life. Education is free and available to all. All the books and information (except for certain particularly harmful items) is available, subject to requester’s qualities.

### Present future

But have we ever thought about what that would look like with seven billion, 7,000,000,000 people on the planet – and growing every year exponentially? How much energy it would take to power that many people? What enormous amounts of food and water it would take to feed them? Or the amount of construction it takes to house them, especially if the majority have two places of abode – work and home. And let us not even touch on the amount of waste that is produced in the support and maintenance of this huge population of people. Include in this services, utilities, etc, etc... and we have a huge complicated mixture global and local systems of governance, trade, information, banking, etc. vying and competing to survive, cooperating for the most part, reluctantly.

In fact the figures very quickly become mind boggling. If the average use of water is one litre per day, we use seven billion litres of water a day. There is not a dam in the world that can hold anything close to that. [more specific info?]. And we know that the average is probably larger than that, even if its distribution is extremely skewed, and that the excess usage in many countries is, thank God, balanced by the under usage, one could say starvation, of the less fortunate majority.

So what if the future looks kind of dystopian? As long as we are not warring and killing and hurting and lying to one another as we are doing now. As long as people are no longer pretending to be someone else, and seek to express their authenticity, even if it is in the virtual world. Isn’t that what is most important? For the evil is not in the technology but in the hearts and minds of people.

For instance, would it not be wonderful for a child to explore those fantasies and dreams that he has in a facilitated virtual reality environment? He could experience things that he would never have been able to experience, and might never experience again.

### Addiction & APS

Yes, there is the danger of addiction, of anti-social behaviour, etc. etc. etc. But perhaps there will be enough to occupy the potential addict, perhaps we will have been thoughtful enough to place safeguards. Or perhaps that person’s soul journey is one of addiction. Perhaps the AI/cybercontract1 mechanism would be able to monitor such occurrences, and then there must be human/AI interaction with the affected youngster.

But with APS – all pervading surveillance, how could one hide an addiction, especially of the sort that requires a connection to this virtual realm? What possibilities for crime here – just like smuggling people across countries when the world was caught up in national fever. And how to determine between an addiction and a healthy focus with concentration upon a certain topic or project.

We could design it, build it, develop it, test it – and even run projections and collect information on its effect on other parts of the system. Then we could transition the project into the real world slowly, with checks and balances in place.

[Addiction: those who become addicted. Don’t want to leave. Perhaps there is a place for them.

### Earn time in Cyberworld.

In a world where all you basic necessities are taken care of, then what would one work for? But could this not result in the same situation? If you have lots of credits, you can afford to spend a huge amount of time in cyberspace. But if you are earning credits, why would you waste your time in fantasy land?

Plus there is the problem of a huge population that will have nothing to do, and nothing to incentivise them, that could turn very restive. There was only one solution – provide a living, and let them play in fantasy land.

Could there be a way of earning credits in fantasy spaces? Of course there are. [Later – discussion of earning possibilities]

### Fantasy land

In fantasy land you can create any life you want. You can spend the evenings with your family and children, and then during the day, enter the fantasy land, where you can live any life you desire. You could be an engineer, building in outer-space, or an explorer of unknown realms. You could be an emperor in a far away land, with a harem and spend your days in erotic bliss... but that then become an addiction, and nothing will come of that. We cannot live in that empty limbo for long without causing ourselves inner damage. Thus it will need to be incentivised – for instance, an emperor might have to defend his empire. Just like the hackers of today, would there not be those who might steal or even peddle your erotic fantasy, one that you might have spent years building up and perfecting?

It is similar to what is happening in the global financial system today. Where money has become more important than the actual item it represents. And where huge amounts of money are made and traded in the realm of money – an artificial, one could say, virtual realm. The realm of derivatives, loans, interest, etc.

Everyone would be able to express his or her deepest dreams and fantasies, while all the rest was being taken care of by an AI/MI/cybercontract society. The price would be that it would know everything about you – what you did, every conversation, and now, every desire. However, there would be no incentive, as there is today, to exploit this information to get money out of you – this would and might only take place in the virtual world – and only those that allowed that. Invitations to participate in new worlds, projects, ideas and research.

This would be closer to utopia than we have ever become. We may have found a wonderful solution to what ails us.
How real, and how fantastic, do you want your fantasy to be. You could participate in things with real avatars – avatars that represent real people, even though they might have taken on another persona. A man might offer himself up as a women, and then have sex with many “men”, whose avatars have remained bound to the same sex. One could even be having sex with alien “beings” - who are avatars of real people. As opposed to fantasy avatars that you (or your group) might have created from your imagination, and your narrative unfolds between you and these avatars. A type of 4th generation solitaire. Or playing chess with yourself – except that you can interface with a AI or intelligent andriods to create surprises and interesting twists. Of course you can decide what level of control you will have over the project. Finally, we have the hybrids.
