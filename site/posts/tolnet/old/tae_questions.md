# Tree of Life Network (ToLNET) TAE

## New Paradigm

The new paradigm’s lack of rootedness requires a system of communication and organisation which will enable it to embed itself in the current reality, in order to implement the necessary dynamics for a better future to emerge.

Sage: "Only purpose (evolution) is to evolve into a better version of your previous self"

I hear much talk of the coming paradigm shift, and am a believer myself in the necessity of such a shift. I have heard many versions of what this shift will look like, what it will be, where it comes from and perhaps even to what it is to become.

[Piece on “new paradigm” vs. “current paradigm”.](paradigm_shift.html) Includes "process philosophy".

## Agenda of Change

- How: Strategy: How are we going to bring about this transition?
  Consciousness shift. From static, absolute, empirical view of objects that are time-invariant, to looking at events that are constantly becoming. That is, trying to find a local balance, or dynamic harmony within the greater system, and the local system. From a view of the universe that is static and absolutist, to one that is fluid, dynamic and relative.
- How: Implementation: What are the steps necessary to implement to shift from this paradigm to that “new” paradigm?
  Instead of creating, perhaps we need to learn as a society, a nation and a community to practice constraint.
  In any relationship of sharing there is a giver and a taker. One could say a loser and a winner. That is how energy flows. If the recipient uses all the energy to produce or maintain something productive, all and good. Waste is energy that is not utilised. If he hoards the energy, then it is not being used, and becomes toxic - for he will be collecting "waste" energy. If he (the recipient) has used his energy well, he will have regained his strength, and will be able now to become a giver... That is how the circles are completed.
- What: Design: What structures that will support that?
  Any structures that are built primarily around Truth.
  That are supported by co-operation. That the planning is done by those who are the best people for the job.
- Why: Motivation: How will we embed our vision of a new world in the current reality that we live in?
  If it is the expression of the Oneness of everything, and everything that we are able to perceive and communicate with is respectfully dealt with - we will find the road to bliss.
- Why: Vision: How do we root this idea in the world?
  Prayer, meditation, clear thinking, knowing that Truth is our sword.

  > "You may ask me often, what is this Truth that you speak of? You talk of it as if it is some sort of absolute. We all know that truth is relative, especially in a fluid universe. Tell us of this Truth."

  > This Truth that I speak of is also not static, yet it holds a position, and is measured by its distance from what is **really** happening - something we can never be truly aware of. This is because we firstly only see a small segment of the totality of any event, and secondly, because we can only perceive & comprehend an event after it has occurred and if we have the appropriate means of measuring the change so as to be able to register said event.

  > It expresses itself too subsequent to the event itself. For there is the event itself, which cannot be discussed in relation to its truth or falsity, for it is simply the event. That is the "reality" of the occurrence. It is only subsequent to that, in the imaginarium of our minds, that we begin to cohere what had just occurred. As time passes, that memory, also fluid, is influenced by some of the factors that arise subsequently. Yet as it morphs, to the narrator it is still the sworn truth - as far as he or she is concerned, and there is little that will dissuade said person.

  > So, if we measure outcomes, the truth will always triumph in the end. Although slow, each one of her steps are true! Whereas lies flit around like a butterfly on cocaine, always seek peace, but never finding a place to rest, for it has to constantly feed and maintain the lie(s), and if it ceases for one moment, all the lies will come tumbling down like a house of cards. It has no source of its own, except the truth, that is its nemisis, and it will use her to its advantage if it can. Thus, of utmost importance, is to be able to discern between truth and lies.

  > But how can one do that if one very parents lie. If one's teachers and leaders lie. Where is truth hiding?

  > Brother, and sister, friend and foe, know that truth is never hidden. As we say, she hides in plain sight. For the event is the event, and the truth of the event stands as straight and firm as the shortest line between any two points. Everything else is an approximation, and the closest approximation, the truest rendition of the event itself, will, in the long run, always triumph.

  > Unless, of course, lies plays dirty - which one should always except from some low-life like that. It is the name of his game. And of course, we, even if we are truthsayers, need him, to always keep us clear of the distinction, so that we can better hone our ability to discern the actual Truth.

  > Remember one simple truth, and that is lies cannot hide the truth. They can only blind us to the truth, by causing us to look at what they are presenting - generally with more pazaz and glitter, more noise and impact. We are so like children.

## Vision: A web of communities

Collectives of co-operation, clusters of affinity groups, like mycelium - feeding, supporting, using... a communications, transport and information network.

I have named it “The Tree of Life Network”. It is essentially a collection of [communities](sustainable.html) made up of like-minded people. A place where those who feel a deep mistrust of the current structure can gather, and begin to design & build the society that we imagine, while being supported by a vast network co-ordinating and communicating the efforts of all these cultural creatives.

To change oneself is the most difficult battle, to change a community is multiples more difficult. We need to evolve into a better system of social governance and trade relations, and can no longer be reliant on the present system. The only way to do that is to fashion a more effective system, one that better represents the reality of our global societies, not to waste our energy fighting "for" the current system.

We are not here to convince you of anything, or to change your mind. We are not going to sing pretty songs to seduce you to follow our path. I say, either you know the truth, and are waiting to hear the call. What is commonly known as the call to freedom - "Let my people go". But the only freedom we have is who/what we wish to serve - unless we have encountered the evil force which allows no choice, only obedience and fear.

> Bible: Tale of exodus started of with a request for the community to go into the wilderness for 3 days to pray. Today, we exist in a situation where the pharaoh is refusing to allow us to gather and pray - not in our homes, nor our temples, not even in the wilderness are we allowed to gather in prayer any longer in many places in the world.

If there exists another way, we have to manifest it - not just dream of it, not just speak of it. The question is, how do we do that?

Up till now we have sought the One, the enlightened prophet, who will lead us to the Holy Land.

> Bible: Tale of exodus did not start off with a community seeking their Holy Land. They were not driven by a vision of living a "better" life - just of being free from the bondage of their overlords. Moses did not speak to the people, inspiring them with a vision of life in a Holy Land flowing with milk and honey. No - he spoke to the pharaoh! Only once they had been released from the bondage of the Pharaoh, and he was defeated, did they arrive at Sinai to receive the Torah. Like sheep whose gate some angel had opened, they rushed out of their paddock, not caring nor knowing where they were going. Thank G-d, their prophet led them to Sinai and the Torah. They had been chosen. How many of them even knew this?

> Bible cont: It was surely a shock for most, to be suddenly put upon by thunder and lightening, and then told they are Chosen, and need to obey!

> Is it any different nowadays? Has it changed? How many would readily leave their bondage to ascend on a journey into the wilderness? There was no vision that led the people out of Egypt, but perhaps they were driven by desperation - they, in essence, had little other hope for anything to ever improve. Is that not often the Sophie's Choice of members of any society? Either submit to the current regime and obey, benefiting from its boons, and accepting the yokes of its authority? Is that not how all groupings work - whether physical, or social, or cultural? And when it starts becoming extreme, and more authoritarian, and filled with fear and threats and betrayals and violence, what choice do you have?

> Know the current system will not readily assent to that change. It will seem like the invasion of a foreign body, or that something foreign/uncomfortable is growing within it. It will try and absorb it, and if not then isolate it until it can destroy or remove it. Thus, essentially, it is not us that are pockets of resistance, but the system that is resisting us.

We, the people, have to pull ourselves out of this mess. In order not to fall into another version of the same theme, however, we need to dream, sing & pray, and build together.

These communities are connected by affinities, forming a connected web. Within that network, we begin to co-ordinate, regulate, and maintain local, distributed networks, experimenting, exploring and building _alternatives_ to the current way of interacting and transacting.

> This is what the Jihadist movements offer the people - an alternative way of life. Not that most of them want the to live under repressive Islamic regimes, but they prefer that to the Christian, capatalist way of life. The freedoms that the Western Civilizations offer, are less appealing than the constraints that the Islamic way of life imposes. In the West, we would of course believe that it is imposed on them by the authorotarian patriarchal adherents to the religion, but that is convenient and fits into the correct narrative - from the perspective of the Western mind. However, by the same token, the Islamic adherents could respond with the same analysis of what is occurring in what believes it is the "freest country in the world, a beacon of freedom to all the oppressed of the world", the USA.

The beauty of this present time is that we don’t have to design it – it already exists and is widely manifest in all the big IT arena [Google, FB, etc](cloud.html) - what we call the Cloud - we just have to adapt it to our use. The technology would be the same technology. It is just those who wield it whose [intentions and goals](finite_games.html) will be different.

What I will mention, is that the web is formed from the people who are members of the [network](networks.html). It can manifest any structure of connectivity that they wish to.

Two examples of this are the internet and the net of Indra.

- The internet consists of a vast collection of objects (computers) that are all connected via a complex set of protocols and lines of communication. It does not restrict whatever structure wishes to appear, for it forms an underlying web of connectivity that can be activated along lines chosen by the people themselves.

- The net of Indra is a vision of living spirits that comes from ancient Hindu texts. It speaks of our existences as jewels that sit in a vast network of light. And at certain points of intersection on this vast interconnected web, where there is enough energy, appear the jewels of existence.

## Concept

What do I know about this concept?

1. Alternative:
   That non-hierarchical communication structures are viable and effective (eg: web), but that there is a need for other type of structures too.
   There is a work that has been done to devise various methods of analysing & organising such relationship graphs into various structures to facilitate connectivity. There are also particularly effective ways of ordering these connections to facilitate the spread of information and a fuller expression of the relationships existant and in potentia between the participants.
2. Desire:
   There is a huge desire amongst all peoples to be engaging in communities of trust and support.
3. Will/Commitment:
   Is there sufficient will?
4. Complexity:
   That there is a critical mass, a point at which people will be able to see and understand the concept.[complex systems](systems.html). Until then, it will require faith and commitment from all its members.
5. Economics:
   As a tree requires sap to live, so this tree will require currency - to evaluate interactions - that are the sap of our lives, and to flourish.
6. Network structure:
   A form of this structure exists in almost all organisations. As a graph, it is a generalisation of all organisational structure - similar to a [wave](/qkab/waves.md). What I wish to create is the structure on which this can express itself. This is, in fact, just an example of the way all social movements and in fact, all effective social constructs have organised themselves throughout the ages. All brotherhoods, guilds and ruling elites.
7. Benefits/SpinOffs:
   Once the network manifests, there will be many spin-offs - just as we saw with the internet, and its spawn, the Web. It is about clearing and prepping the ground for the seeds to be planted, creating fertile ground for other expressions of the paradigm shift to emerge. It will be a space for projects, structures and applications.
8. Organic:
   Natural structures - [affinity groups](affinity_groups.html) - emerge organically from this network structure, as groups that share an affinity to something, or some idea, or some expression - whether religious, creative, or other. These groups would cluster, as affinity groups, organised by purpose, creating networks woven within networks. This is an expression of the multi-dimensional/multi-layered aspects of our very existence.
   And this HAS already happened. Except this very natural social phenomenon, the desire for connection, has been subverted by economic imperatives of the current imperialist system.
9. Organisation:
   The primal connection is the personal one, so at its base it will be organised by physical proximity primarily – that is those that live physically close and wish/are able to share some energy. They organise themselves in another network of the same structure, but connected by shared purpose, (or idea, or project)
   - collectives, co-operatives, clubs - whatever form of co-operation suits them and their needs.
     For instance, [solar power projects](new_energy.html).
10. Responsive:
    This is not an absolute, one size fits all, type of solution.
11. Decentralised:
    It aims for a [decentralised system](descentralised.html).
12. Fractal:
    Fractal nature of the structure. It manifests the same structure at all levels. This is how one maintains the integrity of the structure. It has many similarities to present infrastructures, but has smaller distances between each level.

## Goal of the n/w:

As far as the network is concerned, the basic concept is to create a sovereign, independent network, that will rely on the public network as little as is practically possible. It will local mesh networks, home based servers providing resources and protection.

---

## Ideal

“Creating a dynamic balance between a centralised control based paradigm and local sovereignty/empowerment."

## The Tree power dynamics

Although the structure itself is not the new, it will enable, under the correct conditions, for a new foundation to emerge. One which enable the emergence of entities and communities that can support and maintain and allow this new paradigm to stabilise and arise as a relevant influence on the current paradigm.

It uses the principle of “when the people lead, the leaders will follow”. The power comes from below, facilitated by the power which is above. There is enough will and creativity amongst all of us who envision another way of relating to the world around us to manifest the world we wish to live in.

This expressive form of the network is tree like, which represents a more natural hierarchy: "the less the power and the greater the area of responsibility, the less the power. Whilst the smaller the domain, the greater the power & 'individual' sovereignty, as well as greater decision making power." This allows for the ultimate responsibility to lie on as low a level as is feasible. It envisages a structure that functions on the local level with global reach/functionality as well. An expression of the 70's slogan, "Act locally, think globally".

---

## By the people, for the people

Local empowerment is created by a truly representative system in which each voice can be heard. The Network is a technology to enable such a system. This non-hierarchical principle is etched into the system itself.

Each decision will be made by consensus [partial consensus](partial_consensus.html) and even the dissenting voices will be recorded and acknowledged. No one will be excluded from the decision making process and this is manifest on all levels of the network. This mechanism will be embedded in the network structure itself – or more accurately – in the protocols of communication of the network itself.

The way to prevent the network from being overrun by unnecessary "noise", chatter, etc, is by organising the network into cells of maximum 12 active members. Their collective voice is the voice that is heard in the network.

---

## Stand up. Be counted

Weave a web, a global village, within the infrastructure of the world as it is today. As each person is ready, he or she alone or within a group, will decide to begin the _aliyah_ (up-rising) to the (w)hole(y) land, where we will grow our seeds in that land promised to us - the world we have dreamt of living in, _olam ha-bah_, and have the freedom to have whatever relationship with the Divine we are able. But, this time, we cannot be led by a prophet to this new world, instead, we have to both learn both how to receive and how to build this new world. Those that are not ready, but have the same dream, support this web, enable it, from outside, praying and working with all of us towards the day that we will all have completed our journey and able to engage in the land flowing with milk and honey.

Then will begin the real work, of sustaining it for the coming generations...

1st goal: Create n/w (IT)
1st stage: People transition to n/w (Marketing)
2nd goal: create reasonably self-sufficient, but productive, areas (Building)
2nd stage: enable people to transition to working in areas of production and supply (Enabling)

- Connect all cultural creatives in clusters
- Count all votes to decide an issue (vote) = popular democracy.
- Everybody has an vote – might be influenced by distance from the issue at hand.
- Organic, creating company (corporeation) to support our lives

This is a structure upon which we can begin to build a New Paradigm (NP).

- Loose enough to allow expression,
- Coherent enough to enable collaboration.

1. Purpose: Emergence

   - Enable collaboration between, emergence of, all various positive expressions of this paradigm (ala positive deviance)
   - Methods to deal with inevitable negative expressions
   - Enable creation of pockets, spaces, in which the expression can take place
   - Enable people to transition their energy from feeding the current paradigm to feeding the NP. (Wolf story)

2. Structure

   - Organise network into tree structure with parent(s) part of “parent” group.
   - All decisions percolate up the tree via the parent.
   - Used for communication, and organisation

### Questions

- How am I going to join with other people at this stage to form a seed for the flower to bloom?
- What does it look like in my life?
- How does it fit into my life?
- How does it affect, or improve, my life?
- How is it going to affect my life such that I am going to want to offer the time and energy on n/working?
- How & why?

### Example: Organic/local produce

- How to create widespread production & consumption of organic produce
- How many can we realistically feed this way?
- Do we have enough people to form an effective organic producer, supplier and consumer network? One that can survive and even flourish?

### TAE Stuff

I have felt sense of a structure, almost [Ark](ark.html) (Noah's)
I have an idea of a place to start. But I cannot do it alone. I need all your help; and even that of all your relations. Everyone who dreams of this way, has "family" with whom he has dreamt this dream.

There is a very natural structure that will enable us to usher a way to survive, while providing, encouraging, empowering the space to express our sacred being. A space within which there is the possibility of greater resonance amongst ourselves and our fellow beings and the environment. Another way to exist. But we have to do the work. It is not going to magically transform. We are the 3d, material expression of all that happens to us.

We need to build this structure, connecting all who believe in a more human(e) way of life in the world – physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. A world that is founded on truth and trust. A world in which we can be and are kind(er) to ourselves and to one another. By this connection we build the structure that will be alive with the expression of this dream - the dream of all who are oppressed and live in bondage - that we all share.

---

### Web

The web arose from our deep desire for connectivity with one another. In addition, we would like more connection with and control over all the basic aspects of our lives, especially the critical ones like water, food, air, house, health, energy, education, sewage, clothing, etc.

To reduce that all to one single unit of measurement, money, is diabolical.

The web provides a moving picture of the relationships between people. And as such can be used to more accurately forecast social movements. Just like the weather stations collect samples over a spread of space and time and thus can predict our weather, fairly accurately.

The web is expressing a certain coherence to enable efficient communication between the nodes of the network. Each tier is structured similarly, and is layered to allow for more efficient transmission of information.

If one mapped a Tree of Life onto that already existing web, it would provide a structure upon which to build another sort of interaction and transaction that is more attuned to US.

The web already exists. The Tree of Life Network, which is a mapping of our coherence, doesn’t.

We believe that we will have more freedom once the basic necessities of life are taken care of.

But then "[Freedom](freedom.html) for... what?"

1. Organise in self-similar manner
   Image: Seeds of Life gather to form a Flower of Life, which we call a lotus - or locus - of life, and it becomes the focus of your life. Each cluster will eventually connect to every other. In the meantime, we continue to plant the seeds which grow into trees, for within the flowers is a structure called the Tree of Life. This structure is a key that opens at least one portal.
2. Only purpose of the tree like structure of the n/w is to disseminate information amongst the nodes. It will collect and collate this information, so that we can draw a map of the body that we are part of.
3. Smallest unit is “affinity group” organised with an _abba_ or and _imma_ or both.
   Each affinity group clusters around a sacred center, like an honeycomb

## Benefits of a coherent social network

> These benefits are as trustworthy as the network is.
> If the information & communication it is truthful, then the information is worthy of trust.

### Information:

Verified **info**:
The network will provide access to all information. But will differentiate between that which has been verified, and that which has not.

It can also contain access to lists of people/companies offering products or services who are part of the network and as such are answerable to this community. Can verify the company too.

### Connection:

    Enable connections & communications between people of like mindedness.

### Markets for products:

- Closer **connection** between producer and consumer.
- Always by closest to consumer.
- If not, track reason.
- Support for manufacture of these products
- possible to list products and their availability for people to purchase.

### Education/Training:

- Place for **education**

### Support:

Support of one another's initiatives/ventures; especially those that sustain the members of the network.

### Transparency:

Keep track of politicians, movement of money, bills, etc.

### Consolidation:

    Groups list what they require. As it percolates up the network it aggregates, and the figures become more realistic for the larger network, and if there is a large enough desire, someone should step forward to supply this product to the consumer. It will give people incentives to begin such enterprises having an idea of what this market is.

### Commercial force:

With consolidation and focus of purchasing power will enable us to focus our energy and resources to make this more natural and organic lifestyle to be sustained and made more easily available to members and the general public.

### Voting block:

Similarly, we can produce candidates and support politicians that vote in the support of life and not money/material/death.

### Community:

    - A place where you can live a more earthly/human lifestyle.
    - A place where we can seek and find for this more holistic lifestyle.
    - A place where those that are seeking to change their lifestyle can transition to.

### Empowerment:

    A place where your voice will be heard. A way in which we can express our opinions and our vote will make a difference. A place where everyone is involved to whatever extent they wish to be in any and all decisions. Something we call [_partial consensus_](consensus.html)

---

## People centric:

The ideal would be to be fully connected, however this is not possible. It would require way too much resources to build, let alone maintain. Need to be organised more efficiently so that the process is streamlined.

The essence of this proposal is change the foc use the incredible technologies that already exist in the realm of computers to connect people instead of hardware and/or software (apps). That the very technologies that enable computers to connect, monitor, react, spawn, maintain, design and architect be used to connect us and be used to further humanities needs and desires, instead of a small elite.

To use the current technologies to create people-centric, instead of computer-centric networks. This is what the web spawned, and the FB's & Googles of the world perfected. The defect in the model appeared when, in order to succeed (financially) in the current socio-economic climate, it had to adopt the current model, and, run according to the dynamics of a successful business. However, when you are using technology in a unique fashion, and producing something new, your model begins to define the future of business, and thus, the regulatory systems of the current system are left in the dust, trying to grapple with the new, barely understood, models that are now dominant.

In short, those that succeeded in managing the human/social interactions on this massive scale, were shaped by the environment in which they thrived. What if these same technologies - often freely or easily available - were harnessed to benefit the participants, and not primarily economically?

My belief is that any governing/managing/supervising leadership role is first and foremost to ensure that those who are under its care have their basic needs taken care of. This, in itself, is a massive task. "First, take care of the elderly, the widow & the orphan." But that will bring much peace and prosperity to the people. If we could have a global system that ensured that, it could bring much stability to the world as we know it.

How to do that? By a massively global system of co-operation and co-ordination to ensure that the system's balance is maintained That will also require other re-assessments, that will have to be agreed upon. If a group, or community do not wish to practice in the same way, there is no requirement or enforcement thereof. They are welcome to participate in any and all of our social or business ventures - but they may not have restricted access and rights within the network itself.

They are welcome to participate in our exchange system as well. It is based purely on [energy exchange](energy_exchange.html)

## Requirements:

### Belief

Believe that our hearts are all aligned with the same basic desires for peace of mind, for forgive ness, for love, for upliftment of one another. That we are on the same team, and can recognise one another energetically. Have faith in this vision that we all hold in our hearts of a peaceful world.

### Faith

Have faith in this vision that we all hold in our hearts of a peaceful world.

### Commitment

A commitment is required to the network, its protocols and needs, that needs to be expressed in action

### Support

This is the support, both in energy and time that is required, to create and make the network a successful and beneficial structure.

### Confidentiality

There is an aspect of privacy, of confidentiality (in confidence) that is required to be maintained in the network. Thus it spreads by word of mouth, and the stuff of the network is kept within the confines of the network. The container must be sturdy to hold the energy, otherwise it is always leaking.

### Responsibility

This refers to the responsibility one takes towards ones group and ones “children” as well as to any person who you have invited into the network as his or her sponsor.

### Trust

We must trust one another
Circles of trust within greater circles forming the flower of life. Circles of trust & intimacy & ceremony.

### Transparency

Honesty and openness in all transactions.

### Truthful

## 4 Noble TruthsNo stealing, no lying.

1. Right action
2. Right speech
3. Right thoughts
4. Love

## Principles:

1. **Open**:
   All decisions, decision making, minutes of meetings and opinions regarding said decisions are available to all. They will reside in a central repository that is available to all members of the network. All access to these documents will also be recorded. (The unpredictable always comes from the dark unknown).

2. **PopDem**:
   All decisions are carried by vote, and everyone has a vote. Also everyone has a say, and those are collated and aggregated to give us the map of the terrain. A topological representation of people needs and desire, from the information of what it is that people want. A possibility is that votes could be weighted by distance from the issue. This is to foster local empowerment as well. There could be other extensions.

## Purpose

Coherent activities through coordinated action to enable the flow of:

- information
- co-ordination
- communication
- products
- requests
- opinions (votes)
- options (diversity)

## Goal

```
Live from sacred space &
Practise a sacred way of life &
Foster sacred relationships with yourself,
Your inner space &
The world around you
```

### 1 million

If 1000 people could think one thought, have a common goal, and work towards it.... Unity is strength
What if 1000 became 100,000, what would the effect be?

And 1 million – what that be enough to change the course of humanity’s future?

The idea is extremely simple, based on one of the oldest ideas around “Unity is strength. Divided we fall, united we stand”. The more people we can get acting in a co-ordinated way to produce the kind of lifestyle they dream of, environmentally and in other areas, that is, the more results we will be able to achieve.

There are easily more than a million of us with the same dream, with the same desire. We know and have known for a while now that if we do not do something soon, we are going to enter some extremely difficult times - which have now arrived. I know, I know, we have been hearing it for years, and look, everything looks fine - doesn't it?

If there were 1 million people acting in accordance, dedicated and working fulltime to creating and building a more sustainable way of life, if they were all dedicated to living and maintaining such a system, incorporating the humanistic values that we all revere, the world would already be a different place.

But are there a million of us who are willing to organise into a coherent unit and face the onslaught of the current paradigm? To man the bridges, so as to say, and hold off the attackers, until the climate changes to be more accepting of another way of life - or one or the other side dies trying.

## The Tree

**The Tree is the shape/entity that emerges/forms out of the background of the Web of Life.**

```
NOTE:
Must stop referring to it as a tree. That is what confuses people. I must refer to it as the Web of Life, the Web of Truth, the Web of Trust.
Does the Web of Truth & Trust = Web of Life?
When asked: Why a Tree (of Life Network)? That will only be explained to those who can understand.

Perhaps, at the present stage of the game, we do not need affinity groups, a reason to collaborate. There seems to be more pressing and real reasons to gather.

Let us refer to the leaf group as a node or pod or cell or family.
Cells cluster.
Then we form collectives.
Then we form corporeations.
Then we are crowned with sovereignty.
```

## One sentence statement:

    1. In order to move from the current paradigm requires a non-hierarchical, self-sustaining  system that will more accurately map our future needs, and thus enable us to use that information to more efficiently direct our energy towards the human potential to be realised.
    2. In order to change the current paradigm we need to enhance the current pyramidical framework to enable and empower the people, who form the nodes at the edges of the system – the so-called leaves of the tree.  This is done by creating a system, a coherent connected network in which the leaf nodes are heard and can be acknowledged.
    3. This new system can be manifested by a hierarchy called a tree, that is dedicated to a purpose that enables the leaf nodes to be empowered by their access to the benefits and channels of communication and organisation provided by the greater network. This is an expression of the local empowerment with global reach.

## Parables

### Freedom:

Space to be, without unnecessary fear.
I envisage freedom as the space and the resources to express that creative energy that lurks inside me and is begging to be allowed to manifest in my life.
Each day I am in gratitude for the blessing of the constraint in which my spirit, which yearns to be free, is bound.

### Web:

Playing the strands brings another into the greater vibration, the song of my web.

### Vision:

To be part of something greater – shifting towards a fuller way of life as a human being on this earth – battling with the desire to be myself; and dealing with the constant reflection I see in the world around me.

---

### Fractal coherence:

Knowing the pattern. The pattern that makes up the structure is coherent in a fractal sense, in that it repeats itself from the smallest component to the largest.

At each point, at each breath, I imagine the infinite walking into the rabbit hole of the fractal. But I fear no evil for the universe is coherent (& the Lord is my witness).

Form of fractal coherence which allows for greater space of movement (Mei Wan Ho’s: The crystal is the form that allows the greatest degrees of freedom). Freedom is found by balancing constraint. Only by acknowledging myself as part of the web of life, can I find the place that I can truly be. In the truth of my being I acknowledge that the totality is far larger that I could ever know, that I exist in a web, as a jewel in the Net of Indra.
The fractal is embedded in the I of each of us. I embrace the web of which my life is woven, the net of my life following the strand of convenience.

#### Triangles: smallest component

The smallest component is to be that of triangles.
If you are an individual, find 2 people who are part of the network, and join that triangle. Or find 2 friends who are willing to participate therein, and form a triangle with them.

- Now, what is that you wish to build?
- What do you need?
- What can you offer?

Two triangles, arranged correctly form a .... square!

These will form into groups of 3 or 4 triangles, forming affinity circles of 9 - 12 of these triangles.
This group meets less frequently, and is used as the collection point, or bridge, for this circle.
The information from this circle is then propagated up in the same manner, 1 connection from each circle propagating upwards to the next level of collation. Thus decisions can be heard, and will be collected and propagated further in the network essentially by quantity of votes, and hopefully no other criterion. [I say hopefully here, because there might have to be some caveats introduced here for who knows what the future holds.] Which will by then be connected to the greater network, and just have administrative function within the structure itself.

## Unification

We unify because we truly want the same things. We don’t unify because we want to be able to express our own individual truth. But now that we have individuated, how do we cohere again?

```
Unity is strength:
Unity of purpose,
Unity of mind,
Unity of heart,
Unity of morals
Sworn to non-violence.
```

## Join the network

Provide you with all the information publicly and easily available regarding you.
Provide you with a map of all your relationships, interests, etc.
Help asses, define & decide what to do with the information.
Goal is to identify others who would benefit from and be beneficial to the network.

Start by identifying what you are interested in.// This can now be done by mining public data.
So you form affinity group in your present life. Identify all the people who make up this affinity group. Ideally it is people you know, friends preferably.

## Affinity

- spontaneous/natural liking/attraction
- relationship (marriage)
- resemblance in structure
  - similarity in structure, spiritual distance
- suggesting a relationship

- Affinity group:
  - group of people linked by common purpose/interest

> All fractals include the imaginary, and the infinite. Then begin to express a form that replicates itself at each layer.

## Group dynamics:

If issue has 5/5 split, report it as 5/5 split to next level. That collects report from 10 other such groups and collates information.

How to maintain the balance between group and individual?
e.g. How to prevent solar panel company from pushing its product?
By needing it to spread locally and organically.
No blanket marketing? The person will ask for the product from that supplier, because it is the only one, or the most local one, or the best one.

A parent takes on the responsibility of facilitating the communication with the n/w, and thus takes on extra by being on both the groups. There is also the possibility of the parent of the child group communicating with one of the members of the “parent” group.

## Sponsors

As well as the sponsors. The person that brought that individual (or group) into the network. If there is an altercation, we call on the sponsor, who should know the person personally, to intervene.

## Cluster

1. Cluster around sacred centre place for inner work
2. Organise by affinity groups of 10, preferably physically connected, by a web-like structure.

> Instance: Religious Jewish communities have to cluster within walking distance around a synagogue.

Difference is that we do not gather around one person. But by acknowledging the sacred, we gather wherever there is a group of 10 or more members. Thus we have the jewels appearing around whom we gather and support.
Previous paradigm: honour 1 person, man, chief, priest, king. Now honour yourself and through that honour, everyone else.
So it is with intention – hallow everything.
Aspect of this work, and this network – there is nowhere to hide. All is being “recorded” and responded to. Thoughts are now alive and affect your brain and everything around.

## Truth temples

3. We welcome the diversity
4. Support building of network
5. All decisions, requests... percolate down from the leaves
6. Organise around purpose, and goal.

## Communications network

> Communications network upon which appear dynamic, purpose-driven webs.

How does it go from this to a network of identifiable leaves and nodes all interconnected, and communicating in a self-replicating fashion? A lot of work. A lot of software needs to be manifested, and the information needs to be input and organised correctly. This will all require a fair amount of engineering time.

People join and participate "For the greatest good of all". Because "Together we stand, divided we fall".
