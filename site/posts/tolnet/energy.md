# Energy

Just before energy release, there is the greatest pressure. That is due to the fact that it has to reach critical mass/density/energy in order to have enough force to expand or replicate - which is an organic way to expand.

## Dynamic principle of Evil

One of the most effective tools of the _Sitra Ahara_, the "Other Side", Satan, is to keep us bus with the mundane aspects of our lives, thus leaving no space for the Divine. All relationships need attention to flourish. If there is no time for a relationship with the Father, than eventually the two of you will become somewhat estranged and unfamiliar.

## M&f

The desire for power, greed, is a feminine trait. It devours whatever it can, an unbalanced form of receiving.

## Form & force

- **Form**: energy at rest.
- **Force**: energy in (linear) movement.
