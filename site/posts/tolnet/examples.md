# Examples of networks

Mathematically, a network is a graph with a set of nodes and a set of pairs of nodes called edges.

What's the difference between graphs and networks? While a graph is an abstract mathematical object, a network is a real-world web with specific structural properties. These properties have been exploited to investigate the origin and evolution of networks and to study the processes taking place on them.

Here are some examples:

1. **The Internet.**
   This is a collection of physical routes linked by various physical lines. The Internet is a growing network with no central control authority.

   In the creation of a new seed, the basic node, or affinity group, two factors will determine whom to connect to: distance and bandwidth. While distance puts obvious constraints, bandwidth, which is a measure of the connection between the two people in a group, will typically be the dominant factor.

2. **The World Wide Web.**
   This is a directed network in which nodes represent Web pages and edges are the hyperlinks between pages.
   This type of network is known as unweighted, as it is makes no intrinsic difference to the network how many connections any page is linked to, except for mapping purposes. But the web continues to function if there is one link between the page or hundreds.

   Most surveys of the web look at the connections between pages, or (see 2 below) the physical connections between the computers that make up the web (ie the internet).

3. **Social Networks**
   However, for our purposes, we are more interested in the connections between people. These are known as social
   networks, and are mainly tracked as social connections that have emerged via the internet.

   But there are many types of social networks. Our family is one. Your social circle is another. Both provide good examples of interlinking networks, webs are they are commonly referred to. Or one could think of them as circles that intersect at a certain point. John, your best friend works at IBM. Jill, your girlfriend works for an NGO... etc.

4. **Social networks.**
   Social networks link people according to various social relationships, like acquaintance, friendship, collaboration, and sexual relation. They are of paramount importance to understand and anticipate the spread of ideas, innovations, and fads.
5. **Food webs.**
   These are networks created by nature. In food webs, species are connected by links telling which species feeds on which other species. The links of these networks seldom go both ways, and hence food webs are also an example of directed networks.

6. **Economic networks.**
   Market can be viewed as a huge directed multi-relational network. Companies, firms, financial institutions, governments play the role of nodes. Links symbolize different interactions between them, for instance purchases and sales or financial loaning, and the weight of the links captures the value of the transaction.

7. **Powerline and airline networks.**
   These are human-made networks. Failures may have cascading effects.

Some of these networks are made by nature, other are built by humans. All of them are webs without a spider: there exist no central authority that regulates their growth, but they evolve in a self-organized and decentralized way.

The majority of these networks have existed for many years, some of them (biological networks) are here since millions of years. In the last years many researchers independently showed that real networks have similar architectures, regardless of their age, function, and scope, that elude the random world. Nature doesn't play dice, and neither human builders of networks.

4. Citation networks.
   An article citation network links scholarly papers through bibliographic references contained in the bibliography of the papers.
