<h4>Enduring in Restraint</h4>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

Effective discipline must be enduring and tenacious. Is my discipline consistent or only when forced? Am I perceived as a weak disciplinarian?

</div>

As multi-dimensional beings, we walk an ancient wilderness at the very same time we live our lives here and now. Our journey calls us to balance the energies which give us Life and Purpose. So this eleventh step, this day of bringing **Netzach** into **Gevurah**, the Light within connects the left shoulder with the right hip.

**Gevurah** gives shape to the emotional outpouring of **Chesed** that it might realise itself in the world. **Netzach** symbolises those energies, as they will express themselves in the physical realm. The channel of Light in our visualization crosses through **Tiferet**, and is blessed by that centre of compassionate awareness, that our physical vitality might be experienced with greater integrity and meaning.

We are to give special attention to the physical energies which flow through us and with which we carve out the emotional, psychological, and spiritual foundations of our Universe. **Netzach** channels the Universal that It might more fully express in the world.

Give special attention to the physical energies which flow through us and which are not yet manifest. Reverberations which have appeared as perceptions and sensations are restrained through **Gevurah**. Within this week of limitation the incredible vitality of this not-yet-realized aliveness is contained.

**Gevurah** balances itself this week, bringing in each of the other seven _sefirot_. Today **Gevurah** meets the energy which has been birthed through her, and perhaps appreciates more fully the implications of her role.

<div class="abstract">

I honour the physical energies of Life which fill me everyday. I trust the forms through which these energies express from the deeper integrity of my Being. My actions in the world grow to reflect more completely the Life which infuses all things.
</div>

## Reflections

**Trust over Hope**

<div class="note">

Trust transcends hope, as the sky above transcends the earth below.

A thread of hope is an anchor to the ground, a narrow path you’ve set for destiny to lead you.

The thread snaps and your eyes look up to see nothing more than the open sky. Hope is gone. All you can do now is trust the One who has no bounds.

That is Trust: When you stop suggesting to your Maker how He could rescue you. When you are prepared to be surprised by wonders and open to miracles.

<div class='note'>

Pure **Chesed** (חסד) is pure emotion, and as such has no form. It _has_ to be contained by **Gevurah** (גבורה) to take and express form.

Allowing and focussing on emotions ends up having no form, producing no clarity. Thus I seek that balance.

</div>
