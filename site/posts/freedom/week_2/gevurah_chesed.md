**Chesed** of **Gevurah** is the love in discipline; awareness of the intrinsic love that feeds discipline and judgement. It is the recognition that your personal discipline and the discipline you expect of others is only an expression of love. It is the understanding that we have no right to judge others; we have a right only to love them and that includes wanting them to be their best.

Counting the Omer is a metaphor for counting the steps on the journey from slavery to freedom, from unconsciousness to greater awareness. The journey, of course, is never quite that simple. We are not coming from total unconsciousness, nor are we going to be able to achieve full awareness this year. Yet our task is to meet the challenge of becoming more aware of the Life that is your life, of the Freedom that awaits you. So we begin the second week of our journey.

This second week focuses on **Gevurah**, the _sefirah_ placed at the left shoulder which balances **Chesed** on the right side. **Gevurah** itself symbolises the dark side, the _Sitra Achra_, the place of Other. It holds the possibility of being mere shell without energy. It is the place of the shadows lacking light. It is the place of restriction and constriction, since it limits the pure flow from **Chesed**. Because it provides a form for **Chesed**, it allows that Love to manifest. Because any form will limit **Chesed**, it threatens to strangle the very energies for which it is a vessel. At **Gevurah** we sense most clearly the essential paradox of form.

Since **Gevurah** expresses itself as the form of emotions, it is our task to to inform these emotions the energy of Love that flows from **Chesed** to better recognize and appreciate the feelings which have arisen within us. This first day of the second week brings **Chesed** into **Gevurah**, to help us sense the presence of that Lovingkindness within all the feelings we experience.

This week we focus on the left shoulder, and today we imagine a channel of light between the illuminations at left and right shoulder. Notice that this channel passes through the throat, which is the place that we enter and impact the world with our words. With this awareness, we enter into our experience this day.

<p style="font-style: italic; margin: 2rem; text-align: justify">
On this day, I encourage myself to awaken to a new reverence for Life, focusing on the Breath of Life energy within every feeling that awakens within me. I accept that the energy of Lovingkindness animates all forms. This awareness helps me appreciate the incredible dance of feelings I experience. My life is filled with blessings.
