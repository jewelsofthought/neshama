<div class="abstract">

If love (**Chesed**) is the basis of human connection, discipline (**Gevurah**) is the form through which we express love. It gives our life and love shape and focus. **Gevurah**&mdash;discipline and measure&mdash;concentrates and directs our efforts, our desire and love into directions that will emerge in **Malchut**. Another aspect of **Gevurah** is respect and awe. Healthy love requires respect for the one you love.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Setting Limits</h3>
<div class="abstract">

Breathe quietly, noticing the nature of my experience at this moment. Become more deeply aware of the feelings that are attached to all my thoughts and sensations. Each feeling limits emotional energy and allows it to be experienced and absorbed into my personal space.

</div>

## The Sefirah on the Tree of Life

**Gevurah**, “Strength”, is also seen as the _sefirah_ of Judgement, or _Din_. **Gevurah** is on the left side of the Tree which represents form. It is within the World of Form that the polarities of our experiences unfold. **Gevurah** represents those forms we call “feelings”, forms which limit and channel emotional energy. With **Gevurah** happiness as well as sadness, pleasure as well as pain are the emotional forms that emerge in our lives. We cannot know one without the other. So **Gevurah** is seen as the origin of “evil”, since it is the place where we first feel “good”, and thus the place of where we also encounter the opposite of "good", and the judgement of both.

The first **sefirah** on the left side of the Tree is **Binah**, "Understanding", but it is at **Gevurah** that the distinction and polarities that we recognise arise. At **Binah**, the form which contains the flow from **Chochmah**, "Wisdom", is still Unitive. Not until emotional form is present can polarity truly be known.

**Gevurah** is the place of limitation, the place at which cold-heartedness enters the world. **Gevurah** contains whispers of evil, of the “other side”. But **Gevurah**'s a function, one which requires a great deal of “strength”, is to realise **Chesed**.

Not until a feeling takes shape in our beings can we begin to experience the world of emotion. Each feeling is itself a limitation of the inevitable flow of life through **Chesed**. We resist these feelings and so become stuck in them. We are so caught up in what has become familiar&mdash;the roles and scripts about who we are, how we are and why we are the way we are&mdash;that we close ourselves off from the possibilities inherent in each moment.

**Gevurah** is our tendency to cling to our favourite feelings, refusing to release them, thus block the nourishing energies of **Chesed** from flowing more freely into our lives.

The fundamental dynamics of life emerge at **Binah**, while **Gevurah** is the space where the polarities are born&mdash;the polarities of our very existence&mdash;good and evil, higher or lower, bigger and smaller, better or worse. The way that feeling limits and holds and shapes emotional energy almost automatically creates its opposite, for feelings are known by their compliments. Without hard, there would be no soft. Without “easy”, how would we know “difficult”? Without “boredom”, we could not identify “excitement”.

**Gevurah** provides the elements of our dreams and of our nightmares, yet it is absolutely essential to manifest our Creative Energy. This week, focus on the forms of your feelings, noticing the polarities they bring and celebrate them. There is no need to resist any feeling, because when feelings are allowed, they reveal themselves – and from this awareness, they shift.

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 130%">
The Name of G-d<br />
at <strong>Gevurah</strong><br />
is <em>Elohim</em>,
<h4 style="font-size: 200%">
אֵלוהים
</h4>
</div>

_Elohim_, is the Name associated with judgement and severity, and so is associated with this _sefirah_. In Jewish tradition, the two most used names of G-d are _Elohim_ and _Adonai_ (written **YHVH**). _Elohim_ is generally translated as “G-d”, though it meaning is more accurately "G-d of Hosts". _Adonai_ is generally translated as “Lord” or “Eternal One”.

_Elohim_ is actually the plural form of the noun, yet it is almost always translated as if it were singular, and takes a singular verb and modifier. One way of explaining this is to understand _Elohim_ as the One Being, _Adonai_, appearing to our awareness as the many. _Elohim_ can be appreciated as the Presence of _Adonai_ within each individual being, enabling us to experience the Immanent aspect of the Divine. This Presence is named _Shechinah_, which is also another name for _Elohim_ in the ancient mystical text called the _Zohar_ or “Book of Splendour”. _Shechinah_ is also the Presence of the Transcendent _Adonai_ present in all living things, as well as the world itself!

## Meditation for the Second Week at <i>Gevurah<i>

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
הַרְפּ֣וּ וּ֭דְעוּ כִּֽי־אָנֹכִ֣י אֱלֹהִ֑ים
</p>
<p>
Be still, and know that I am Elohim.<br />
-- (Psalm 46:11)
</p>
</blockquote>

<div style="font-style: italic; margin: 2rem; text-align: justify">

Sitting and breathing calmly, become aware of your current experience in the world. Focus on your feelings as they arise. Begin to appreciate them without judgement.

</div>

This exploration requires us to embrace the immediacy of the present moment. As we focus fully and persistently on the contents of our awareness, each moment naturally expands. There is so much more in each moment, in each sensation and feeling, than I had ever noticed before.

<h3>Personal Reflections</h3>

<div class="note">

>Shadows are feelings we hold onto.

This starts with the non-acceptance somewhere in our ancestral line of feelings and desires, passed down through the generations, until it becomes embedded in the psyche of the community or nation.

Thus the suppression of a young girl's feelings could produce a mother/woman who wants people&mdash;especially her own children&mdash;to express their feelings. For a young boy, whose innocent desires were suppressed, might result in aberrent desires expressed in the realm of relationships.

The suppression of feelings would also result in all sorts of idol (i.e. material) worship. For instance, alchoholism&mdash;or alcho-holism: the religion of worshipping the unholy demon of alchohol&mdash;whose holy essences abound and whose worshippers can obtain endless supplies of said essences, which reduce them to becoming mere puppets of its will.
