<h4>Connection through Restraint</h4>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

For discipline to be effective it must be coupled with commitment and bonding. Both in disciplining yourself and others,there has to be a sense that the discipline is important for developing a stronger bond. Not that I discipline you, but that we are doing it together for our mutual benefit.

</div>

Thirteen is a number of good omen in Jewish lore. In the _gematria_ it is the sum of the numerical letters of _Echad_, which means “One”, as well as the gematria of _Ahavah_, “Love”. Added together, the numerical values of the words “One” and “Love” equal 26, which is the _gematria_ of the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter unspeakable name of G-d: __Yod-Key-Vav-Key__, which we pronounce as _Adonai_. This gives us a hint of the special energies available to us this day.

Today the energies of __Yesod__ enter into __Gevurah__. __Yesod__ is the “Foundation”, the place of ego, located energetically just above the genitals of the body. We focus our attention on the channel of light between the left shoulder and the pubic area. We bring our ego into the place of Limitation to seek its proper form. Ego is always in need both of higher energy as well as more effective structure. __Yesod__ brings the Foundation of personal identity into the realm of __Gevurah__, so that __Yesod__ might know the nature of the identity carrying Holy Energy into the world.

The placing of __Yesod__  at the area of the loins on the Tree of the body reflects the influences of sexuality. Our ego identity is largely bound up in our sexuality, in the challenge not only to act in the world with sexual integrity, but to balance within each one of us the energies of the male and the female, the giving and receiving.

__Yesod__ is the centre of the soul which the Zohar, “The Book of Splendour” calls the _nefesh_. It is the vivifying soul, our “animal” soul. The _nefesh_, cut off from higher energies is separate and competitive; while the _nefesh_ that receives along a clear channel from the Source enables that Source to express itself more effectively in this realm.

Through _nefesh_ we know the pain of separateness, the powerlessness of our self when collapsed into alienation from the world and from others. We grow to respect the integrity of our  selves as we move through the illusions that this realm is all there is and assert the influences of a deeper awareness. __Yesod__ moves into __Gevurah__ to receive the blessing of its proper form.

<div class="abstract">

I am filled with deep respect for the expression of my uniqueness in the world. All the energies of my being are blessed through my connection to the Source of all Being. My body, my mind, and my emotions serve as a vehicle for Being.
</div>

## Personal Reflections

<div class="note">

The _nefesh_, once it begins to gain power, has a single, driving purpose – that is to make the whole world in its own image – in order to bring “peace”! That is the masculine dynamic. However, only by reigning in that outpouring drive to conquer and subjugate, and using that very energy to constrain and direct the thrusting force of _nefesh_, can its overpowering energy be directed to more nourishing expressions. This is the feminine dynamic. It is like a fire that needs to be managed. This is why it is called the vivifying soul – the burning soul – reminiscent of the angelic energies we call the _chayot_, the angels that burn with life energy.
