<h4>Receptivity in Restraint</h4>

<div class="abstract">

Discipline, like love, must enhance personal dignity (see week one day seven). Discipline that breaks a person will backfire. Healthy discipline should bolster self-esteem and help elicit the best in a person; cultivating his sovereignty. And that does not compromise the discipline; on the contrary it fosters and enhances it.

</div>

We are concluding the second week of our journey. The week in **Gevurah** ends by bringing in **Malchut**, the lowest _sefirah_. The channel of Light reaches from the left shoulder to the base of the spine.

**Malchut** is the Kingdom. It is the _sefirah_ of our earthly existence, receiving the energies from the entire Tree. In most kabbalistic sources, it is the place of the indwelling presence, called _Shechinah_, the feminine aspect of the Divine One. It is our task to build a holy temple for _Shechinah_ to reside in this realm. This is done through the reintegration of Holy Energies in our lives.

**Malchut** seems like the land of limitations&mdash;limitations that we impose by measurement and judgment. It is the place in which we become dissonant and lose ourselves in unconscious drives and desires. At the same time, we are called upon to remember in this land of forgetting. We are the ones with the possibility of awakening in the land of the sleepers.

This whole week in **Gevurah** has been filled with the challenge of realising the necessity of limitation, to perceive the appropriateness of the forms through which the One might speak. In **Malchut** we are surrounded with forms that seem silent, so it is our task to learn to listen more carefully, to become receptive to that which is hidden right in front of our eyes.

**Malchut** brings to **Gevurah** the ultimate expression of Its form. In **Malchut** we need to challenge **Gevurah** to hold less tightly to the structures it creates, that the worlds which follow might know growth and evolution.

Each of the seven weeks of our counting concludes with the focus at **Malchut**. If we can balance ourselves here, we can bring heaven and earth together.

The way to bring _shalom_, peace within our selves is to balance our internal and external lives, the inner tensions of awareness and confusion, and the external tensions of material existence with its unending needs and desires.

So the last day of this week holds special promise. In our meditations, we celebrate the awakening of **Malchut** in **Gevurah**.

<div class="abstract">

I release my insistence ON things being better than they are that I might instead realise the blessings hidden within the everyday events of my life. There are higher forms that express more fully the energies of holiness flowing from their Source which now manifest through me and around me,
