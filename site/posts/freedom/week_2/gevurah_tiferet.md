<h4>Balance in Restraint</h4>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

Not just love but compassion is also a necessary aspect of discipline for it to be balanced. That results in a discipline that is healthy, and not detrimental. Love comes from recognizing one's merits and positive qualities, but also accepting one's limitations and restraining one's negative qualities. Correct discipline channels and directs those strengths, reducing the influence of the negative. Compassion is unconditional.  Your love is a reflection of G-d. <b>Tiferet</b> is the expression of total selflessness in the eyes of G-d.[^1]

Yesterday **Gevurah** entered into this week of **Gevurah**, bringing focus to the emotional forms of our current creations and the gifts we encounter in our appreciation for the necessity of such forms.

This tenth day **Tiferet** enters into **Gevurah** – bringing harmony and balance into the _sefirah_ of Limitation. **Tiferet** brings its fountain of calmness into **Gevurah**, to enable us to see with greater clarity which emotional forms in our lives have been conceived that will allow us to grow on this journey.

The compassion of **Tiferet**, this deep knowing, will allow **Gevurah** the flexibility to receive greater energies as we proceed on our journey of awakening. Concentrating on the connection of light between the left shoulder and the heart, begin the process of releasing that which had been bound up. Relinquishing old judgements, I can experience a dawning of the wonder of that which was once closed now opening. Light springs forth from the shadows of my self. This day we may meet ourselves anew.

The Heart of Life throbs within my chest, Life's Breath breathes its vitality into every cell of my beings. Through every action or dream or thought or deed, this Life moves through us. Life is an interaction, a co-operation, an interdependence. Life moves, shifts, and expands through and with us.

<div class="abstract">

Today I will open what was closed, awakening new possibilities through the sense of wonder I experience at the opening taking place deeply within myself. I discover a fountain of compassion living and breathing inside me that nourishes the fuller expression of my Being. In this compassion, I radiate new joy from the creation of forms more fitting to my experience of Oneness and Integrity.
