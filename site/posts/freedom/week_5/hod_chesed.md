_Healthy humility is not demoralizing; it bring love not fear. Humility brings joy because it gives you the ability to rise above yourself and love another. Arrogance in the guise of love means loving yourself, or what is even worse: making others a part and an extension of yourself and your self-love._

The fifth week of our counting finds us at **Hod**, the space called Glory, the place of form which receives the vibrational force from **Netzach**. **Hod** is experienced at the left leg, on the left side of the Tree of Life. **Hod** represents physical form, understood through our sensations and perception, and so is the seat of special delights and special dilemmas in our experience of ourselves and the world.

We become enmeshed in our perceptions and our sensations. Nothing supports our proclivities for judgement quite so naturally. We are part of a society which continually evaluates us according to certain standards, on the level of shape and size. Who among is free from such self-evaluation? In this world of form, how often do we experience ourselves as either “too much” or “too little”, rather than “just right?”

Yet without such comparisons, we cannot exist. At each level of form on the Tree, the issues are the same. So we seek to discover the ways to utilise our limits in the service of growth and evolution.

Today we bring **Chesed** into **Hod**. The channel of light flows from the right shoulder to the left hip. We brings the _sefirah_ of Lovingkindness into the _sefirah_ of Perceptual Form. In this connection we seek to bless **Hod** with the energies that support its finest and fullest forms.

With **Chesed** in **Hod**, we open ourselves to reflect the deep Lovingkindness that provides profoundly healing energies. We seek to perceive reflections of that Lovingkindness today. We seek to sense the presence of that freely-flowing source of Life.

_My senses provide an embodiment of Spirit. The blessing of Love supports me in my body and quiets my sense of physical limitation. I become aware of the vital Energy I carry through every cell of my body. I breathe the freshness of_ **Chesed**, _that it might influence all my thoughts, my words, and my actions. I cherish the Love with which I experience myself and with which I experience the world. I open myself to my connections to others and embrace my relationship with all Other._
