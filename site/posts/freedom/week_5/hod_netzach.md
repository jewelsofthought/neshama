<i>Day Four of Week 5:</i> 
<p>Ambition in Humility</p>

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem;">

_Humility and modesty should not cause one to feel weak and insecure. True humility does not make you into a "doormat" for others to step on; on the contrary, humility gives you enduring strength._

_Examine the strength of your humility. Does it endure because I am firm in my positions or do I waffle in the name of humility?_

</div>

On this day of our meditative journey, we bring **Netzach** into the weekly _sefirah_ of **Hod**. There is a meeting of Physical Vitality in the _sefirah_ of Physical Sensation. The Light connects the left and right side of the hips, and we feel grounded and blessed in our physical beings.

We have travelled far already on this journey, and we welcome these energies that allow us to proceed yet further. We begin to know the possibilities that reside in our physical forms, since our bodies allow us to actualise the Spirit for Whom we are messengers in the world.

**Hod** now receives from **Netzach** the outpouring of energy with which it can inform itself most effectively. Without these energies, we are in danger of living as shells, devoid of substance. How often we become entangled in the outer shapes of our physical reality, forgetting that their true beauty comes from that which they contain.

We open ourselves this day to receive that which fills our perceptions with Life, that energy which allows us to grow and to express our truth in positive ways. Our world is so in need of positive expressions of the energies of this Universe.

In this week of **Hod**, we seek the essential mystery behind the physical appearance of this Universe. We seek to know the truer expression of the One Who infuses all form. Without this One, no form would be. Without the form of **Hod**, we could not know the expression of this One.

_There is growing within me a deep balance of energy and form. With every action, I express the holiness of Spirit in the world. Through my perceptions and my actions, I share meaning and purpose with all I meet. I am a channel_[^1] _for the One Life that celebrates all Creation with Blessing._[^2]

</div>

[^1]: Would not Netzach in Hod be expressed as “a desire (ambition) to be a channel...”
[^2]: I am a perfect vehicle for the experience and expression of the One Spirit in this world. Through me, Spirit seeks a Life of Joy and celebration. The forms of my life—mental, emotional, and physical—expand to reflect fuller dimensions of healing and wholeness now. I celebrate the One I am.
