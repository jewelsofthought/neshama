<h4>Connection in Humility</h4>

Humility need not be a lonely experience. There is no stronger bond than one that comes out of humility. It results in deep sharing and commitment.

A day of rejoicing draws to a close, and we are back on our journey, almost to the end of the fifth week. If we are to turn now and look back now, the stepping out from our previous confinement is further behind than we thought. Much has happened. We are moving deeper into the great adventure of Being.

This 34th day of our journey brings **Yesod** into **Hod**. Into the _sefirah_ expressing sensation and perception, we bring the _sefirah_ of our individual identity. **Yesod** carries the energies of the ego-self, with which we must continually interact in the world.

The channel of Light we experience today links the left side of the hips to the loins. We are moving closer towards our goal of manifesting more clarity and blessing in the world.

**Yesod** needs of the Glory of Form which **Hod** can express. **Hod**, in turn, needs the vehicle through which that form can act in the world of being. Each _sefirah_ interacts with the others. None can stand alone. None is less significant in the process of Creation. Each aspect of our being is crucial and precious, just as each of us is crucial and precious in our world.

Personal responsibility awakens at **Yesod**. Today we bring that sense of responsibility into form at **Hod**. Form must find its function through which it can express in the world. Perception must find the observer through which it can be known in the world. It cannot simply contain that which it holds. Our perceptions shape the very nature of our identity, since the creation we experience is a transaction between the observer and that which is observed. **Hod** needs its **Yesod**, its own vehicle for transmitting its fullness. **Hod** informs **Yesod** with its sensations. **Yesod** bases its identity upon the nature of **Hod**'s perceptions.

<div class="abstract">

Today I become aware of the fullness of energies which I receive. My mind, my heart and my body contain the energies of Universal Awareness, Love and Life.

As I become more sensitive to the ways in which my sensations and perceptions influence my identity, I become aware that behind every particular sensation is a freely flowing vital energy; every perception is simply one container through which that energy can be experienced. I am more than my perceptions. I am a channel for the energies of the Universe. I discover different ways of bringing those energies into fuller expression in the world, so that I may express more clearly that which I receive.
