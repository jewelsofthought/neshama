<h4>Harmony in Humility</h4>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

Can you express your humility in an act of compassion? Does it cause me to be self-contained and anti-social or does it express itself in empathy for others. Is it awkward or is it balanced and beautiful?

Just as humility brings compassion, compassion can lead to humility. If you lack humility, try acting compassionately.

</div>

We bring the energies of **Tiferet**, Beauty and Compassion, into our weekly _sefirah_ of **Hod** today. Into the space of our Physical Sensation we bring the blessings of the Heart, that Compassion might soothe the journey of the body in ordinary time and space.

The connection of Light is between the heart space and the left hip. The balancing of our emotions is given as a gift to the pressures of the body. In our struggle to discover through ordinary life the purpose and meaning that whispers from our Source, **Tiferet** brings ever greater clarity and Light.

My physical being responds to the rhythms of the Universe with renewed health and vitality. I strive to express through all that is given me that which I know to be supportive of myself and of others.

Even in the midst of this ancient/modern wilderness, where there is so much confusion and doubt, despair and pain, I choose to live in the vision of wholeness. I insist that our lives have meaning, that our actions and our words can indeed elicit responses far beyond our limited selves’ to conceive.

With the Heart of Compassion glowing strongly within us, we reach out more surely into the world around us. We translate this Compassion through every cell of our beings. We perceive it reflected back to us from all we touch. Nothing is truly separate from the Source of all Life which flows through us.

<div class="abstract">

I walk this planet with a greater sense of inner balance. The Glow of Compassion awakening in the Heart of my being radiates through my physical being. Now with this deeper Beauty of Being . Creation expands through me.
