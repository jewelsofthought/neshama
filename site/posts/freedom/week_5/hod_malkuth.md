<p>Receptiveness in Humility</p>

_Dignity is the essence of humility and modesty. The splendour of humility is majestic and noble. Walking humbly is walking tall. Humility that suppresses the human spirit and denies individual sovereignty is not humility at all._

The week of **Hod** completes itself today, welcoming the tenth _sefirah_ of **Malchut**. With the _sefirah_ called Kingdom, the cycle is grounded this week. We experience the connection of Light as a channel between the left hip and the base of the spine.

The energy of the Tree that manifests at each _sefirah_ allows that _sefirah_ to reflect the energies of the Whole. Each _sefirah_ is fed by what it receives. However, in addition, each sefirah also has its own Tree&mdash;even as this Universe and everything in it, is supported by its own Tree of Life&mdash;and contributes its own aspect, allowing Creation to unfold “as it should”. In **Malchut**, the energy of all the _sefirot_ actualise in the world in which we live, and as **Malchut** is brought into **Hod**, the lower seven _sefirot_ of the Tree are completed in **Hod**.

In this journey process, our aim is to balance these seven lower _sefirot_. In so doing, we create an environment of balanced receptivity. The culmination of this part of our journey is to prepare for Revelation at the moment called Sinai, which is the setting for revelation. We prepare what we can, and trust that the energy of the upper three _sefirot_ will reflect that which we have done. At Sinai, our awaremess of the Tree becomes Whole. That is the nature, always, of authentic Revelation.

As we complete this week, we appreciate more than ever the functioning of **Hod**, the sefirah of perception and sensation which lends stability to our physical experience. We seek this balance through the steps we take on our journey in the wilderness this year.

Of course, that which holds the key to our growth can also serve to enslave us. Such is the Way of our Universe. We look around ourselves now with fuller awareness. Our goal is to sense the rightness of all we see, of all we hear, of all we experience. We rejoice that we are given the realities of the sensations with which we can know our path toward wholeness. Let us celebrate the One that meets us with every sensation we experience.

_I am the Consciousness of Spirit walking this planet. Welcoming all my sensations, my inner being expands with the sense of the Oneness hidden with them. Through my form, I am grateful for all the precious opportunities to experience and express the blessings of Love, Compassion and Vitality._

<h3>Reflections</h3>

“I am the being through whom the Consciousness of Spirit experiences this reality. With my physical form, I carry the Blessing of Spirit into the world. My inner being expands to receive the abundant Light flowing into me. I endeavour to express this Light in ways that support [true healing] Truth in this world.”
