<h4>Restraint in Humility</h4>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

Humility must be disciplined and focused. It must include respect and awe for the person or experience you stand humbly before. Focus on your reluctance in any given area to see if it originates from a healthy, humble place.

</div>

This is the week of **Hod**, the "Glory" of Physical Form, experienced through our sensations and our perceptions. Into **Hod** we bring **Gevurah**, the Severity of Emotional Limitation. We focus our energies on the left side of the Tree, experiencing the connection as a channel of light between the left hip and the left shoulder.

This is a day for consolidating our energies, for appreciating the forms into which they are cast. We are offered precious moments to consider the shape of the emotions which are expressed through the forms and patterns of our lives. We are challenged to care tenderly for our physical selves, and to become more aware than ever of our power to translate ways of wholeness into the world of being.

The world of forms is confusing to us. Often we fail to contain our powerful emotions in ways that support growth, and instead these energies lead us astray. We strive consciously to choose the limits, that we may more fully appreciate the myriad of feelings to which we are heir. To walk in ways of holiness requires such discernment, without preventing expansion and acceptance.

Our meditations for this day focus on the valuations we place on our sensations, on our experiences in the world. We shape ourselves into vessels of Divine expression[^1], that we might see beyond the transient impressions of sensations and physical form.

<div class="abstract">

I am the vehicle through whom Universal Energies flow. Now these forces find humane form to express themselves in my world. I bless the sensations through which I know my body and my world. My vision expands that I might bless the evolving dimensions of our physical experience in the world.

</div>

<h3>Reflections</h3>

[^1]: I would like to shape myself into a "vessel" to receive the Light – when It wishes to grace me with Its form – and a "channel" for that Light to express Itself in the world.
