**Tiferet** &ndash; Compassion &ndash; blends and harmonizes the free outpouring of love from **Chesed** with the discipline of **Gevurah**. **Tiferet** possesses this power by introducing a third dimension&mdash;the dimension of truth, which enables the integration of the two, neither love nor discipline&mdash;yet born from a balance of the two forces.

Truth is accessed through selflessness: rising above your ego and your prejudices, enables you to realize truth. The imbalance of love and discipline (and for that matter, any distortion) is a result of a subjective, hence limited perspective. Introducing truth, by suspending personal prejudices, allows you to express your feelings (including the synthesis of **Chesed** and **Gevurah**) in a balanced fashion.

Breathe quietly, noticing the nature of my experience at this moment. Become more deeply aware of the feelings that are attached to all my thoughts and sensations. Each feeling limits emotional energy and allows it to be experienced and absorbed into my personal space.

**Tiferet** blends the differing colours of love and discipline, and this harmony makes it beautiful. For **Tiferet** to be complete it needs the inclusion of the following seven facets: love of compassion, discipline of compassion, beauty of compassion, endurance of compassion, humility of compassion, bonding of compassion and sovereignty of compassion.

If love (**Chesed**) is the basis of human connection, discipline (**Gevurah**) is the form through which we maintain our love. It gives our love shape and focus. **Tiferet** balances our desire with forms that will emerge in **Malchut** in a healthy way.

<h3 style="text-align:center">Balance in Compassion</h3>

I remember the silence within, I remember to breathe gently and I simply accept my experience of this moment. I discover the space of my expanded identity when I breathe a Universal breath. I am a precious expression of a Universal identity.

## The Sefirah on the Tree of Life

**Tiferet** is the place where there is a deepening of the unfolding of Compassionate Awareness.

The right side of the Tree signifies force, and the left side, form.[^1] The central pillar signifies not only balance but identify. **Tiferet** is the Centre of the Tree of Life, where force and form attain balance.

There are many representations of the Tree which have all the _sefirot_, except **Malchut**, directly connected to Tiferet at the centre. This signifies **Tiferet** as the axis around which all of the other _sefirot_ turn, the centre of the spinning wheel of life. If it is in its place and balanced, it can provide the center of balance between all the different forms and energies of all the other _sefirot_

The identity at **Tiferet** is the Inclusive “I”, the inclusive shared Self behind the exclusive ego-self. In **Tiferet**, there is a balance between the self which resides in the body and the Universal Self that exists beyond differentiation. Here the upper and lower worlds are connected.

Tiferet is the Heart of the Tree, reflected as the heart-space within each one of us. It provides a central focus, a place of deepening of compassionate awareness.

If the central pillar is the place of balance, it must also be the place of tension. **Tiferet** is asked to remain open to both force and form, to avoid the seductions of the limitlessness of force, as well as being bound by the limitations of form. Compassion is the experience at **Tiferet**&mdash;it is the acceptance of all that is given with equanimity. If it is true acceptance, then the flow might be balanced.

Breath is one of the keys to the opening of **Tiferet**-awareness. The Zohar urges, "Breathe like the ocean rises and falls and never becomes full." The breath is received and released fully&mdash;expansion and contraction&mdash;all in the service of Life.

The vowel sounds at **Tiferet** are often experienced as “Ah”, while “Oh” is the sound at **Yesod**, and “Ee” as the sound at **Keter**. In your meditations, you might try these sounds and see what unfolds for you.

## The Name of G-d

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight:bold"> 
The Name of G-d<br />
at Tiferet<br />
is Adonai,<br />
יהוה<br />
which is translated "Eternal One.<br />
</div>

The Name of G-d at **Tiferet** is pronounced _Adonai_, but is written **יהוה** (the Hebrew letters _Yod-Kay-Vav-Kay_). This Name, which is not pronounced, was often translated as “Lord”, but is nowadays referred to as **Ha’Shem**. This name is not pronounced as it is written because it speaks of That Which Is Beyond Name.[^2]

This four-letter name is known as the tetragrammaton, and whenever it appears in the Hebrew Bible or in prayer texts, we pronounce the word _Adonai_. It is important to remember that _Adonai_ is a totally different word which more literally translates as "Eternal Being."

The Name **יהוה**', is a form of the Hebrew verb which means "to be," and so can be translated, "Unlimited Being". That is why many of us translate _Yod-Kay-Vav-Kay_ (saying _Adonai_) as "The Eternal One," or "The Eternal Presence."

## Meditation for the Third Week at TIFERET.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
שִׁוִּ֬יתִי יְהוָ֣ה לְנֶגְדִּ֣י תָמִ֑יד
<p dir="ltr">
I place YHVH before me always.<br />
-- (Psalm 16:8)
</p>
</blockquote>

Today we allow ourselves to awaken to a greater sense of balance. There is a peacefulness which expands within the Heart of our being, a peacefulness which gradually radiates through out consciousness. We open to an awareness that holds compassion for everything it touches.

## Reflections

[^1]: It is not only the balance between force and form, but also in the upper realm, between the expression of Mercy/Compassion versus the structures of Judgement/Strength. In the lower realm, it mediates the expression between physical force and physical forms.
[^2]: The names, the unnameable – any appellation you give to **Ha’Shem** will reduce it. It can only be described by what it is not, never by what it is.
