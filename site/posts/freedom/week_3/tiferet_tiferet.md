True compassion is limitless. It is not an extension of your needs and defined by your limited perspective. Compassion is achieved by having a selfless attitude. Focus on actualizing the compassion in your heart. Focus on what blocks your compassion.
</p>

<p>
Is my compassion serving myself as an expression of my  feelings of guilt? Does my compassion resound with vitality or is it expressed only out of obligation? 
</p>
<p>
Examine and refine your compassion, observing it's limitations and forms of expression.It must contain the other six elements of <b>Tiferet</b>, without which full compassion remains unrealized.
</p>
<p>

Express your compassion in a new way that goes beyond your previous limitations.

In this week of **Tiferet**, we are given a Day of the Heart. We are blessed with **Tiferet** in **Tiferet**, focusing on our higher identity, the one we call _Ruach_, the non-ego identity which senses itself in all beings.

What is healed in **Tiferet**, in the space of the Heart, is the overwhelming sense of separateness with which we often experience ourselves in our world. We reach beyond fragmentation to perceive the deeper Consciousness awakening (which lives) within each of us. In this Consciousness we are always connected. That which animates all Being is One. And in **Tiferet** we touch that One through the gift of Compassion.

Through this awareness we understand that all human possibilities live in each of us. There is nothing truly foreign to us. When we stop throwing others from our hearts by pretending that we are better or that they are better, the possibilities for the healing of humankind can be realised.

Today we renew our dedication to healing by balancing all our human energies in this One Light of Self. Indulgence in violence is a mockery of evolution. Compassion for our darkness opens up the way to true growth.[^1]

We seek to balance the energies of light and dark, high and low, heaven and earth. From that balance, transformation emerges. In **Tiferet** we accept all selves, that we might more clearly discern the higher Self we share. Through this Identity, we can awaken to the truth of our own uniqueness.

<div style="font-style: italic; margin: 1rem 2rem; text-align: justify">

I open to the Light of **Tiferet** , receiving this Light in my heart-space until it fills my entire body. A deep inner healing flows from the blessing of every cell and every level of my being. This Light expands beyond my self, reflecting back to me from all whom I meet. The myriad of energies swirling around and within me meet and merge in this Light. In the Light of Compassion I am One.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

[^1]: Be careful with this, as unconditional love loves evil too, allowing it to flourish. Compassion mixed with limitation, opens up the way for growth. It is a dynamic interplay between two forces, and here we are focusing on the point/fulcrum of dynamic balance.
