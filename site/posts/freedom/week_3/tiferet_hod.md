Compassion must include humility. May I remain humble and thankful to G-d in my compassion for others.

Into the _sefirah_ of **Tiferet**, the place of the Heart, we bring **Hod**, the ‘Glory’ of physical form. The symbolic place of **Hod** in the body is the left hip area, so the clear channel of Light today connects that area to your heart-space.

**Hod** represents the form needed to shape the energies flowing in from **Netzach**, enabling those physical energies to manifest as specific physical sensations in the world. On the Tree of Life we are continually challenged to match force and form, to balance the energies of expression with those of receptivity. One without the other cannot exist.

Yet if the force is too great for the form, the imbalance created leaves our energies spilling over aimlessly in the world. If the form is too great for the force, we experience the hollow of pretence.

True Balance is not achieved once and for all. Each new balancing leads to the next imbalance. According to the kabbalistic image, imbalance is required for our growth. The Tree is dynamic, not static. It is a living representation of the way of evolution. The Tree exists within each of us as well as within every aspect of reality.[^1]

Today we cherish each manifestation of form – as well as force. We bless the form of physical sensation as we bromg it into the Compassionate Centre of **Tiferet**. We are grateful for the forms of sensation through which we experience ourselves in the world. In releasing our resistance to the evolution of these forms, they become more flexible, enabling the energies for our next expansion to more fully emerge.

<div class="abstract">

I am the Self through whom the Eternal One thinks, feels and speaks its Life in the world. As I become aware of the Light of the Heart within me, I feel a deep Compassion for all the ways we live in the world. The integrity of my own Being now unfolds with greater clarity and wisdom as I appreciate more deeply the physical sensations I experience.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<div class="note">

My friends, my children, brothers and sisters, the time is approaching. Just be strong. Believe in the Light of what you know to be true, and we will all meet in the next world, _Olam Ha'ba_, the world to come.

In fact, that is our actual journey &mdash; to achieve this next step into another way of being.

We enter naked into the world. We clothe ourselves &mdash; both our physical and mental bodies with much aid from our society. What we need to form and constrain are our emotions, which seem to arise on their own, and our thoughts &mdash; those that come from spirit.

Between form and force: The command is to manifest form, the true desire is to be of force. The duality of particle and wave has appeared. The force/energy being its true form, it needs to "form" &mdash; or be percieved as &mdash; a particle in order express itself to us. However, it will return to its true nature of energy as soon as it can.

---

When I say that I seek the truth, what truth is it that I seek? Is it my true heart's desire &mdash; or is it to nourish my soul with a relationship with the Divine. Whereas my hearts desire might appease my needs, it is not a relationship with G-d, but with myself that I am speaking of. Like the wave that can only manifest as a particle, we have free will and can take on many forms.

It is like opening your closet in the morning, and choosing your clothes for the day. Those that are suffering from real poverty may have only a single (or very limited) set of clothes to choose from to express themselves. Just as there are people who have only one form that they can manifest, indicating a real paucity of soul.

---

As a youth, what man do I envisage myself becoming? As an old woman, what forms can I take on? Perhaps the search for truth is to manifest of find those forms in the world that are truly you &mdash; accepting that they will change as you change.

---

Amen. My we all find our true hears desire and manifest it by becoming that form that supports our healing.

[^1]: I have to clarify something here. The Tree does not live or exist within or without each of us. It is a map, a representation of the dynamics of and between the various energies of creation and manifestation. The lower seven _sefirot_ are representative of the _Elohim_, as Steiner speaks of them in his book on Genesis.
