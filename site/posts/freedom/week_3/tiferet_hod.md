Compassion must include humility. May I remain humble and thankful to G-d in my compassion for others.

Into the _sefirah_ of **Tiferet**, the place of the Heart, we bring **Hod**, the ‘Glory’ of physical form. The symbolic place of **Hod** in the body is the left hip area, so the clear channel of Light today connects that area to your heart-space.

**Hod** represents the form needed to shape the energies flowing in from **Netzach**, enabling those physical energies to manifest as specific physical sensations in the world. On the Tree of Life we are continually challenged to match force and form, to balance the energies of expression with those of receptivity. One without the other cannot exist.

Yet if the force is too great for the form, the imbalance created leaves our energies spilling over aimlessly in the world. If the form is too great for the force, we experience the hollow of pretence.
True Balance is not achieved once and for all. Each new balancing leads to the next imbalance. According to the kabbalistic image, imbalance is required for our growth. The Tree is dynamic, not static. It is a living representation of the way of evolution. The Tree exists within each of us as well as within every aspect of reality.[^1]

Today we cherish each manifestation of form – as well as force. We bless the form of physical sensation as we bromg it into the Compassionate Centre of **Tiferet**. We are grateful for the forms of sensation through which we experience ourselves in the world. In releasing our resistance to the evolution of these forms, they become more flexible, enabling the energies for our next expansion to more fully emerge.

I am the Self through whom the Eternal One thinks, feels and speaks its Life in the world. As I become aware of the Light of the Heart within me, I feel a deep Compassion for all the ways we live in the world. The integrity of my own Being now unfolds with greater clarity and wisdom as I appreciate more deeply the physical sensations I experience.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

[^1]: I have to clarify something here. The Tree does not live or exist within or without each of us. It is a map, a representation of the dynamics of and between the various energies of creation and manifestation. The lower seven _sefirot_ are representative of the _Elohim_, as Steiner speaks of them in his book on Genesis.
