For compassion to be effective and healthy it needs to be disciplined and focused.

</div>

On this day of the journey we bring **Gevurah** into **Tiferet**, and the energies connect the heart and the left shoulder. The day is one of healing, for we take the _sefirah_ of Limitation and Judgement into the _sefirah_ of Compassion and Balance.

Into the Light of the Heart we bring the great Limiter, that which at once gives from to the flow of Love from **Chesed**, limiting its expansion that it might shape itself in a balanced fashion in this world. This essential paradox of **Gevurah** draws to it energies of fear and shadow. Today we shelter even that fear within the Light of Compassion.

We should not deny the shadow side of our own being. We cannot pretend that the problematic aspects of our existence and our struggles for awareness do not exist. We bring these struggles with us wherever we go. Our task is to find ways to walk with our fears as allies, to release the power hidden within them.

We need to bless that which is in most need of blessing. Creation unfolds through the act of blessing that which is.

We have all that we need to support the _Tikkun Ha-Olam_, the Healing Completion of Creation. The higher truth is that our experiences are absolutely fitting for each one of us. When we accept them, they are no longer forced to remain as they are; when we resist them, we keep them&mdash;and ourselves&mdash;from changing. On this day, we open to the emotional energies within us which are in need of blessing from our Greater Awareness.

<div class="abstract">

I focus on the Light in my own heart space, so that it can be clear. Into this Light I bring the energies of my feelings. All aspects of my life are illuminated with special blessing. I awaken to a deep inner Compassion from which I can heal and realise my essential wholeness.
