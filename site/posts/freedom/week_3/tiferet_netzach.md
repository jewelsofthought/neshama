<h4>ֵֵEnduring Harmony</h4>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

Is the harmony in my life enduring? Does my balance remain steadfast among other forces in my life? Do I have the capacity to keep balanced even when it's uncomfortable?

</div>

Eighteen is the number of life, _chai_, whose letters add up to 18. This day whispers to us of the deeper aspects of Life itself. **Tiferet** encourages us to be joyful for the steps we have already traversed in our journey from the limitations of slavery to the responsibilities of freedom. This journey is built on all our journeys of the past. Thus we now have the opportunity of reaching deeper than ever before towards the higher Vision that calls us from within the depths of our heart-space.

Our journey in consciousness must be reflected through our actions in the world. It is fitting that we connect today to the _sefirah_ of **Netzach**, the outpouring of physical energies. The connection of Light is experienced between the heart and the right hip. The place of our vital energy in the world is brought into **Tiferet** to be held in the place of Compassion. **Netzach** brings **Tiferet** the energy through which its Wholeness and Peace may extend into the physical world.

Our tradition insists that spiritual awareness needs to be translated into the material world. We are the beings who have the responsibility to awaken the world in which forgetting is more popular than remembering.

Bless the energies we are given to express this Heart of Compassion in our daily lives. We celebrate the connection of that which has been to the vision of that which can now be. We are more because of what has endured in the steps we have travelled, what we have learned about paths that enrich and others that impoverish. Our task is to risk the ways of expansion and evolution in our choices now.

<div class="abstract">

The Light of my Heart radiates energies of joy to all aspects of my mind, my emotions and my body. My Spirit is renewed by the illumination of the Vision carried by this Joy.  I am filled with the blessing from what I am becoming. I celebrate a new feeling of Spirit that stirs  energies of vitality in me.
</div>

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<div class="note">

May the Lord, G-d, guide the opening of the Light of my heart to radiate outwards.

**Hod** represents the splendour of form, while **Netzach** expresses the joy of force.
