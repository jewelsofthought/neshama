<div class="abstract">

For compassion to be realized, it requires a channel between giver and receiver. A mutuality that extends beyond the moment of need.  Ensure that something eternal is built as a result of your compassion.
</div>

On this day, nearing the end of the third week of our crossing, we bring **Yesod** into **Tiferet**. It is our ego identity which we bathe in the Light of Compassion today. Today, **Tiferet** receives the balance of Foundation within itself. The Light is focused on the central pillar of the Tree, from heart to pubis. The promise of this day is the balancing of our lesser and greater “I”, our exclusive and our inclusive identities.

Which “I” looks at the world at any given time determines much of what is received. If it is the smaller “I”, the one who is separate from all others, then it will be perceived in terms of competition, of winning and losing. If it is seen from the perspective of the larger “I”, the one who shares rather than competes, who has rather than needs, then a different reality will be perceived. I realise my self acting all parts in the drama, and glimpse the nature of the Dance of the Whole. What is really “out there”? It depends on who is looking.

We need both our greater “I” and our lesser “i”. The one is connected to the Universe of Being, and maintains our connection to this greater Light, reminding us who we truly are. The other ensures our biological survival on this planet, so that the Greater Awareness might be in this world.

Today focus on blessing that lesser identity in the Light of the greater I that lives within us. Bring all your feelings of separateness, the competition, and your fears into the Light. We do no seek to change the ego, but to appreciate it more truly. In order to do that, we need to relieve it of responsibilities that it cannot carry, and to support it in those it must. We wish to build a fitting vehicle for **Tiferet** to express itself in the world.

<div class="abstract">

The Oneness that exists within me brings blessing to all aspects of my being. The self I bring to the world is enhanced by the Self which connects to all Being. I am grateful for the gifts from my awakening Identity which I now share with others. I am one with all that is...

</div>

<div class="note">

**Alternate rendering of above meditation**

The oneness that is I and that reflects the Creator, holy is His name, awakens within me, bringing blessing to all aspects of my being and His creation. The self which he has gifted me is blessed by the greater Self, which is a piece of the Creator Himself, blessed be His name forever, which connects me to all Being, in  His Name. I thank you, O Lord, for the gifts that I reveive from my awakening Identity, which grows in relation to the most High Being, holy is His existence, and which I now realise I share with all others. Im am one with all that is, אהיה.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<div class="note">

<blockquote style="text-align: center">

"The finish line is for the ego.
The journey is for the soul."

</blockquote>

No longer experiencing the awesome wonder of the Creation, we are asleep. We awaken, either through our soul being jolted awake, or suffering sufficient pain that we begin to acknowledge that the universe is infinite and we each have a piece of that infinity existing inside ourselves. We need then to become nothing again, so that God can now clothe us (_Essential Kabbalah_ by Daniel Matt, p. 71).

Ego arises as part of growing, to protect and to define You (that is an expression of the Infinite Being.) It is **Gevurah** that creates the limits and boundaries to the awesome being you actually are. Thereupon we being to identify ourselves, and other begin, nay, actually encourage us to identify, to "create", our selves, the being we are going to become. Suddenly, we find ourselves in this place: we have become the vessel, the covering, we need in order to function in our society. We thus define our world by that yardstick by which we are accepted into the community surrounding us.
