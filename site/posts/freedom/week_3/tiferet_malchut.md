<h4>Receiving in Harmony</h4>

</div>
<div class="abstract">

For compassion to be complete (and enhance the other six aspects of compassion) it must recognize and appreciate individual sovereignty. It should boost self-esteem and cultivate human dignity. When I express compassion in a dignified manner it will reflect reciprocally in the one who receives compassion.
</div>

We conclude each week of our counting by bringing **Malchut**, the lowest of the _sefirot_, into the _sefirah_ of the week. This week we offer up **Malchut** to **Tiferet**, that this level of Kingdom might drink fully of the Compassion that illuminates the heart, and that **Tiferet** might bask the culmination of its energy.

We focus our energies on the central pillar of the Tree. The channel of Light passes between the heart and the base of the spine. As **Malchut** and **Tiferet** meet, we experience a special kind of inner balance.

**Malchut** is the _sefirah_ which symbolises the reality in which we all live. It receives its energy from all the other _sefirot_. But the vessel of **Malchut** is also the most complex, and those other energies are often hidden within it. Our challenge is to honour all those energies, that we might consciously evolve.

To truly bless **Malchut** in **Tiferet** is to recognise the perfection of all that manifests and that Perfection can only be perceived through the knowing that awakens at **Tiferet**. The only real control we have over the past is our attitude towards it, and that attitude drastically affects our present moment.[^1] To bring **Malchut** into the awareness called **Tiferet** nourishes the beauty hidden in all things on this level of reality.

Metaphysical literature often states that twenty-one days of creative meditation are necessary to alter a habit or a belief. We are now completing the first twenty-one days of this journey. We are becoming more aware of the energies within. These meditations are taking root within our consciousness. These days of our counting provide a context for Spirit to awaken within each one of us.

<div class="abstract">

My world is blessed this day in the Light of the Heart. The Compassion of <b>Tiferet</b> spreads through all levels of my being. I feel a new sense of balance between my inner and my outer vision. My world reflects back to me the One Who s It Life. I cherish the Spark of Being in all I meet.
