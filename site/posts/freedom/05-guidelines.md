These specific meditations are offered to encourage fuller awareness through a seven-week period. The weekly and daily sections that follow provide introductions to the basic energies. In the R' Falcon's text, he included space for personal reflections. As this is being transposed to the digital medium, we encourage comments, but for your personal use, you are welcome to download the page and add your own.

1. **Read the weekly meditation**
   each day of the week,
   with your weekly affirmations and intentions in mind.
2. **Read the meditation of the day**,
   repeating your affirmations (aloud).
   Add your own comments, thoughts and feelings.
3. **Focus on the part of the body** associated with the weekly _sefirah_.
   Imagine a sphere of light at that space.
   • Let it glow with the colour[^1] of that weekly _sefirah_[^2].
4. **Imagine a channel** within your body between the weekly and the daily _sefirah_,
   then bring the daily _sefirah_ into the _sefirah_ of the week.
   • You might imagine the colour of the _sefirah_ of the day within that weekly _sefirah_.[^3]
5. **Use the diagram** of the Tree of Life
   to help visualise the connections of the _sefirot_.
   Allow the energies (of the Tree/_sefirot_) to unfold through you.[^4]
6. Chant or **intone the vowel** sound of the _sefirah_ of the week
   (either the traditional or the alternative).
   • Create a chant using the letter of the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter Appellation of G-d, with the vowels of the weekly _sefirah_.
7. **Visualise the Name of God** associated with the weekly _sefirah_ of this process.[^5]
   Write the letters in Hebrew. Own them!
8. **Focus on the specific quality** of aspect of awareness represented by that _sefirah_.
   Consider that aspect of your experience.
   The tree is dynamic, always in motion. It is always balancing, unbalancing, rebalancing. The dance of the Tree is reflected in the worlds we know.
9. **Be aware** of your experience.
   Add your own words to describe what you are experiencing during this process.
   Engage with intention.
   Allow the energies of the weekly and daily _sefirot_ support your own regular meditations and prayers.
10. **Stay in touch** with others who might be sharing the process with you. Discover how you can support one another.
11. Approach this as **an adventure**. There is no way of knowing in advance what wonders, and what challenges, shall open up for you in these steps along the way from enslavement to freedom.

## Personal Reflection

I wish to comment on these guidelines. From personal experience of this process, I find that what you need to commit to in order to begin this journey is just to keep the count. That is the commitment that is primary. To add the daily reading to your count is fairly easy. It is like adding an extra supplement to your daily intake:-) Thus the first step is to count and read the daily meditation. Just go with the flow and note anything that you want or need to. That is covered in guidelines 1 & 2.

If you wish to incorporate some body work as well, then 3 & 4 are good guides.

Now, if you wish to delve more deeply into the energies of the Tree, guideline 5 with the diagram is where the study begins. However, more important than the connections at this stage, are the actual meanings (on all 4 levels) of the _sefirot_ and that is well covered in guideline 8. This is necessary before one can "allow the energies to unfold through you" – which is an advanced stage of evolvement (though I suppose the grammatically correct word is "evolution" – however, I feel it is an evolution that I am involved in).

The stages of chanting the vowel sounds (guideline 6) and visualising the name of G-d (guideline 7) are both deep and far more complex. The diagram is not sufficient to provide the guidance that is necessary to be able to benefit from these practices. I would suggest practising them in a group with a knowledgeable facilitator.

Guideline 10 is good advice – however, do not let that deter you.

Finally, 11 is excellent life guidance, and this adventure is good practice...

### One more sidenote

If you begin this journey during _Sefirat H'Omer_ period, step into the Tree from wherever you are in the Count. It is like entering into the middle of a dance or a song. You just join along. Well, if this is during that time, it is easier to swim with the current of millions of us who are seeking to find our way across the abyss from darkness to light, from bondage to freedom.

### Final note

As with all practices or journeys one takes, you will receive and benefit from the practice to the extent that you apply yourself and by the amount of energy and focus you give to the practice itself. You will only get out of it in proportion to the effort that you put into it.

As it says, "Pray with your heart and your soul", if you want G-d to hear you.

Blessings on you all.

[^1]: These colours are based on a recent exposition by R' Zalman-Shachter. I am unsure of their efficacy – though they sound nice, the explanation seems too rational.
[^2]:
    More importantly, if there is a colour/vibration associated with the _sefirah_, then it is about "vibrational" energy that is necessary to be attuned. The best way of doing that is via one's "feelings". Thus the attunement of that part of the body is done by focusing on the "energy/vibration" of that colour.
    What does it evoke in you? What does it feel like? How does it respond to that colour?
    [Journeys to investigate the colours of the _sefirot_ are possible.]{.note}

[^3]: Here again the process would be the intermingling or harmonising of the two energies. But first, it would be good to investigate the physical (or visual) interplays of the colours, before stepping into the vibrational aspect.
[^4]: He makes it seem so simple – but ultimately, this is a tool order. If even for a moment you can embody the energies of the 7 lower sefirot, if you could for a moment hold those energies in balance – like riding a multi-dimensional stallion – it would be a transformational moment.
[^5]: This is from Abulafia's method of Ecstatic Kabbalah, and is very popular amongst the renewalists. But it is advanced stuff, and still needs the foundation in order to be properly utilised.
