## The Tree of Life

The Kabbalistic Tree of Life, or _Etz Chayim_, is a symbolic representation of the ways Awareness unfolds from more subtle (vibrational) aspects to manifest as the density we experience as the physical world. It describes the steps through which Conscious Energy moves from the subtle to the denser vibrational levels to finally manifest in the physical forms we are familiar with. This "map of consciousness" provides a model for understanding the nature of All Being which is reflected in  the nature of our own particular being. The map aides us in understanding and appreciating all the available levels of existence, and serves as a foundation for our meditative journey. The path downward on the Tree is called the Path of Creation, or Emanation, and the path upward describes the Path of Spiritual Awakening, or Return.

The Tree teaches that the nature of "reality" depends upon the place from which that "reality" is viewed. From spaces of "higher" consciousness, Oneness is clear. From spaces of "lower" consciousness, there is clearly separation. It's the same "reality," perceived from different points of view.

It consists of ten _sefirot_, or levels of expression. Although early Kabbalistic writers visualised them as circles within circles, which was a perhaps clearer depiction of the multi-dimensional reality in which we exist,  by the Middle Ages they had taken the more familiar form of the Tree. This basic image suggests the human form, reflecting the notion that each human being expresses the entire Universe in microcosm

Each _sefirah_ has a specific energy, a characteristic aspect of the One Energy, and represents a necessary stage in the process through which the Absolute One moves toward manifestation.

By analogy, one might imagine that the Tree reflects the flow of electrical energy from the power plant to your home. If the power was directly connected to your house, it would immediately destroy not only all the wiring but even the house itself. So electricity flows from the power plant through a series of transforming stations in which its force is stepped down, so that it enters the home in a usable way.

Energy flows downward through each _sefirah_, reflecting in aspects of spiritual, intellectual, emotional, and physical (sensory) reality as appropriate. Each is also represented as an area of the human body, as a colour and as a sound. Each has associated with it one of the appellations of G-d, representing one of the aspects of Reality.

## The Basics of the Ten Sefirot

The Tree of Life represents a cosmic map describing how energy moves from its least physical state to its most physical. The _sefirah_, **Keter**, is the formless kernel of Consciousness. The journey from unmanifest to manifest[^1] passes from **Keter**, the Crown, through **Chochmah**, the vibration of Awareness, then through **Binah**, the form of an awareness (an idea), and then across the Abyss, the final gap between essentially unmanifest and essentially manifest, to **Chesed**, the vibration of Emotion, and to **Gevurah**, the form of emotion (or feeling)[^2], and then **Tiferet**, the place of balance on the Tree, the Individuated, Inclusive Awareness[^3]. From there, the flow, gathering at each level the essential nature of that level, moves to **Netzach**, sensory vibration, and to **Hod**, sensory form (sensation), to meet again at **Yesod**, the Foundation of individual identity. Each _sefirah_ below Keter receives from above and transmits below, until the final _sefirah_, **Malchut**, receives from them all. **Malchut**, the Kingdom, is the space in which the energies coalesce as the reality we experience[^4].

In this model of the Tree, the seven lower _sefirot_ hold energies for which we are responsible[^5]. Our meditations during this _Omer_ process are focussed on balancing these lower _sefirot_. The upper three _sefirot_ are prepared for us and are available according to our readiness to receive that greater awareness which is beyond our direct experience.

The colours and sounds are taken mainly from the teachings of 13th and 16th century mystics in Spain and in Safed, represented by Rabbis Abulafia, Moses de Leon, Joseph Gikitilla and Isaac Luria. Each _sefirah_ can be imagined as a sphere of light, within which are visualised the four letters of the unpronounceable Divine Name (_Yod-Khay-Vav-Khay_):

<h2 style="text-align: center" dir='rtl'>
יהוה
</h2>

These letters appear in the specific colour of the _sefirah_. Remember that Hebrew is read from right to left as you learn the shapes of these letters. This four-letter Name is not pronounced, lest we think it represents that which can be limited to word, concept, image or feelings.

Vowel sounds in Hebrew have long been associated with specific _sefirot_ and utilised as ways to meditate on the energies of the each _sefirah_. The sounds can be vocalised as extended chants, as the specific vowel signs are paired with the four letter Name of G!d.

## Learning the Ten Sefirot

The meditations in this book focus on the lower seven _sefirot_, following the traditional order applied by the sixteenth century kabbalists to the 49-day journey toward awakening. These are the levels for which we humans have greater responsibility. The upper three _sefirot_ become available to us as we balance the lower seven.

One of the lower seven _sefirot_ is assigned to each of the seven weeks of our journey. Within each week, each day is also assigned a _sefirah_. Thus every day of the process includes the major focus on the _sefirah_ of the week, and an additional focus on the _sefirah_ of the day. This will become clearer as you proceed to the actual meditations.

The goal is to balance the energies of these seven lower _sefirot_ during these seven weeks, but it is helpful to understand how all ten _sefirot_ function on the Tree.

The teachers of Kabbalah associated colors and sounds to the _sefirot_ to provide additional depth to the meditative experience. As a visualization practice, each _sefirah_ can be seen as a sphere of light (although the words "sphere" and "sefirah" sound similar, they are not related). The light at each _sefirah_ can be imagined according to its color.

The Names of God traditionally assigned to each week are meant as sounds and visualizations for _hitbod'dut_, or contemplation. Associating the particular Name of God at each _sefirah_ adds auditory dimensions to the image of the Hebrew letters spelling that name.

The Hebrew vowel sounds associated with specific can be vocalized or sensed in the silence of meditation as extended tones, and the specific vowels can be associated with the letters of the four-letter Name of God. For example, the chant at Keter would be "_Yee-Hee-Vee-Hee_". The four letters can be chanted on a single breath, or each letter can take up a breath, allowing a greater focus on letter and sound.

**Footnotes**

[^1]: It is interesting to note that this is how it would be described from the point of view of a manifest consciousness. For as it is only the manifest that we are aware of, it would seem that the journey is from the unmanifest to the manifest. However, the journey could possibly be far more complex, with the manifest only a stage in the full experience.
[^2]: Actually the form of the vibration of Emotion. Remembering that form is in essence trapped energy.
[^3]: It is the place of balance – between the emotions, the physical being and the intellectual.
[^4]: This is essentially where our place is, and our purpose is to transmit above, so as to complete the journey of the emergence of each _Sefirah_.
[^5]: These are the energies with which the manifested is imbued. Our responsibility is to use them to attain a place of higher awareness. To balance and harmonise these energies at play in our beings, just like the conductor of an orchestra must balance all the different instruments to make harmonic sounds that uplift us all to the heavens.
