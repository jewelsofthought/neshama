<h4>Endurance in Love</h4>
</div>

<div class="abstract">

Does my love have spirit and valour? Will I be able to endure and overcome the challenges of love? Will I be able to rise to the heights that love requires of me, without falling into the endless pits of love's opposition?.

</div>

We are still working in **Chesed** this week, breathing in and through the energies of loving which are called to expression. We are the beings charged with the responsibility of bringing heaven and earth together. Today **Chesed**, Lovingkindness, extends and connects more closely to the physical energies which will manifest as and in the physical reality in which we live.

**Netzach**, Victory or Reverberation, the _sefirah_ holding fully expressive physical energies, is brought into **Chesed**, the _sefirah_ holding fully expressive emotional energies. Feel the connection from the right shoulder to the right hip. The right side of the body is illuminated, radiating energies of Life and Love.

There is an eternal quality about the energy of this day, and we know this force is contained within every thought, feeling, and sensation. Prior to the limitations of particular form, all things are possible. So today we open to the awareness of that possibility in our own lives and in our own world.

<div class="abstract">

I open to experience the nascent emotional and physical energies which can fill me with new possibilities and purpose, through appreciating the gifts granted me. I trust that in blessing them, I will discover new and fuller ways in which to express them in my world, realising and accepting that there is unlimited energy available to me.
</div>
