<h4>Endurance in Love</h4>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem; font-style: italic">
<p>
Does my love have spirit and valour? Will I be able to endure and overcome the challenges of love? Will I be able to rise to the heights that love requires of me, without falling into the endless pits of love's opposition?.

</div>

We are still working in **Chesed** this week, breathing in and through the energies of loving which are called to expression. We are the beings charged with the responsibility of bringing heaven and earth together. Today **Chesed**, Lovingkindness, extends and connects more closely to the physical energies which will manifest as and in the physical reality in which we live.

**Netzach**, Victory or Reverberation, the _sefirah_ holding fully expressive physical energies, is brought into **Chesed**, the _sefirah_ holding fully expressive emotional energies. Feel the connection from the right shoulder to the right hip. The right side of the body is illuminated, radiating energies of Life and Love. All things are possible.
There is an eternal quality about the Energy of this day, and we know this force is contained within every thought, feeling, and sensation. Prior to the limitations of particular form, all things are possible. So today we open to the awareness of that possibility in our own lives and in our own world.

<p style="font-style: italic; margin: 2rem; text-align: justify">
I open to experiencing the nascent emotional and physical energies which I use to fill me with new possibility and purpose. Through appreciating the gifts granted me, which are now able to be expressed through me and by trusting that in blessing them, I will discover new and fuller ways in which to express them in my world, I realise and accept that there are  almost unlimited energy available to me&mdash;as long as I retain my balance and hold my centre.
