<p>Examine every aspect of love, its expression and its intensity. We all have the capacity to love, however to actualize and express it in a productive and positive manner is our work.</p>

Unless my love includes the other six aspects of <b>Chesed</b>, it will be distorted and unable to be truly realized.

The challenge is that stands in front of us before we begin our journey, is to choose freedom. With freedom comes truth. In slavery is the illusion, the pretence of life. The journey from slavery to freedom is filled with challenges, demanding that we release the chains that keep us stuck in our pain, those habits and thoughts that cause great pain. They keep us separate from realising our potential, convincing us of our limitations, our smallnesses. Our external slavery is a metaphor for the slavery we experience internally.

The paradox of slavery is that it is safe. There is security in being able to blame the external world for the challenges I experience. There is safety in someone else making the decisions, of not having to take responsibility for the choices you make in your life.

Each day of our counting we focus on two _sefirot_, two energy levels of the kabbalistic Tree of Life. Today we begin our journey with **Chesed**, the _sefirah_ of Lovingkindness, of Emotional Energy. This first day brings **Chesed** into **Chesed**. Focus on the sphere of light at the right shoulder, releasing this Energy of Expansive Love.

Freedom opens us to the choice to expand. I am free to choose how to live, free to change myself and through my choices, change my world. However, with greater freedom also comes greater responsibility, demanding that we become more aware of the Energy we all carry. There is an awesome quality to this freedom. We are able to respond more fully to ourselves, to one another and to the world.

In this way, the Omer Journey becomes a metaphor for our personal journey from the confines of a place of self-delusion to the wonder of renewed self-creation. This is the task to which we are called by our Tradition. The life of this Universe calls each of us to experience the fullness of our own life. In this way we participate fully in Creation itself.

<div style="font-style: italic; margin: 2rem; text-align: justify">
I step beyond the safe confines of my slavery now. I am filled with the energies of Divine Love, that I might journey with greater purpose and meaning. A deep inner security replaces my dependence on external circumstances, that suppress change. Instead I allow this deep Loving to support my growth.</div>
