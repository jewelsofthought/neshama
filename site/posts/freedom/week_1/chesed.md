Love is the single most powerful and necessary component in life. Love is the origin and foundation of all human interactions. It is both giving and receiving. It allows us to reach above and beyond ourselves. To experience another person and to allow that person to experience us. It is the tool by which we learn to experience the highest reality – G-d. In a single word: love is transcendence.

<h3 style="text-align:center">Mercy in Love</h3>

I take moments of quiet each day this week to appreciate more fully the nature of my experience. I allow myself to expand into the omnipotent and abundant flow of Life behind each feeling I find. This week I embrace the abundant outpouring of possibility.

## The Sefirah on the Tree of Life

**Chesed** is the _sefirah_ on the Tree of Life where the energies expand without limit. **Chesed** is also known as _Gedulah_, which means “largesse” or “greatness”. It is the place in which the energies express only mercy through unconditional giving. It is love that always gives, just like the Sun that always shines upon everything on earth, the tall and the short, the good and the evil.

**Chesed** represents the unlimited flow of energy as it flows down from the Divine Realms, undifferentiated, neither positive nor negative, preceding any polarity. This is the Impulse behind both the light and shadow at **Gevurah**, the basic principle reflected through each of the three pairs of _sefirot_, **Hod** and **Netzach**, **Gevurah** and **Chesed**, **Binah** and **Chochmah**. The _sefirot_ of force, on the right side of the Tree express energy before it separates into the polarities brought about through particular forms or specific expressions.
This first week of the journey we focus on opening ourselves to receive from the Fountain of Life, and to be nourished.

**Chesed** presents an abundant flow of that which is not yet differentiated into specific feelings.

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 130%">
The Name of G-d<br />
at <strong>Chesed</strong><br />
is <em>El</em>,
<h4 style="font-size: 200%">
אֵל</h4>
</div>

Traditionally, _El_, which basically means G-d, reflects the Universal attributes of Compassion and Mercy. At **Chesed**, Mercy represents the ever-flowing, ever-providing, ever-sustaining energy of unlimited abundance and possibility. _El_ offers Itself without reservation, and in that sense is truly Merciful and Loving.

Each feeling we experience is itself a shell containing the unlimited flow of Divine Energy. Open yourself to the abundance of that offering, beginning the journey to experience more fully the Fountain of Life that is always available to us.

## Meditation for the First Week at CHESED

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
וְאַתָּ֣ה אֲ֭דֹנָי אֵל־רַח֣וּם וְחַנּ֑וּן אֶ֥רֶךְ אַ֝פַּ֗יִם וְרַב־חֶ֥סֶד וֶאֱמֶֽת
</p>
<p>

And You, Eternal One, are _El_, full of Compassion, Gracious, Long-suffering and Bountiful in Lovingkindness and Truth.
-- (Psalm 86:15)
</p>

We begin without a clear image of where we wish to be. From a place of bondage, it is not possible to know the Promised Land. _Mitzrayim_, as the ancient kingdom of Egypt, represents our enslavements, both internal and external. The true slave is the one who believes in his enslavement, and thus his enslavement becomes self-enslavement. In order to find freedom to express what we are, we need to believe in the message of freedom. As long as we are caught in the in negative statements, whether self-to-self or self-to-other, and negative messages about the world, we remain slaves in _Mitzrayim_, which manifests as a place of stuckness.

From this place of limitation, this place of contraction, it is not possible to know the goal which appears only through self-expansion. Every time we think we know from the level of our difficulties the answer to our problems, we discover the resolution to be preciously short-lived.

Our journey thus begins with **Chesed**, the _sefirah_ of ever-flowing, over-flowing, energies of life. This week in **Chesed**, we honour the energies with which we are nourished.

<div style="font-style: italic">
<p>
I acknowledge the abundant outpouring of possibility this week.
</p>
<p>
The Universal Energy awakens prior to the limitation of form, beyond definition. This Energy is the force that is the impulse contained in each feeling. The greater the feeling, the greater the Energy it contains. But there is no feeling great enough to contain that Energy. Each feeling can only hold a piece of it. Feelings of acceptance, of compassion, and of love, contain the fullest energy.
</p>
<p>
I acknowledge all my feelings this week, honouring the energy they contain. I embrace the energy of each feeling, with the feeling of that energy behind all awareness.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<div class="note">

I am the channel through which the energies of the Creator of the universe, blessed be His Name, flow. I am aware of His potential within me to bring blessing. Today my physical energy are nourished by the Spirit of Love which is the manifestation of **HaShem**'s compassion and mercy,  May His Name be remembered forever.
