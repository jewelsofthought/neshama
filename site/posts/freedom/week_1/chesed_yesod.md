<p>Connection in Loving</p>

For love to be eternal it requires bonding. A sense of togetherness which actualizes the love in a joint effort. An intimate connection, kinship and attachment, benefiting both parties. This bonding bears fruit; the fruit born out of a healthy union.

The sixth day of Omer focuses on the _sefirah_ **Yesod**, Foundation, in **Chesed**. **Yesod** is centred in the loins and represents the ego identity in all its glory and all its limitations. This area of body and this aspect of self are today challenged to open to the energy of Love symbolized by **Chesed**. The right shoulder and the genitals are connected by a channel of radiant light.

We need the ego to support our survival as a separate entity in the world through which we can express the energies which are available to us. But that ego easily forgets that which gives its existence depth and meaning and imagines it is able to achieve that all by itself.[^1]

**Chesed**, the _sefirah_ of Lovingkindness, needs **Yesod** to express its energies in the world, and **Yesod** needs **Chesed** to remember the true Nature of its being. All the _sefirot_ are interdependent. The world needs all ten to exist. Each _sefirah_ represents an essential aspect of the Creation process, just as each represents an essential aspect of the process of spiritual awakening.

**Chesed**, the centre of Lovingkindness, is exactly what your ego needs to remember. So this day is one of great significance. This is the place where we can find the balance that we need for the next stage of our journey.

<div style="font-style: italic; margin: 2rem; text-align: justify">
All that I am is Blessed by the Divine energies of Light. Even my sense of separateness begins to open to this blessing, remembering that I am more than I can ever know. Through whatever difficulties I face, I remember that the world is speaking to me out of Divine Understanding. Through every cell of my being this Loving energy awakens, enabling me to perceive with greater clarity the One Whose Presence is everywhere and everything. As I recognize the Life that flows through all being, I express this life through fuller awareness of myself and acknowledge its presence in all beings. From today I recognise the Life which flows through all and everything that exists, both in me and around me.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

[^1]: Indeed the ego cannot experience anything that is beyond the ego. One has to reach for some other aspect, some other part of one's being to become aware of this otherness that is the reason and cause of its very existence. Something that is humbling for this arrogant ego.

Could the idea of separateness affect the Infinite Oneness? Of course not. However, are we not essentially the expression of the One's "idea" of separateness, and thus we are born with this idea embedded in ourselves. Our sages say that that is our work in the healing of the World (and perhaps G-d Himself), to overcome this separateness, and return home to the place of Union with the Divine Itself.

**Some vague thoughts on the matter**:

Male lingam points up.
Thrusts upward -> toward higher conscionsness, the heavens.

Female “thrusts” downward, expression of the "negative" of the upward thrust, becoming in essence a thrust outward. Its expression as a receptacle for earth’s energies. For in order to receive, has to be a “negative/relatively empty” space.

In the Feminine expression, the energy is drawn inward (the process of reception) and, the female absorbs it and, in the positive female, it is then transformed to form – as in the birth of a child. Which is, in the balanced female, a masculine expression – a giving.

There is a similar process for the Male. In order to receive, in the Masculine expression, the energy is thrust outward (the process of giving), which then empties the vessel, and, in the positive male will be able to able to receive (feminine).

If this process of giving/receiving is blocked, the energy is transformed into waste energy, which generally generates heat and friction i.e., violence.

The female absorbs, receives, and in that way, blocks/holds the energy
She is earthbound – anchored to form, her nature to nourish the growing forms
Babies and children are a horizontal expansion
