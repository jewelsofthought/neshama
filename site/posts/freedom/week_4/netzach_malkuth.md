We are four weeks into this journey, travelling through wilderness that marks our passage from slavery to freedom. Our slavery binds us to the World of our Being. We embarked upon this journey so that we might hear more clearly than ever before the Word that sparks our Freedom.

This week of **Netzach** draws to a close as we connect the _sefirah_ of Physical Energy to the _sefirah_ of the Kingdom, **Malchut**. Each week draws the energy of the Tree into a new balance, and each week concludes with **Malchut**, the tenth _sefirah_ on the Tree of Life which represents the place in which we are born to this life we are presently experiencing.

**Malchut** is the confusing and marvellous world of space and time in which this journey takes place. It is here that we have the opportunity to manifest our energies in support of our awakening to the true depth and purpose of our existence. This day **Malchut** infuses and is infused with the physical energies of **Netzach**.

The grounding of **Malchut** is available today to **Netzach**. All the _sefirot_ of the Tree of Life are waiting to manifest through Malchut. All our meditations, our visions, and our dreams await their realisation in the world we know at **Malchut**. Our goals seek to meet us where we already are, as we awaken more fully than ever before to the wonders of the present moment.

**Netzach** itself is offered its own piece of the reality of **Malchut** on this day. The Light joins **Netzach** at the right hip with **Malchut** at the base of the spine.

The manifestation of the fulfilment of the energies of speaks of the enriching influences of the Vitality of Physical Being in the world.

<div class="abstract">

My physical energies flow freely into my world now. I act with renewed purpose and vitality through the vision of a world that speaks of the Wholeness and the Life that is its Source. I am the vehicle through which the world takes shape.
