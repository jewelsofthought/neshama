_We have the capacity to endure much more than we can imagine, and to prevail under the most trying of circumstances._

Today we bring the _sefirah_ of **Netzach** into the week of **Netzach**. Our focus is on the right leg and the _sefirah_ represented here radiates especially fully now. The physical vitality that manifests as sensation and perception is awake within us.

**Netzach** this week has received the influences of expanding Lovingkindness, the Limitation of emotional form, and the balance of Compassion. All this contributes to our awareness now of Physical Energies waiting to be expressed.

There is such potential in this step of the journey. We are pulled from our weariness and infused with increased vitality. With this energy comes renewed possibility. Our task is to recognise and value those energies without limitation, before form. That will come tomorrow.

The evenness of our breath at **Tiferet** quickens now. We are breathing in new energies. There is a freer movement in the body, a recognition of greater strength than ever before. We achieve this by opening to the reflection of **Netzach** in the world within us and around us.

Old limits of Physical Energy are now released. In this realm all things are again possible. There is no end to the life-enhancing flow at **Netzach**. With curiosity and with wonder we become aware of the energy that energizes our physical being today.

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem;">

_There is a quickening of Vitality within me today. Every cell of my being reverberates with the fullness of life. A new excitement is mine as I become more aware of my world. I welcome the reflections of this vibration everywhere. I breathe more fully the vitality of Being, and await the forms it will encounter with excitement._
