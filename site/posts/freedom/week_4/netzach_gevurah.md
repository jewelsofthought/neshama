This is the second day of the week of **Netzach**, the week that focuses our energies at the _sefirah_ of Physical Force. On this day we bring **Gevurah** into **Netzach**, experiencing the flow of Light between the left shoulder and the right leg.

To express our energies creatively, they need to be given form, even though that form always limits their possibilities. **Gevurah** is the great limiter on the Tree. As such, it draws to itself names like Judgement and Severity. It is seen as the place of “evil”, because of its potential for creating forms too rigid to change, as well as forms which hide an emptiness inside.

Yet **Gevurah** holds the key to all the expression of the One Energy. So we bring it into **Netzach** gently, that it might help (in)form our physical existence in truly fruitful ways. **Gevurah** holds the secret of true receptivity, which provides the means for what might, without it, be the proliferation of unusable energies.[^1]

Often in our lives our own energies are in need of more productive forms. We exhaust ourselves without it; our energy scatters in all direction, and we manifest little.

We welcome **Gevurah** as blessing into **Netzach**, yearning to bring proper form that we might continue the great process which we call Creation. At this point in our journey it is not possible to know what forms will be appropriate for our greater learning and our greater sharing this year. We allow ourselves to trust that the proper forms will emerge as we hold ourselves in an attitude of gratitude.

<div class="abstract">

I welcome the flowering of my physical energies this day. With deep and easy breathing, my energy is renewed with the Light of vitality. I trust the proper forms will emerge to enable me to share my vitality in deeply creative ways. I celebrate the energies which flow through me every day of my life.
