_The compassion of endurance reflects a most beautiful quality of endurance: an enduring commitment to help another grow. Endurance without compassion is misguided and selfish. Endurance needs to be not just loving to those who deserve love, but also compassionate to the less fortunate._

The blessings of this journey expand as we become aware of the ways the One Creative Consciousness expresses Itself as our universe. The ancient tradition called Kabbalah renews itself through our own meditations. Kabbalah is an expanding tradition, and in our growing we add to its teachings. As we open more fully to the nature of our own Being, we are better able to participate in a greater healing and celebration of Wholeness.

Into the energy of **Netzach** we bring **Tiferet**, becoming aware of the Light connecting the right leg and the heart-space. We seek to bless the expansion of Physical Vitality with the balance of compassion at **Tiferet**. Each expansion of physical energy enables new opportunities to express Compassion more fully in the world of experience.

We are not accidental beings in this place. We are the vehicles in which Spirit awakens on this level of Creation. Our responsibility would be greater than we could bear were it not for the profound Compassion and Love which is available to us to support our task.

Now this Compassion has become more infused into our own energy. From deep within us, an inner integrity speaks strongly of the Way. We are not to simply repeat the deeds and thoughts of others who have travelled this path of awakening, but need to actively discover the act which is uniquely ours&mdash;the words that are waiting for us to speak, the thought that is waiting to be born.

_The Heart of all Being vibrates within me. A greater Awareness guides the expansion of my own vitality, imbibing my energies with a clarity that enables me to more deeply appreciate the meaning and purpose to my journey. I unite with all around me in creating a life of Peace and Harmony. I begin to find greater harmony with the rhythms of my Life and the Life that vibrates all around me._
