<i>Day Five of Week 4:</i> 
<p>Humility in Ambition</p>

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem; font-style: italic">

Yielding - which is a result of humility - is an essential element of enduring. Standing fast can sometimes be a formula for destruction. The oak, lacking the ability to bend in the hurricane, is uprooted. The reed, which yields to the wind, survives without a problem. Do I know when to yield out of strength not fear?

Endurance is fuelled by inner strength. **Hod** of **Netzach** is the humble recognition and acknowledgement that the capacity to endure and prevail comes from the soul that G-d gave each person. This humility does not compromise the drive of endurance; on the contrary, it intensifies it, because human endurance can go only so far and endure only so much, whereas endurance that comes from the Divine soul is limitless.

Upon awakening, by thanking G-d for providing you, a soul, with the extraordinary power and versatility to endure despite trying challenges will allow you to draw energy and strength for the entire day.

**Hod** enters the week of **Netzach** with its gifts of Perceptual Forms for the Vital Energy that have been building. The channel between the left and right leg is alive with Light.
**Hod** forms **Netzach**'s expression, so each is required for Creation to take place. It is the “Glory” of physical form appropriately reflecting the energies it receives. We now recognize the unfolding beauty of the forms with which **Netzach** is now blessed. We also witness these forms in other beings.

There is a tension between **Netzach** and **Hod**, for in their communication true balance is difficult to achieve. In fact, each perceptual form, while containing the energy of **Netzach**, tends to close itself off from further flow. The flow of Energy yearns to be held in the form of a sensation, and then longs to be released.

Energy contained too long in any shell loses its freshness, loses its connection to source. We seek to enable the form to respond naturally to that which it receives, so that we might avoid both excessive limitation or the creation of hollow shells of pretence.
The dynamic interplay of Energy through the _sefirot_ becomes more "real" as it moves downward. Our bodies are forms in which the Energy from **Netzach** is realized. As this life-giving flow becomes more available, we become more aware of our health and wholeness. Our cells drink fully from the offering of **Netzach**, responding with new expansions and definitions of self.

We begin to understand the dynamic of the Tree of Life as form expands to contain the greater energy it is given. **Hod** within **Netzach** allows the special fulfilment of the _sefirah_, and there is celebration.

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem;">

_I am aware of the perfection of Physical Form, the sensations and perceptions that expand to contain the wonders of the energies of Life received. I am part of a glorious adventure of Spirit seeking to manifest Itself in continually expanding ways. With deep confidence, I allow myself freedom to move in directions that flow from my own integrity. I celebrate all form through which I perceive Spirit growing._
