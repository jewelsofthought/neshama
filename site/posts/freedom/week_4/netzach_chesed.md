<h4>Kindness in Perseverence</h4>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

For anything to endure it needs to be loved.

This is the beginning of the fourth week of our journey. Our focus moves down the path of the Tree to **Netzach**, the seventh _sefirah_. **Netzach** is the place of physical vitality. The One energy has translated through the mental and emotional realms to reach this place. **Netzach** begins the realisation of energies in more concrete manifestations. The work of Creation continues.

The _sefirot_ are now more familiar to us. We recognise their names, and their energies. We begin to feel them awaken as Light energy within our bodies. We are more aware of the emotional as well as the physical aspects of their unfolding. Now we can begin to understand the greater dimensions of meaning in their order and significance.

On this, the first day of the fourth week, we bring **Chesed** into **Netzach**, blessing the physical sensation with the expansive emotional energy called Lovingkindness. Our challenge is to realise and balance all the energies of the Tree as they move downward into manifestation.

We are on the right side of the Tree today, the side of force, joining the Light at the right hip to the Light at the right shoulder. We more fully experience the incredible energies that are ours to channel and express.

This day infuse this physical force with Lovingkindness. Be aware of these energies moving through us that will ultimately awaken as our physical experience in the world.

<div class="abstract">

I am a channel through whom the energies of this Universe flow. I focus on their potential to bring blessing. Today my physical energies are nourished by the spirit of Love which is their source. I receive the fullness of this offering, that I might grow and better know the Life within me.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<div class="note">

"Kindness in Perseverence" is an example of the multi-dimensional aspect of all of these interactions. It is also referred to as "Kindness in Ambition", reminding us, that even when we are focussed on our ambitions, to be kind to those around us.

Kindness is also mercy, the expansive dynamic. Thus it also means kindness towards oneself, in allowing oneself to be ambitious and want to achieve great things in your life.

Here are some of the complimentary opposites that we become aware of:

- Outer/Inner
- Expansive/Contractive
- Giving/Receiving
- Force/Form
- Power/Potential (Contained) Energy
