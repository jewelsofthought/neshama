<h4>Kindness in Receiving</h4>

<div class="abstract">

Healthy sovereignty is always kind and loving. An effective leader needs to be warm and considerate.

We begin the final week of our counting. It is the week of **Malchut**, the tenth _sefirah_. **Malchut** is the Kingdom, representing this world in which all the energies of the Tree of Life converge and manifest. According to some Kabbalistic formulations, this is the _sefirah_ of _Shechinah_, the indwelling Presence, the feminine aspect of God's Oneness. This is the material world in which the spiritual awaits realisation.

**Malchut** is the place in which we play out our earthly drama. We are born into this Kingdom much as we are born into our bodies. Our purpose here is to realise Who we are, that we might contribute to the completion of Creation in this realm.[^1]

Into **Malchut** we bring **Chesed**. We bring blessing from the place of Lovekindness into the lower _sefirah_ which is so in need to that Love and Blessing. The Light today connects the base of the spine and the right shoulder.

In **Malchut** there is so much confusion. It is so difficult to tell exactly what is going on. The days of this week attain special importance as we seek to perceive the manifestation of higher energies in this material world. In some ways, **Malchut** is the most crucial _sefirah_, since it is the "place" we live. **Malchut** provides the ground for Creation to manifest. **Malchut** is the _sefirah_ where the Presence can be met.
We are challenged to discover the Light within a world of light and shadow. So we begin this week in **Malchut** with Lovingkindness.

Lovingkindness infuses my world now. Its gentle Radiance illuminates all levels of my universe. Through that Light, I celebrate all Life about me. My world is blessed with Love.

Lovingkindness infuses my world now. Its gentle Radiance illuminates all levels of my universe. Through that Light, I celebrate all Life about me. My world is blessed with Love.

I realise more fully than ever before the worth of my separate self. I feel the blessings of Love awaken within me now, and know that there are new ways in which I can express this Love in my world. I am grateful for this opportunity to honour the individual expression of self in me and in all whom I meet.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

[^1]: I would have thought the the very process of being born into the body, of embodying form, would be one and the same with the "spiritual" birth in which we are playing out this drama.
