<h4>Victory/Success in Receiving</h4>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

A person's dignity and a leader's success is tested by his endurance level. Will and determination reflect the power and majesty of the human spirit. The strength of one's sovereignty.

How determined am I about reaching my goals? How strong is my conviction to fight for a dignified cause? How confident am I in myself? Act on something that you believe in but have been tentative about. Take the leap and just do it!

</div>

Into this week of **Malchut**, today we bring **Netzach**, the _sefirah_ of Physical Vitality. The channel of Light is experienced between the base of the spine and the right hip.

**Malchut** contains a confusing array of energies. Dealing with our world tends to deplete those energies. **Netzach** is the _sefirah_ that infuses our world with the Physical Endurance we need to continue on the final steps of our journey. **Netzach** is the corrective to the energy drain we experience both personally and globally. It is the breath, flowing freely and fully, revitalising the cells of the body of this Kingdom.

**Netzach** manifests as well in Physical Vibrations that serve to further confuse us in this realm. We need that which **Netzach** offers us to appreciate this energy for its own sake behind any forms in which it appears.

Our task on this day is to discover and honour those energies wherever we find them. We are challenged to affirm those forces even when they frighten us with their intensity. Only in this way can we grow to utilise them most effectively, and disperse the clouds of physical depression beneath which we so often live.

<div class="abstract">

I accept that the energies that now flow into my world, knowing that they vitalise all that is. New vitality is available to me now in my awakening to these shared aspects of my Being. I will focus on sharing these energies more fully with my world.

</div>
