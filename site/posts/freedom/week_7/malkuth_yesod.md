<h4>Connection in Receiving</h4>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

Examine the bonding aspect of your sovereignty. Healthy independence should not prevent you from bonding with another person. On the contrary: self-confidence allows you to respect and trust another's sovereignty and ultimately bond with him. And a bond will strengthen your own sovereignty, rather than sacrifice it.

</div>

We are engaging the energies of the _sefirot_ as they flow into **Malchut**, the _sefirah_ of this final week of this Omer journey. Into **Malchut**, this Kingdom, we bring **Yesod**, the place of our ego. **Yesod** is the Foundation of our lesser 'i' with which we interact with each other and with our world. The channel of Light is experienced between the genital area and the base of the spine.

It is possible, all too possible, to exist at **Malchut** without ever awakening to **Yesod**, eventually forgetting our fuller ego-self. The ego itself is an awakening of self-consciousness, without which we live with no perception of purpose beyond the fulfilment of material needs, and meaning beyond the identification with role, person or pattern in **Malchut**.

Ego is a link between our Higher Self and this world. With its light and its shadow, its joy and its sorrow, its yearnings and its accomplishments, its failures and its victories, our ego allows us to stand firm in the world. It is our vehicle for orientating thought, feeling, and action toward greater purpose.

With all its struggles, all its difficulties, our lesser self carries its own wisdom and power into the world of **Malchut**. It allows our unique point of view, through which we can understand and operate in the world with insight and with vision. Today, we seek to more fully awaken this self within our Kingdom, that we might be able to see our own responsibilities more clearly than ever before.

Our identity at **Yesod** is called _nefesh_, our animal soul, yet it has great possibilities. Only through the _nefesh_ can we make sense out of the **Malchut** we encounter. Let us seek to honour that identity, and celebrate its energies in our world. It is the space in which we first open our "i's".

<div class="abstract">

Within my world, I awaken now to a fuller appreciation for my individual being. I am filled with a new sense of my own integrity and uniqueness. I am more available than ever before to realise the One Source of all Being who experiences the world with me.
