<div class="abstract">

A good leader is a compassionate one. **Tiferet** - harmony - is critical for successful leadership. In an area where you wield authority  polish it up and increase its effectiveness by curtailing excesses and consolidating forces.
</div>

Into the weekly _sefirah_ of **Malchut** we bring **Tiferet**, the _sefirah_ of Beauty and of Balance. **Tiferet** is the space of our Greater Self, the “I” with which we perceive our connection to all Life. Within this identity our awareness expands, and we are able to know the Compassion which brings blessings to all it experiences. The channel of Light connect the base of the spine to the space of the heart.

Our world, **Malchut**, is yearning for these blessings. It is our responsibility to convey them here. In the up-and-down, high-and-low fluctuations at **Malchut**, we ride the roller coaster of feelings. We touch great heights of joy and plunge into lows that often seem deepest when our joys have been the highest. We seek Compassion which can help us see beyond the moment of darkness to perceive the larger rhythms of which we are a part.

**Tiferet** brings the Heart into this world. It carries the Light that can serve to remind us at those moments of darkness that there is more, that we are more. **Tiferet** carries the feeling of Deep Acceptance, and it is acceptance of the here and now that can lead us beyond any apparent impasse.

Since **Malchut** is our Kingdom, we are now working with the actual experiences in our own lives. So we would do well to consider our own space of darkness, and dare to realise Light awaits us right here where we are now. This Heart energy expands our vision to see enhanced possibilities. We are called upon to dream the dreams of growth, particularly at moments when growth seems impossible.

<div class="abstract">

Beyond the confusion and doubts that I experience, there is an inner Light waiting to be perceived. From that Light, I hear the gentle flow of Compassion which fills me now with the whispers of blessing behind all the events of my life.
