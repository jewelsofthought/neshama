Take a moment and concentrate on yourself, on your true inner self, not on your performance and how you project to others. Be at peace with yourself knowing that G-d created a very unique and special person&mdash;which is you. Never forget, you could not have created this being that you are without G-d’s help.

This is the final day of this journey. Forty-eight days ago, we began our journey out of bondage, enslaved by the material world. We arrive now at the brink of the Mountain, where we are to receive the Word which demarcates the space of our existence, and marks our awakening.

Today, we focus our energies at **Malchut**. This is **Malchut** in **Malchut**, the Grounding of the entire Tree of Life. We are here, in this world of countless wonders. This is where we must realise the energies of the Tree. This is the space in which and for which we have responsibility. The light radiates at the base of the spine.

We are challenged to be true to ourselves and to our world, to perceive our own unfolding uniqueness, while maintaining our integrity and authenticity in a world full of difficulties and confusions. This journey was a journey of discovery. To seek and discover the traces of all the _sefirot_ which are hidden in this realm. We are the beings who can recognise the sparks which are hidden in this place, that We and Creation may expand through this hidden consciousness.

It is not always easy to know our own uniqueness. There are so many voices that live inside us and around us demanding that we conform to models fashioned by others.

How are we to know the way which is right for us at this moment? How are we to realise our own integrity? Perhaps by pausing long enough from our hectic lives to find out how we are really thinking, feeling and sensing our reality. To release the “should’s” from the “ought’s” long enough to meet ourselves and so to unfold through our own honesty. By daring to announce and accept ourselves as we are, that we might then be available to our world and to ourselves. We already are the One we need to be.

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem; font-style:italic">

I release the tensions that keep me from being fully present in my world. I become available to the inner whisper of direction as I accept myself and my world. I am ready to stand with my People at the place called Sinai. **I am ready to hear the Word that supports my World**.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<div style="font-size: 80%">

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; text-align: center">Torah Unites</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem">

<p>We Jews are a diverse people. We speak many languages. We live in every part of the world. We have different cultures, foods, political views.
But when a Jew’s mind is absorbed within Torah, it is the same Torah within which another Jew is absorbed. And another Jew. And yet another.
We discuss and debate and share and challenge and discuss yet more.
Until all of us become one in mind, soul and body, within one grand conversation of an endless Torah.</p>
