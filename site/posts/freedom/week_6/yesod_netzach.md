<i>Day Four of Week 6:</i> 
<p>Endurance in Connection</p>

<div class="abstract">

_An essential component of bonding is its endurance. Its ability to withstand challenges and setbacks. Without endurance there is no chance to develop true bonding._

_Demonstrate the endurance nature of your bonding by confronting a challenge that obstructs the bond._

Into this week of **Yesod**, the Foundation of our being in the world, we bring **Netzach**, the reverberation of Physical Energy. The channel of Light connects the pubic area with the right hip of the body.

We allow our lesser self to be revitalised by **Netzach**, that it might acquire the to express its uniqueness more authentically in the world.

The ego, our sense of separate self, is the precious identity in which we live most of the time. Our task is to create an ego able not only to support our own emerging self, but also those around us.

We seek to avoid the trap of simply comparing ourselves to some external model, and instead reach deeply inside to discover our own truths. At the same time, we need to mindful of the search of others. We are not meant simply to replicate one another, but to co-exist and cooperate with honesty and with caring. It takes great courage to be able to bring ourselves into the open.

This courage flows from **Netzach**. Our energies are renewed and deepened. We allow ourselves to feel this revitalisation through every cell of our bodies. The exhaustion of our journey lifts. There is now strength to move ahead.

We particularly honour the Vitality which allow us to create a self worthy of the Self Who lives in us. Today gives us space to appreciate the fuller strength of our individual being.

_Today I am filled with new vitality and Spirit. A deep self-acceptance allows a new flowering of awareness now. I am at peace with the world._
