_Love is the heart of bonding._[^2] _You cannot bond without love. Love establishes a reliable base which allows bonding to be built on. If you have a problem bonding, examine how much you love the one (or the object) you wish to bond with. Do I try to bond without first fostering a loving attitude? Is my bonding expressed in a loving manner? Demonstrate the bond you have with someone through acts of love._

This week we focus our attention on **Yesod**, the place where we awaken as individualized beings in the world. This is the centre we call “ego”. The One Being individualises Itself on this level of existence. The cost of individualisation is the awareness of separation.

Into this space of separateness we bring **Chesed**, with its energies of Lovingkindness, to begin the sixth week of our journey. We imagine the connection as a channel of light between the genital area and the right shoulder.

**Yesod** is the centre identified with sexuality because that is symbolic of our biological selves. Ego is that identity with which we survive as individual biological entities in the world. Our challenge is to support the growth of ego without expecting it to engage in tasks and take on responsibilities which are beyond its abilities.

It is through ego that we present ourselves in the world, that we relate to one another, and cooperate in the ongoing process of Creation. Ego is a channel through which energies from higher levels of our Tree can reach into ordinary reality. We strive to honour this aspect of our identity, to strengthen it, and to support other egos around us.

Ego often seek to claim the universe as its own, to see itself as the centre of all existence. This posture of egocentricity leads great personal and global suffering. Extreme self-involvement shuts out others and is a mockery of the spiritual path. So we bring **Chesed**, Lovingkindness, into **Yesod** to support the more loving and fluid expression of this ego-identity.

_I embrace more fully than ever before the worth of my separate self. The blessings of Love awaken within me now. I know now that there are new ways in which I can express this Love in my world. I am nourished by honouring the individual expression of self in me and in all whom I meet.

[^1]: “Be kind in your relationships”; “Make connections that are kind, and not angry or devious”; ”Treat those you are connected to kindly”.

    Love is the heart of bonding:
    This is one of the 4 spaces of bonding. This should be expressed more clearly in the movement of **Yesod** through the _sefirot_.
    But because we are only dealing with the lower 7, the body, we do not experience the Upper, the spiritual engagement., which is expressed as “Impulse from below.”
    **Physical**: Lust/physical desire is the bond (**Malchut**). Here it is expressed in pure giving (masculine) and receiving (feminine) terms. Both are valid (and necessary). Only Love can lift us (and this) to a higher level, where the giving and the receiving are hormonious and balanced.
    **Emotional**: Love is the bond (**Yesod**) – **Netzach** & **Hod** have to be balanced.
    **Intellectual**: Balance/Harmony is the goal (**Tiferet**). Melding of minds. Bonding through a common vision, shared beliefs. .
