<h2>Malkut she’b Yesod</h2>
<i>Day Seven of Week 6:</i> 
<p>Receptiveness in Connection</p>

</div>

<div class="abstract">

Bonding must enhance a person's sovereignty. It should nurture and strengthen your own dignity and the dignity of the one you connect with. Emphasize and highlight the strengths of the one you bond with.

</div>

We experience our journey unfolding whenever we choose to walk. That which was so distant grows closer. We are six weeks from our place of enslavement. We are on our way to the place of freedom.
This has been our week of **Yesod**, focusing on the energies of the ego, of our lesser self. On this final day of this week, we bring **Malchut**, the _sefirah_ representing the Kingdom, into **Yesod**. The channel of Light connects the lower _sefirot_ on the central pillar of the Tree of Life, the pubic area and the base of the spine.

**Malchut** is the final _sefirah_, into which all the energies moving through the Tree of Life finally flow. Those energies of each _sefirah_ are no are no longer quite so distinct as they are at their “place”, but they are available to be discovered within **Malchut**.

**Malchut** is where all this happens. It is the place within which, and from which, we are given the opportunity to awaken. It is the place of slavery, and it the place of freedom. This is the wonderful Kingdom of Possibility.[^1]

**Malchut** is the _sefirah_ which grounds all those above it.[^2]. In electrical systems, without a suitable and stable “ground”, the current cannot flow fully and clearly. So it is with the system called the Tree of Life. We need a stable grounding to allow energies on the entire Tree to flow fully and with purpose. **Malchut** provides the environment in which we can stand. **Malchut** today brings that reality into **Yesod**, the Foundation of our sense of separate self.

<div class="abstract">

I feel the energies of a Universe flow through me now. I am a channel through whom heaven and earth meet. My journey grows clearer as I celebrate the blessings of my separate self. I act to translate these blessings to all those around me

<h3>Reflections</h3>

[^1]: **Kingdom of Possibility**
jjjj
    Is it for us to experience joy & bliss, happiness and health here? I do not believe so. It is for us to work for G-d – for the greater cause offered to us by the Creator of the Universe! That is the beauty of being human. We are here to do work – which the others beings are just that – just being. So we can choose to remain in slavery, and thus human, or to rise to the challenge of embracing the Divine being who has created us and everything in existence&mdash;and expressing His Will in the Kingdom which he has created for us to do our work!

    How could we fall so deeply into the darkness of believing that the ultimate purpose of all of creation was to own a car, or a house, or make more money, or have lots of sex?
    Could you really believe that this whole show was just for us to sit like an audience at the movie, and eating popcorn and enjoying the movie?

    I mean, some of us at least, wake up to the fact that this is an incredible place we live in, this universe. It is like a treasure trove of life and experiences. We are given to enjoy these experiences, but are we taking the cover for the book? How many of us open the book and read what is inside? How come we assume that we know anything of what is written in that book if we have never opened it?

    It is like racism, or anti-semitism – hating someone or something you have never met, nor have any experience of.
    That is mental slavery, following some one else’s opinions.
    We need to stop being fooled into this illusion of separateness. We are not part of the Universe. We are the universe having a universal experience. We are involved in the Universe having an experience of the Universe. We are not separate from IT. We are IT – for it is, in essence, ONE.
    That is the most basic and fundamental concept to grasp and internalise.

    IT IS ALL ONE.

    And not the one that we count. One apple, one dollar, one person, etc. But the One that describes an absolute Unity, a perfect Perfection. Can you truly imagine that? Can you embody that in any part of your life?
    Good Luck, and G-d Bless.

    Y”mba.

[^2]: _"**Malchut** is the_ sefirah _which grounds all those above it. In electrical systems, without a suitable and stable “ground”, the current cannot flow fully and clearly. So it is with the system called the Tree of Life. We need a stable grounding to allow energies on the entire Tree to flow fully and with purpose."_

    This is an incorrect analogy. Firstly, current can flow fully and clearly without a ground. Grounding is necessary for excess energy, if something happens to the circuit.

    However, continuing to use this analogy correctly, it would speak of the completion of a circuit. In order for a current to flow, you need a giver and a receiver, the negative and positive poles. In the full Tree of Life, the giver is actually **Keter**, and the receiver is **Malchut**. One could amend this to speak of the six as potential energy, building up of the energy, which when connected with **Malchut** – in other words switching on the circuit – the current will flow – which is the expression of your life – you as a living, conscious being.

    What we receive is awareness and some control of that switch. It is similar to the need for a partner, as the “switch” that will turn me on! Unfortunately we think that the same one that turns us on sexually (physically) will be the one to “switch” on our soul energy too.

    Thus, **Malchut** does not ground us. It completes the circuit. We need grounding in the Tree of Life, the system, and its appelations, in order to deal with the excess and wasteful or negative energy that we produce. That needs to be actually grounded in the earth of our existence – which is the earth itself and the bedrock of our spiritual faith, if it too is grounded.

    The interesting aspect that this brings up, is that if you fill your six _sefirot_ with negative energy, then your giver will be negative, and the flow will be lessoned. (Remember, in the world of electricity the convention is that electricity travels from negative to positive – mainly because the electron is rated as negative (because of the proton that exists in the nucleus). My point on is that it is a convention used to describe the dynamics of electricity. However, as with most things, in the spiritual world it is different. The channel is from positive to negative. However, whether you call it positive or negative is irrelevant. The point is that there is a difference of energy, and the flow is always from the abundant to the lack – which I call from the positive to the negative – or from credit to debit. For there to be current, there must be an energy difference.Though interesting enough, in the realm debit and credit, debit means that the money has actually flowed through it already. It is almost like creating the future by spending energy that which doesn’t yet exist.

    **Malchut** as the receiver, has to be empty. In order for her to be empty, she cannot be holding unnecessary things in that space. That is generally because of emotional connections in that inner place of being. We can use techniques like the shaman safe-place journey to clear that space.

    The more difficult work is to ensure that all the other six _sefirot_ are functioning at optimum capacity, so that the potential energy (which is actually the energy that is available for use by the system – which we know to be infinite, and – for the span of our life time – is always being made available to us in some measure).

    And this is the work we do in this Journey of the Omer and its Blessing.
