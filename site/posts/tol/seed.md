## Personhood

        If we wish the system to be about people, then the basic unit, the seed, of the system has to be the individual.

If this individual is to have any autonomy, he
must have an id within the system. This id should identify him or her as a person, and not as merely another part of the system.

This identification must allow or provide the individual with some a private, sovereign space in the system. Otherwise, he or she just becomes another brick in the wall, and becomes, in
essence, an IT.

Bringing us to the concept of **personhood** in cyber space.

We should have control over that personhood and the data contained IN that "person" as he or she is represented and interacts in cyber space.

## Seeding

I have been trying to build the tree from the top down, starting at the root and spreading out from there. The actual way that it needs to be expressed is each individual as a seed, that grows into a tree, that becomes a forest... connecting to all the other "forests" out there.

The health of any forest is determined both by the health of its trees, that is the health of its members, and the environment in which they grow. As well as the environment around the forest, with the climate, the rain, and the other factors that sustain a healthy forest.

It is said that in healthy forest ecosystems, they will communicate events between one another... and the receiver will begin to react to this information.

In human terms, the individual is the seed, he (hopefully) grows into a healthy adult, who becomes a productive member of his community, which (hopefully) co-exists in a symbiotic manner with the communities around.

## Actor

The central figure in our drama is the actor. The whole purpose of everything we do is based around this actor - you, the individual person.

In order for this actor to deal with the surrounding world (real or virtual) he or she has to have a space once called sacred, but nowadays referred to as one's "safe space", rather than my "sacred space".

Let us represent this interaction with the world as a egg-shaped ellipse. Thus we have the following picture.

In the real world we all interact via this "outer" shell. We might see it as our body, our persona, or whatever. But it is expressed through a learnt behaviour. It is with that behaviour that we set out into the world, adjusting our reactions and our strategies along our way.

In the end, we can only hope that - irrespective of circumstances&mdash;we manage to eventually get it right.

## Voluntary

There are some things I know I cannot control, and thus seek external forms of control.

External control is oppression, ruled by power, controlled by fear. The higher expression of that is service to a higher cause or sublimating one's individual desires to the greater needs of your community or family. If this comes from one's internal control, then it is true. Else it is through external or other influences, and it is controlled by someone else.
