## Together We Stand

> The highest form of giving is when the giver is unknown and the beneficiary is unknown.

It is time for the sleepers to awaken. For years we have been lurking in the shadows, looking, watching, participating, but seeing its faults and becoming more and more distant from this absurd theatre. These bombastic leaders of our societies, playing a game of their making, while the people shudder in dread at the fear of having no food and shelter. Millions suffer deprivation while trillions are spent are vapourware.

Their weakness is two-fold. The first is their rigidity, and the second is their need for (centralised) control. Thus, naturally producing a rigid, vertical economy.

Thus we must be like the water, and move like the wind. We appear where we are needed, and then disperse back into the shadows. We do not need to be known. We do not seek fame, our names heralded across the banners of the globe.

There is work to be done, and we the engineers, and designers and visionaries of the world, wherever you are, and whoever you are, need to begin to do the work.

The essence of the path has to be sharing and collaboration. Together we stand, divided we fall.

## Seeding

I have been trying to build the tree from the top down, starting at the root and spreading out from there. The actual way that it needs to be expressed is each individual as a seed, that grows into a tree, that becomes a forest... connecting to all the other "forests" out there.

The health of any forest is determined both by the health of its trees, that is the health of its members, and the environment in which they grow. As well as the environment around the forest, with the climate, the rain, and the other factors that sustain a healthy forest.

It is said that in healthy forest ecosystems, they will communicate events between one another... and the receiver will begin to react to this information.

In human terms, the individual is the seed, he (hopefully) grows into a healthy adult, who becomes a productive member of his community, which (hopefully) co-exists in a symbiotic manner with the communities around.

## Actor

The central figure in our drama is the actor. The whole purpose of everything we do is based around this actor - you, the individual person.

In order for this actor to deal with the surrounding world (real or virtual) he or she has to have a space once called sacred, but nowadays referred to as one's "safe space", rather than my "sacred space".

Let us represent this interaction with the world as a egg-shaped ellipse. Thus we have the following picture.

In the real world we all interact via this "outer" shell. We might see it as our body, our persona, or whatever. But it is expressed through a learnt behaviour. It is with that behaviour that we set out into the world, adjusting our reactions and our strategies along our way.

In the end, we can only hope that - irrespective of circumstances&mdash;we manage to eventually get it right.

## Voluntary

There are some things I know I cannot control, and thus seek external forms of control.

External control is oppression, ruled by power, controlled by fear. The higher expression of that is service to a higher cause or sublimating one's individual desires to the greater needs of your community or family. If this comes from one's internal control, then it is true. Else it is through external or other influences, and it is controlled by someone else.
