This is the gate we have also to pass through. Just as it says that G-d made many worlds; just as there is a quantum theory that speaks of many worlds, and other dimensions, we have the rise of many human cycles of existence &mdash; similar to the rise and fall of empires.

At the end of each cycle, a certain amount of people will heed the call and they manage to pass through the portal before it closes. They will remain to teach and plant the seeds for the new cycle.

What little we know or hypothesize regarding the previous cycle &mdash whether Hoovids, Atlanteans or any other &mdash; the only glimpse we have is of the "end" of those civilizations. We have little idea of their history, of how they lived, or anything of their demise. Nor do we know what, if anything, of their knowledge, what they built and what effects they have had upon our evolution. We can only surmise that they did in fact exist. But had they existed, I am certain, if they reached a high level of sophistication, that they were able to find a way to carry the seed(s) of their wisdom to another darker, and more primitive, era that would follow such a major wiping out.
