## Mandala of being

Every day I build a day of action, drawing a mandala of being in the sands of time. Each night, during my sleep, I dream, as it is erased. The next day, I begin building a new mandala of existence.

“But things remain after I go to sleep that are still there the next day? Like the house I live in, my family, friends, my work, etc.”

"Yes, those are your specific representations of the archetypes, and elements, that make up our daily lives. Their essence remains the same, but each one is different for each one of us. While sleeping we are unaware of our house, our families, etc. Upon awakening we re-connect to these representations that are still in our lives&mdash;whether we wish to or not. Just as these mandalas with their symbols tell a story, you, with your house and family, have a story to tell.

## Emotions

It might be easier to envisage this mandala as a mandala of emotions. Each day upon awakening, you will produce a different mandala of emotions – even though those emotions might only come from a limited range of such emotions&mdash;which we might term feelings or colours.

## Thoughts

Then we have that strange tapestry of your thoughts. Where do they come from? Can I claim all of them as my own? If each day you are thinking the same thoughts, then, I’m afraid, you might be caught in a loop, a kind of groundhog day – even if they are lovely. This kaleidescope of flashing thoughts, many of which flit by before you can even register them, changes from day to day too – even from moment to moment. And our mental realm is full of its archetypes and symbols too.
