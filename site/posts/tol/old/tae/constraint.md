### How: Constraint

> What action is necessary to implement this shift?

Instead of creating, constaintly seeking expansion, we need to learn as a society, a nation and a community to practice constraint.

In any relationship of sharing there is a giver and a taker. One could say a loser and a winner. That is how energy flows. If the recipient uses all the energy to produce or maintain something productive, all and good. Waste, however, is energy that is not utilised. If he hoards the energy, then it is not being used, and becomes toxic - for he will be collecting "waste" energy. If he (the recipient) has used his energy well, he will have regained his strength, and will be able now to become a giver... That is how the circles are completed.
