### What: Truth

> When we dehumanize, we are not in truth (since the truth is that each human being is a divine soul, is life itself, is a feeling, thinking subject with a unique experience of the world). When we are not in truth, we are vulnerable to lies.
> A movement that sees the world through a polarizing lens is prone to schisms itself.
> My message here is not to automatically trust everyone. Trust can come from a new foundation: I trust those who demonstrate a willingness to release their identity as good and right.
> Charles Eisenstein - <i>Sacred Economics</i>

> What structure will support that?

The only structures upon which that can be built will need to have their foundation, their {[axis mundi](axis_mundi.html)}, built upon Truth.

If the structure is an expression of the Oneness of being, and everything that we are able to perceive and communicate with is dealt with wisely - we will find the road to fulfilment.

The only way to root this idea in the world is through prayer, meditation, clear think, knowing that Truth is the chisel with which we engrave this concept.

> "You may ask, what is this Truth that you speak of? You talk of it as if it is some sort of absolute truth. We all know that truth is relative, especially in a fluid universe. Tell us of this Truth."

> "This Truth that I speak of is also not static, yet it holds a position relative to the object/event that is under observation. and is (measured)[measurement.html] by its distance from what is **really** happening - something we can never be fully aware of. In other words, any perception of the event is only partial. This is because we firstly only see a small segment of the totality of any event, and secondly, because we can only perceive & comprehend an event after it has occurred and if we have the appropriate means of measuring the change so as to be able to register said event.

> The Truth is the event itself, which cannot be discussed in relation to its truth or falsity, for it is simply the event.The Truth as "truth" that we can comprehend&mdash;which essentially means fit it into our narrative of being&mdash;expresses itself subsequent to the event itself. That is the "reality" of the occurrence&mdash;according to our perception. It is in after the event has actually occurred, in the imaginarium of our minds, that we begin to cohere what had just occurred. As time passes, that memory, also fluid, is influenced by some of the factors that arise subsequently. Yet as it morphs, to the narrator it is still the sworn truth - as far as he or she is concerned, and there is little that will dissuade said person.

> Judging outcomes, truth will always triumph&mdash;for it is the foundation of all occurrences, as the expression of the "natural" forces of the universe. Although slow, each one of Truth's steps are true! Whereas lies flit around like a butterfly on cocaine, always seek peace, but never finding a place to rest, for it has to constantly feed and maintain the lie(s). If it ceases for one moment, all the lies will come tumbling down like a house of cards. It has no source of its own, except the truth, that is its nemesis, and it will use truth, together with strategically placed lies, to its advantage. Thus, of utmost importance, is to be able to have some way, some criterion, some protocol, to enable us to discern between truth and lies.

> Yet how can one do that if one very parents lie. If one's teachers and leaders lie. Where is truth hiding?

> Brother, and sister, friend and foe, know that truth is never hidden. As we say, "He" hides in plain sight". For the event is the event, and the truth of the event stands as straight and firm as the shortest line between any two points. Everything else is an approximation, and the closest approximation, the truest rendition of the event itself, will, in truth, always triumph.

> Lies plays dirty - which one should always except from a low-life like that. It is the name of his game. And of course, we, even if we are truthsayers, need him, so that we can better hone our ability to discern the Truth, helping us to be maintain clarity of the distinction.

> Remember this simple truth: lies cannot hide the truth. They can only blind us to the truth. Like an illusionist, they seduce us to look at what they are presenting - and not what is really going on behind their backs &ndash; so as to speak.
