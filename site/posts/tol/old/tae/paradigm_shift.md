The new paradigmâ€™s lack of rootedness requires a system of communication and organisation which will enable it to embed itself in the current reality, in order to implement the environment and relationships for a better future to emerge.

We cannot continue to do the same things and expect a different result. In order for our situation to improve, there needs to be a fundamental shift that requires a systemic change.

There are many versions of what this shift will look like, what it will be, where it comes from and perhaps even to what it is to become.

From static, absolute, empirical view of objects that are time-invariant, to looking at events that are constantly becoming. That is, trying to find a local balance, or dynamic harmony within the greater system, and the local system. From a view of the universe that is static and absolutist, to [one that is fluid, dynamic and relative](/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/).

## Characteristics

### How: Constraint

> What action is necessary to implement this shift?

Instead of creating, constantly seeking expansion, we need to learn as a society, a nation and a community to practice constraint.

In any relationship of sharing there is a giver and a taker. One could say a loser and a winner. That is how energy flows. If the recipient uses all the energy to produce or maintain something productive, all and good. Waste, however, is energy that is not utilised. If he hoards the energy, then it is not being used, and becomes toxic - for he will be collecting "waste" energy. If he (the recipient) has used his energy well, he will have regained his strength, and will be able now to become a giver... That is how the circles are completed.
