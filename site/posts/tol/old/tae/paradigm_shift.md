## The Message

> It is a message that we hear, a sound that attracts us, that builds into a voice. A voice that speaks as loudly as the sound of the _shofar_ blast at Mount Sinai, yet as silent as electricity, with an impact as overwhelming.

> It calls upon us, again and again, to walk a certain path. If we do not listen to this silent voice, we will most likely encounter some form of disease&mdash;a place in which one has has no peace.

The new paradigmâ€™s lack of rootedness requires a system of communication and organisation which will enable it to embed itself in the current reality, in order to implement the environment and relationships for a better future to emerge.

We cannot continue to do the same things and expect a different result. In order for our situation to improve, there needs to be a fundamental shift that requires a systemic change.

There are many versions of what this shift will look like, what it will be, where it comes from and perhaps even to what it is to become.

From static, absolute, empirical view of objects that are time-invariant, to looking at events that are constantly becoming. That is, trying to find a local balance, or dynamic harmony within the greater system, and the local system. From a view of the universe that is static and absolutist, to one that is fluid, dynamic and relative.
