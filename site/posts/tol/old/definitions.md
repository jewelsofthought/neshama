## New Paradigm

A new paradigm requires a paradigm shift.
This requires fundamental changes => changes in ideology

## Patterns of behaviour:

There exist representative examples/patterns of underlying theory/viewpoint.

## Manifest

Manifest the structure that is already here... Just waiting to be born!

- For a shared purpose,
- For a common goal,
- With a communal vision.

Create/manifest a structure that will enable us (the people) to collaborate in creating system, as sustainable as possible. A system that has the characteristics/qualities of human-centric, heart-centred, earth-conscious paradigm.

This we will do by connecting all of us - stand up - who want to live in this, a new world, which we have to manifest and build - Olam Ha'ba - through a web of connections by which we can collaborate and support each other in creating the structure to empower the members and the network as a whole.

## Affinity

- spontaneous/natural liking/attraction
- recognition of structure (unless on a path to freedom from a certain structure).
- isomorphic - similarity of structure/topology/characteristics (spiritual distance)

### Affinity group

- Group of people linked by common bond.

Upper - common ideal/purpose/goal...
Lower - common material needs

## Associate

- **Connect** in mind
- **Join**/combine for a common purpose
- Partner, agreement
- Meet frequently, be friends,
- **Joined** in companionship, function or dignity
- In some group or category (as in "affinity group")

## Commit

- Perpetrate;
- Pledge; involve; bind;
- Morally dedicated, politically aligned
- **Obliged**

## Combine:

- Join;
- unite (purpose);
- possess together;
- coalesce (one).

## Co-alesce

- (parts) come together to form one whole

## Connect

- Join - 1 to another, 1 + 1
- **Associate** - mentally or practically, in communication with
- Be synchronous with - (trains)
- Unite/associate with others (in rel. etc)

[*] Form logical sequence; be meaningful.

### Connected

- **Joined** (in seq),
- Coherent (ideas),
- Related/associated.

### Connection

> Act/state ~; instance of this;
> Point of ~

- Thing/person that connects
- Link/relationship/association
- Arrangement/opportunity catching a train)
- [elect current ~; device ~]
- Relationship/association with ~s
- Relationship of ideas; context
- Religious body...

## Co-operation

- Work/act together

The principle of complimentary opposites; as in: "the compliment to". Each 'side' needs the other 'side' to exist. Can you have a beginning without an end? Can you have an up without a down, or a liberal without a conservative; a revolutionary without a system to revolt against?

## Co-ordinate

- Bring to proper/required relation to ensure harmony amongst the diverse parts for effective results.
- Work/act together effectively;
- organise, classify;
- equal in rank/importance/status.
- Co-llaborate:
- Com-munity

The idea of "co-ordination" requires diversity. Homogoneity is basic to harmony. In fact, a certain level of homogeneity is required for harmony - even if it is just in all agreeing to the goal at hand.

Many of the definitions fit. Is that an aspect of looking at this idea as enhancing the present system, not of destroying it and erecting something in its place.

## Join

- Put together, fasten, unite
- Become a member of
- Take one's place with/in
- Come into/share company of
- Take part in, participate
- Become **connected**
- Continuous

## Oblige

- constrain, compel;
- gratify, perform service for.

### Obligation

- constraint,
- duty,
- binding agreement

## Structure:

- set of interconnecting parts of a complex framework.

## Sustainable

Able to be maintained at a particular level

### Sustain -> Sustenance

- Support, bear weight of,
- give strength to, encourage,
- give nourishment to,
- endure, stand, bear, up against,
- undergo, suffer,
- uphold, decide in favour of,
- substantiate, corroborate,
- maintain, keep going (sustain a note)

## Synchronicity

> Simultaneous occurrence of events (which appear meaningfully related, but have no apparent causal connection.

## Unite

- Join together; make/become one; combine;
- Possess (qualities,...) in combination with;
- form whole.
