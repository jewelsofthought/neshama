### Economics

There are many communities already in existence, as well as many that would like to take this step and live within a community that supports them. The jump to the next step, that of a functioning web of communities dedicated to living a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle in active support and communication with one another, could be fairly swift.

With $1m, we should be able to set up a community consisting of 20 people, 10 of whom will focus on supporting the land, its system and needs, and 10 of whom will work on the network.

This could be done in a country like South Africa, where the amount needed by participants is around $1000 per month. The purchase of a piece of land, either with the necessary infrastructure and systems in place, or to upgrade/install them, would take around $500K. At $240K per year support for the 20 members, we would have approximately 2-3 years of money-freedom within the community.

If we assume that the community will begin to be productive within the first year, then that amount will be reduced, with the goal of being financially self-sufficient achieved by the third year. With the support of the emerging Tree of Life network this should be easily attainable, as the purpose of the network idea will be to support/provide most of the community’s needs.

In this period of transition, there will be those who cannot join a community because of other commitments/reasons, yet are in agreement with the goals of the network. They participate by providing energy/funds or products/items that are needed by the community.

If they are willing to give a tithe to the network, either in money or in energy, these communities will, no doubt, soon be well supported.
These communities are only moneyless within the community. Because they will be arising in the current system, they will still need to relate to the surrounding world in which money is a determining factor. One could say that internally the communities are moneyless, but externally they will still be bound by money.

Drawing from all the cultural creatives – those who are aligned with the goals and dreams of this network – who number in the millions, we anticipate a large number will see the benefits of the network and will join and support our efforts.
