1. [Anonymity of Identity](#anonymity-of-identity)

## Anonymity of Identity

Each person’s identity will be anonymous, represented by a digital identity. He/she can also have an “avatar” or “handle”, just like the computer, which has an IP address and a human readable hostname. All information regarding their identity will be handled in a similar fashion to the DNS in the realm of the internet – a well-researched topic. The root server houses all the information regarding the top (or “root”) domains of information. However within each one of these domains there are subdomains that contain all the private information. In other words, there is a lower level “root” server that houses all the information about its domain, but only a small, necessary part of it is available to the greater domain. This process continues on inwards. An example is a university, with departments; or a corporation with branches: within those branches there could be various departments.

The information archived in the network will follow a similar model.
