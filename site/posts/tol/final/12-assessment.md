### Core Values

A guiding principle of the Tree of Life network will be "for the benefit of the people" who are directly affected by the decision, as well as those that comprise the network and the network as a whole. Because the network is a local network, with a more global reach, the wider spread macro-effects are taken into account as well.

A requirement of joining would be to agree to the core principles of the network. These values can be embedded as a smart contract, and included in any transactions that take place in the network, expressed via the crypto-currency that the network will use.

### Trust and Insight

Trust has to be built up over years of interaction, and if a person, or group, has a hidden/personal agenda, one can only hope to reduce the space in which this may occur and to react swiftly and appropriately.

Transparency is necessary to induce trust. By using a block-chain technology that will record all transactions and events associated with any communication and action on the network, a trail will exist to track probable paths as well as an historical record in the case of investigation.

Any aberrant behaviour will be noticed, as all records have to be agreed upon by the affinity group as well as all of those that were involved in the transaction. This will increase the difficulty of introducing a falsity early in the history of the transaction. There will also be monitoring systems in place that will track for inconsistencies in the collection of records. Something like a spam or spyware filter that "learns" to recognise inconsistent responses.

### Flexibility

Flexibility arises from the fact that the network, while having an "oversight" capability, is essentially a network of communication, not governance. The purpose of the network is to connect the various groups and communities. Besides co-ordination and communication, people will organise themselves in the necessary groups to carry out the required tasks.

### Protection against the Abuse of Power

It is very difficult to protect against abuse of power, particularly if there is someone charismatic enough in the network to be able to persuade large groups of people to behave in a certain fashion.

One method to guard against abuse of power is by dissolve the project trees that emerge to deal with specific issues once the job is complete. Unless it is driven by a hidden agenda, or other hidden influences, there should be no issue or need to continue beyond the initial purpose in the same format. Another is the existence of a group that will oversee the project from cradle to grave, acting as the liaison between the network itself, the particular constituency affected by the project, and the project team.
Another safeguard is the full transparency of all communications and transactions that take place within this project tree. By monitoring trends and patterns much could be gleaned, and some early signs of abuse of power or power ascendency could be spotted and rectified. Rather than squash it – as it obviously arises through an otherwise unexpressed need – a better option would be to redirect the issue in question towards more positive effect.

Undue influence or meddling in the affairs of others is something that can also be recognised early by having all records open to perusal. If trustworthy people are in power/governing, these abuses will not occur. However, any system is only as trustworthy as those who are running it. A "trustless" systems using blockchain technology is one possible solution – and it can easily be applied to the Tree of Life network. If not, there is still transparency, some oversight agencies and their integrity, to rely on – similar to the present day dilemma.

### Accountability

Due to the pervasive and persistent access of records, any person or task can be called to account. This is the most obvious way of executing accountability. With an oversight group, and any individuals or groups who are interested in the outcome or history of any person or project, accountability will be relatively easy to evaluate.
