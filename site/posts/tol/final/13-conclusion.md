### Conclusion

In conclusion, I would like to say that this is a work in progress, but we are heartened and encouraged by the appearance of much of the technology and technological ideas needed to support an idea of this complexity. This can be confirmed by a quick perusal of the plenitude of initiatives that are trying to sprout or have begun in the arena of blockchains.

Technology's effect on us is determined to a great extent by the hand that wields it. The only way to change this seems to be to initiate a new structure with perhaps different core principles, a new constitution, that will allow and enable greater participation and thus ultimately of greater benefit to humanity.
