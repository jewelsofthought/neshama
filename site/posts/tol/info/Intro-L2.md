## Law of the conservation of mass

            the mass of the products (overall) always equals the mass of the reacting substances

## Atomic number and Mass Number

[Atomic Number and Mass Number](https://shaunmwilliams.com/IntroChem/lecture2.html#slide-14)

- Atomic Number (Z)
  - the number of protons in the nucleus of an element's atom
  - is generally found on the periodic table above the elemental symbol
- Mass Number (A)
  -the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an element's atom
  is generally found below the elemental symbol on the periodic table

- Neutron Number (N)
  - the number of neutrons in the nucleus of an element's atom

An [isotope](https://shaunmwilliams.com/IntroChem/lecture2.html#slide-15) of an element is an atom that contains a specific number of neutrons.

An [atomic mass](https://shaunmwilliams.com/IntroChem/lecture2.html#slide-19) unit (amu) is equal to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom.
