Imagine the effect of bad water on your body, and possibly your mind. Let us assume that the water is not toxic, but just "off", and does not have an immediate effect on the body, but has been drunk for many years. Water is a source of information, as it is a major transportation medium carrying all sorts of chemicals and other detritus on its journey. It is also the main ingredient of the blood that courses through our bodies, nourishing and cleansing the cells as it does. It is also electromagnetically sensitive, and will change according to the energy environment it is in. However, it is not only a transportation system, it is also a communication system. Because of the very fact that it transports things to (and from) the body, it is communicating on many different levels. Depending one what the water carries from the environment into our bodies, a body would have to deal with the "information" that is being transported into the it. It is also used as a major indicator of the state of many organs and processes in the body, as it would carry the evidence of these things as well in its purpose as the carrier of the all the waste &ndash; in fact of most of what is generated in the body.

If the water is full of life and the energy of our environment, it will transfer much of that into the body. But if the water is overprocessed, kept in storage, delivered via pipes, and itself containing extra chemicals - like flouride and chlorine - that are in one's environment, each one will affect the water and thus communicate its effect to the body itself. Chemicals that we take in the food like sugar and salt (and many others) will cover and override the more subtle energy that would be communicated to the body under more natural circumstances.

Even emotions can affect the state of water, as has been shown. Plus we have seen the effect that music and vibrations have upon water as well.
