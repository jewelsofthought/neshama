## Economics

With $1m, we should be able to set up a community consisting of 20 people, 10 of whom will focus on supporting the land and its system and needs, 10 of whom will work on the network.

This can be done in a country like South Africa, where the amount needed by the participants is around $1000/mth. The purchase of a piece of land, either with the necessary infrastructure and systems in place, or to upgrade/install them, would take around $500k. At $240k per year support for the 20 members, we will have about 2 – 3 years of money-freedom within the community.

If we assume that the community will begin to be productive within 1 year, then that amount will be reduced, with the goal of being financially self-sufficient by the 3rd year. With the support of the emerging Tree of Life, this should be attainable, as the idea will be able for the Network to be providing most of the community’s needs.

I predict that if we have 10 people working on the network, that we could soon have at least 100 communities participating.

In this period of transition, there will be those who cannot join a community because of other commitments/reasons, yet are in agreement with the goals of the network. They participate by providing energy/funds or products/items that are needed by the community.

If there is sufficient support from the greater network, so that we can receive funding we could have a network of these 100 communities, having become self-sufficient within a reasonable timeframe. If they are willing to give a tithe to the network, either in money or in energy, these communities will, no doubt, soon be well supported.

Our communities are only moneyless within the community. Because they will be arising in the current system, they will still need to relate to the surrounding world in which money is a determining factor. One could say that internally the communities are moneyless, but externally they will still be bound by money.

Drawing from all the cultural creatives - those who are aligned with the goals and dreams of this network - who number in the millions,[^9] we anticipate a large number will see the benefits of the network and will join and support these efforts.

There are a number of avenues of finance:

**Global Challenge**

The Global Challenge has inspired me to seek funding for the project--which has lain dormant on this issue for many years. A $1 million grant from an organisation such as this would be sufficient to seed the project. So, whether it is via this Challenge, or through some other foundation; whether through crowdsourcing or through angel funding; I believe the money is available.

This $1m will enable the project to purchase and fund for about 3 years a seed community. It will be money-less. It will require anyone wishing to join to give 10% of their total assets or equivalent to the community. The members be provided food, shelter, clothing and tools.

It will require the participation of 20 people. At least 10 will maintain the community, while 10 will work on creating the network.

Once these individuals have been organised into clusters and are familiar with the protocols and functioning of the ToLNet, having pledged support, either financially, or in barter either of some other needed product or item, or time and energy, to the tune of 10%/mth. which should be between $1 - $100. Anyone who wishes to add more would be welcome to. This is because a certain amount of their energy is still being used in earning money for their upkeep.
