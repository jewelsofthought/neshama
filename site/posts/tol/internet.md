## A Word on the Internet

It seems that what this computer revolution has brought us, from all the good, and some of the bad, that has been said about it, is that we are spending more and more of our time in this virtual world. Even our sex is being influenced and shaped by this technology. The religious Jews do not use any of the communication technology beyond regular phones to maintain their purity and not to be tempted or tainted by the influence of these visuals.

Before, our imaginations ran riot in the realms of what was occurring around us. It was shaped by a lot of natural and human influences. But even those human influences were “real”, that is, they existed in the 3d physical reality with which we are surrounded. We might have seen things that influenced us, some good, some bad, but they were real.

Now, how we relate to our sick grandparents is influenced by the plethora of movies we have seen on the internet, or the over-abundance of pictures that have flitted across our mental and visual screen. How to deal with our relationships, and sex, will be influenced by what we have absorbed in this realm.

Be that as it may, the really deviant and dangerous aspect of this, is that this realm is completely controlled by a relatively small group of people. It is a way of deep mind control. The information you can feed a young child in the first 13 years of his or her life, is crucial to his growth and her relationship with herself, and with the society around her. As we know, they are like sponges and will take in whatever influences they encounter, and many will become critical to their formation.

Whereas before this was all happening in the physical realm, now there are always alternatives in the virtual one. Which has also become a mall for all tastes, from the sublime to the ridiculous, from the benign to the dangerous. ISIS, they say, arose because of social media; the Arab spring was influenced by the cell phone. If your parents tell you one thing, and you don’t like it, you can always find an alternative view in the virtual world. And the proponents of that view will become your friends, whereas now your parents have become your opposition.

Now not that the previous situation did not have its downsides. Parents could be cruel to children, and hold them hostage to a situation that was not theirs in the making – from paedophilia, to the inevitable fights and arguments that happen in a relationship, as well as other difficulties. In that context, still connected to the greater family or tribe, one could often find a family member that understood your inner flame, and one with whom you often bonded, sometimes more closely than with  immediate family.

As with everything, there is a good side and a bad side. One can find alternatives that one did not realise existed – why most dictatorial countries will restrict internet usage. But one can also find women being violated, and called whores, and bitches and humiliated – as if that is what women liked.

So what can I say in conclusion? That at least pornography, especially violent, needs to be restricted. If you want to visit a strip club, sleep with a prostitute, or get involved in BDSM practice, then do it. But be firstly of an appropriate age, and willing to actually physically get yourself there – as opposed to sitting in your room and cruising.

But the real danger that is occurring is that more and more of our time and imagination is being harnessed by the virtual world. It is taking over our minds and worse, our imagination. And it is controlled by a small cadre of powerful people. So beware, the NWO is on its way to shaping your mind for their purposes.

The only saving grace we have at this stage, is their lack of imagination. With the rampant greed and need for constant increase of profit, the game is still not very sophisticated. But when someone or some group arises and realizes the true potential here, that it will be possible to shape peoples minds from a young age – then we will find ourselves in deeper trouble. When our beliefs and our behaviour is to be moulded by this virtual reality that has been programmed, then we will be living in a very different world from the one we are in now.

Perhaps that is the coming of the new paradigm. Perhaps that is the New World that we dream of. Are these ascended beings that we are to become, our avatars in the virtual reality? Is this way to an homogenous functioning society that accepts its oneness, as well as its diversity.

We teeter on the edge of this. It is inevitable. It is happening. We are being more and more influenced by this reality every day. Even the rural poor and homeless reach for it through their TV’s and cell phones. Soon everyone will be on the grid – except for those religious, those Luddites, and those who are committed against living this way.

So, I pray that those that form the Matrix, are benign and will be spiritually advanced enough to create a grid that is to the benefit of all, and not just to a small elite. I ask that they will be open enough to program in [to the matrix] acceptance of diversity and creativity, and allow those that do not want to be in the grid, space and place to be.

Bless Us All,
