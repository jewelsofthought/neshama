## Full of light

        "The heaven that is full of light is a human heaven. It would be as if the visible spectrum became everything... then it would not be part of anything.
        -- Winkler: The Magic of the Ordinary

## Light

The Light can only come from darkness. Think of this in terms of the EMF spectrum, most of which is "invisible" to the human eye&mdash;though perhaps not to his conscious mind (sub or not). ![EMF spectrum](/site/posts/img/tol/fn-spectrum.svg).

Anything beyond the visible spectrum is "dark", though we have designed tools to enable to "see" that which is dark. Beyond the "visible" darkness, we have discovered a deeper (or further) darkness&mdash;that which exists beyond the horizon, beyond the edges of the detected spectrum.

## Messiah

Is one man going to come down from heaven and "save" us? And from whom do we need saving? From ourselves? How can anyone save you from yourself? If G-d has granted us free choice, then only you can change yourself. G-d and the angels can only help you. [Shabbat angels - Two angels on shabbat. May it be even better next Shabbas] But you, I, have to take the first step. Have to say: "This is who I am. And this is what I am going to do..." and the rest will follow - if it is in accordance with God's wish...

## Visionary

- Revelatory narrative
  - narrative of one man
  - promises benefits
  - claims "hidden" knowledge
    - the ability to maintain a conspiracy is inversly proportional to the amount of people involved.

## Creating the false narrative

That is the way the story of our life unfolds. We formulate a narrative, a story that defines who we are and what we will be & do. This narrative will succeed according to how fully we believe it. As well as to how accurate the narrative is&mdash;both in describing what actually took place, and in terms that accurately express the world/environment in which the events unfolded.

The way to control the masses is to create a Grand Narrative (or rather, the Great Lie)

Here are some examples of these Grand (False) Narratives:

- The King/Emperor/Pharaoh is Divine (descended from the Gods)
- The virgin birth of Christ
- Receiving the Torah from God.
- The existence of a "soul-mate".
  A love that completes you, that fills the holes that you cannot fill

Just remember **love does not change someone's basic nature**. If they are selfish, or kind... Being loved changes everyone. Being unloved does too!

## Archetypical forces

Some of these are archetypical&mdash;in that they represent the forces that influence our world. But, those that wish for power, will "materialise" these, and make "statues" or edicts" to represent and uphold the narrative.... THAT THEY CONTROL.

The only true sovereignty that one can have under this is to create one's own narrative. The weakness in that is that you are then alone, and can easily be eliminated. Thus you have to find others who believe in a similar narrative (or have come to believe in ...) and thus the cycle begins again.

For, everything has its upper and its lower. You could say it follows the will to rise, or the will to descend. The only other option is for it to remain static, and not change, but be changed by the changes that occur around it.

However, thank God, today we have more sophisticated language and tools with which to express the finer points. Because, the previous, very well-known representation, is rather brutish&mdash;in that we know today that there are many, in fact an infinite amount of, gradations between the "upper" and the "lower". But that is also because we are able to perceive and deal with a three-dimensional world much easier and better than most of our predecessors. (This is my hope. Not just that there are more of us because of the increase in population, but that the actual percentage has increased...)

But, we know that besides an up and a down, there is a left and a right. In fact, there is also a "depth". Graphically, we could also represent the situation of a single point becoming sovereign. It has "nothing to stand on", literally. However, if it "spreads" - i.e. gains "breadth", that point rises, supported by a broad base, ala pyramidical, thus is stable and can maintain its integrity.
