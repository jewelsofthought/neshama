## Priesthood

We are the priesthood of the new age. It is not necessary to awaken the sleepers, for their tasks might be different. It is only necessary for the blessed ones to arise and reclaim their rightful places in the earthly paradise in which we live. We will bring heaven and earth together. We have to dedicate ourselves, each and every one of us, to this task and no longer expend energy in trying to change the followers into leaders, nor sheep into wolves. But only recognise our bond together, and acknowledge one another for who and what we are, harnessing our energies in the forging the path, creating the bridge to the new world.

Amen.

## World governance

In order to have a world government we would need a global community that participates and supports such a system. The way in which we all, the people, interface with such a system is governance is of ultimate importance. This is what the concept of the Tree of Life Network brings to us. It is a vision of a manner to weave a more dynamic, better connected and more responsive global community that will form the foundation of this World Government.

This Tree of Life Network is envisaged as a platform upon which we can begin to weave the interdependencies and systems that will best support the local needs of people.

## Governance in the global space.

The challenge is to bring governance into the global space.

Humanity is rediscovering its commons: the self-organized management of resources which people need for their survival and livelihood. The ethic of commoning is based on the recognition that a person has the right to a means of sustenance without interference or harm from others. In this sense, the commons are an inclusive expression of the right to life and the right to justice.

Our greatest challenge is not the risk of environmental collapse, resource wars, scarcity diaspora's, oppressive rulers or rancorous disputes over why future generations are denied the opportunity to live in a peaceful and equitable society. Our true task is the creation of inclusionary institutions for sustainable resource production and provisioning as the various crises bear down upon the world.

## Errors

The robustness of the system is tested not when everything goes right, but by how well it overcomes challenges—the efficiency of the error-correcting algorithm. The efficacy of all communication systems is in how well they handle the incorrect communications that are inevitably going to occur.

## Victory

> The only way to fight an organised enemy is with stealth - organised as a loosely coupled web of tight units.

## New Age Movement

The so-called “New Age” movement is, at its essence negative. It spends most of its time and energy criticizing the present paradigm, instead of focusing on envisioning and creating a new one.

## Labour

We have made a commodity of labour, separating a person’s labour from the person. Thus we can then quantify the labour, referring to the people as the “labour force” and use it, separate from the “life force” of the person. In this way we can justify using a person’s labour and not compensating them sufficiently to sustain a decent living.

This is also why a legal system that is essentially inhuman(e) arises. It treats the human as a commodity that can be legislated, ignoring his/her essential humanity. How can we be granted rights that encompass what it is to be human?

It is the same way we have been treating animals - as units of production.

## Tools need Tools

It seems to be a contradiction that we wish to use the very tools to create a life that decries these very tools.

The activities of this world are still driven by the enfranchised of the world as opposed to the disenfranchised, creating an ever-widening gap. With a legal system now enshrining our inability to bridge it. Carried along with our knowledge of the truth of the need to close this gap, which requires acknowledging the equivalent humanness of each and every one, we are frozen with the fear of making the jump, holding onto all our "things", feeding the patterns we know, all the time, fearing their demise.

We live on the razor edge of this contradiction. How come we are so blessed, surrounded by all this wealth? Are those we deem poor, poor in spirit too?

The answer to this is a resounding no. For the experience of poverty is not a lesser spiritual experience than that of wealth. It depends on the person’s relationship to his wealth or poverty that will determine their essential spiritual experience.

In fact, we could generalise that to say that our spiritual experience is defined and determined by our relationship to the material things and aspects of our life.

This might seem like a contradiction, in that we generally judge a person's spirituality by their relationship to the non-material, the Divine nature of things. However, it is extremely difficult to judge the truth of that. As we have been born into this material world, and our work is here to express the Divine in the material, it is thus through our relationship to the "real", the material, aspects of the world that it is possible to judge how materialisticly or spiritually biased a person is.

Is his or her focus on the materialistic aspects of his life? Or are the spiritual aspects apparent in her relationship to the real aspects of her life?

## Technology & Solutions

We seek technological solutions that are sound to solve the problems that face us and that have been created essentially by the very technology that we wish to amend. It becomes a vote for or against a certain technology, not about the technology itself.

Are we so embedded in this way of life that we can envisage no other? Perhaps it is a question of the mental versus the intuitive. Where the mental is the ability to evaluate and comprehend within a certain set of criterion, whereas the intuitive is placing our faith in the universe and believing in ourselves and our ability to solve the crises before us in a manner that is sustainable.

Perhaps this is the masculine principle versus the feminine. The outer versus the inner. Julia Butterfly exemplified this. She says that she just wished to express the truth – and that truth is her inner truth, as do all of us, the enlightened ones.

It may be interesting if we began to think of ourselves this way. Is it not the truth that there are many who do not, nor do they want to study and deal with the holy places of the Spirit and the planet.

## Specialisation

Specialisation produces a web of Inter-dependencies

## Systems

All dynamic/moving systems are alive. If a system never changes, then it is dead. If a food can stand open for a long time, then it is dead. All static, absolute, unmoving systems are dead. Thus sterilized systems or pasteurised food stuffs are often life depleting. Though there is support and nourishment that a dead tree or animal provides the living creature of the forest.

## Sovereignty ~ empowerment

There is no real sovereignty. The only real sovereign is G-d. The only earthly sovereignty we experience, is as power over. What we can seek only in the societal environment, is "empowerment".

## Law

Because there is no law forbidding something, does not mean it is acceptable to do it.

## Bridging

If an addict wishes to change and escape the chains of his addiction, he needs a safe alternative, before he crashes. If there is a bridge available that provided a way out of his present situation, and into something safe, many would choose that option - especially in the current global crisis.

### Between two worlds

Just as the healer tries to guide the addict out of his darkness into another world, a world that is filled with more light for him especially. Similarly, the mystic tries to lead people, who are unhappy and unfulfilled, to a path that will increase their joy and light.

## 666m (cov-19)

But the descent from 7B to 666m will be catastrophic and will be a stranger to any who dreamt of a world with only 666m people inhabiting it.

## Fish

Like a school of fish, all travelling in the same direction. But what position any particular fish takes, or when or why is unclear.

- Highly complex and time consuming to reconstruct.
- Use "wave dynamics to cause it to flow over like a wave
  - Amplitude, speed, frequencey, phase angle...
- How many variables?
  - Indexer does not have to calculate.
  - It just keeps the waves flowing
- Source
  - When the wave leaves its source, each element reacts according to its state.
  - The next one will know it and reject and begin reset.
  - Traverses as far as it needs
    or exits with error.

I have been trying to build the tree from the top down, starting at the root and spreading out from there. The actual way that it needs to be expressed is each individual as a seed, that grows into a tree, that becomes a forest... connecting to all the other "forests" out there.

The health of any forest is determined both by the health of its trees, that is the health of its members, and the environment in which they grow. As well as the environment around the forest, with the climate, the rain, and the other factors that sustain a healthy forest.

It is said that in healthy forest ecosystems, they will communicate events between one another... and the receiver will begin to react to this information.

In human terms, the individual is the seed, he (hopefully) grows into a healthy adult, who becomes a productive member of his community, which (hopefully) co-exists in a symbiotic manner with the communities around.

## Great Pirates

Bucky F. talked about the Great Pirates of yore. I think these pirates have reached a new level. It has become simply a protection racket. When in a land of gangsterism, the only choice a normal person has is to choose - is which gang to become part of.

Gangs seem to be the natural form of authority that arises when there is no other.

However, there is a newer, more conscious version of this that is arising, albeit rough and still in its infancy. We refer to it as social networks - also referred to as networks of affinity. Where people of like minds share and collaborate.

That is, if he is lucky enough to have a choice, which is actually why we refer to them as gangs - as they generally do not give one a choice - and use whatever means necessary, even killing, to achieve their goals. So what choice do you really have?

And why are many aspects of the legal version of this any different? Especially for those of us who have had the experience of an army - whether as a soldier or a civilian.

## Information scarcity

What I have noticed in the last years, is that the information freely available is becoming scarcer. This was not done by privatising the internet, by rather by privatising the information available on the public net. Once again, producing control of the information by the elite. But it did not end there. Then began the campaign to discredit the public source of information. This was done by polluting the information that was flowing along the public channel.

An unintended effect of this, or perhaps it is an intended one, is that idiotic news appeals to idiots, and this generally starts a popular movement - any meme to express the outrage and frustration endemic amongst the oppressed underclass. Remember, the underclass does not necessarily have to oppressed. In fact, they are often the unsung heroes of many a triumph, with their quiet solitude and desire to just have a peaceful and happy life - not striving as those who already have too much seem to be constantly doing.

## Multi-dimensional being

Think of yourself as a multi-dimensional being. If that is too difficult, as the question might arise, what is a dimension actually - and the answer, as you can imagine, is not simple, then think of it as being pulled by numerous "attractors", like a cart, that is pulled by lots of horses. Think of a habit as one of those pulls. An addiction is an unstoppable (omnipotent), or omni-present pull. Omnipotent - as in you being powerless in its grip.

When you change a habit or free yourself from an addiction, you have changed your "shape" in the world, and the attractions that were guiding/directing/pulling you, have changed. In other words, the very shape of your being has changed.

And if one part of the whole shape changes, then the shape itself (generally) will change. Thus your change will affect all those around you.

## Personal

Why show me the path, and then I die with never having revealed it? It is the way forward, it is the only reasonable future to hope for. For, if not that one, then what alternatives are there? A totalitarian regime, with absolute control over the whole of humanity? Or a bloody, chaotic descent into barely surviving pockets of humanity (if we survive the apocalypse)

---

## Action -> effect

Any action, just by living, we affect the environment. With this mass of people, anything we do at scale will significantly affect the environment - generally detrimentally.

By nourishing ourselves&mdash;our own needs&mdash;, and using that energy - living energy - we deplete resources. We need energy to live. We require energy for movement. In order to obtain that energy, we deplete resources.
Energy only appears when there is a differential - which means one gets nourished, while the other becomes depleted.

## Quadrant

Depending in which quadrant you stand, one pair will be supportive, the other detrimental to the one in the quadrant.

The quadrant consists of "more/less", "increase/decrease".

Only at close to the maximum of "more", is decrease a positive. Any other place, an increase is good... unless what is being increased is not good!
Then increase is a negative.
