- If something is possible for someone, it is possible for anyone.

- Accept the things to which fate binds you

- There is nothing that hinders you from doing what must be done.

## R' Y"mba quotes

### Every Idea

> "Every bad idea has many good reasons".

### Insurance

> Insurance is an interesting vehicle for paying forward for a service that you might never receive.

### Words

> Words that do not elucidate or clarify are wasted words.

### Errors

The robustness of the system is tested not when everything goes right, but by how well it overcomes challenges &mdash; the efficiency of the error-correcting algorithm. The efficacy of all communication systems is in how well they handle the incorrect communications that are inevitably going to occur.

### Victory

The only way to fight an organised enemy is with stealth &ndash; organised as a loosely coupled web of tight units.

### New Age Movement

The so-called "New Age" movement is, at its essence negative. It spends most of its time and energy criticizing the present paradigm, instead of focusing on envisioning and creating a new one.

## Specialisation

Specialisation produces a web of inter-dependencies

## Systems

All dynamic/moving systems are alive. If a system never changes, then it is dead. If a food can stand open for a long time without spoiling then it was already dead. All static, absolute, unmoving systems are dead. Thus sterilized systems or pasteurised food stuffs are often life depleting.

## Sovereignty ~ empowerment

There is no real sovereignty. The only real sovereign is G-d. The only earthly sovereignty we experience, is as power over. What we can seek only in the societal environment, is "empowerment".

## Law

Because there is no law forbidding something, does not mean it is acceptable to do it.

## Bridging

If an addict wishes to change and escape the chains of his addiction, he needs a safe alternative, before he crashes. If there is a bridge available that provides a way out of his predicament, and into something safe, many would choose that option &mdash; especially in the current global crisis.

## Provide

Anything that "they" provide us, they can take away/remove. "They", the unknown ones, that hide in the shadows, wielding the sword of Damocles. Everything "they" provide comes at a price/cost to us, from which they benefit (and it seems, most often, financially).

## Ground state

This information is gathered for the living entity which has to maintain a certain stasis/ground state or stable state, which would make it's form recognisable/perceivable.

## Non-human consciousness (NHC)

NHC is apparent in all species, in fact, in the world around us. However, we have a form of NHC which we have created (also could be thought of as the narrative that we overlay over reality to calm our fears).

We are so eager to embrace NHC, but have yet to acknowledge the trove we are surrounded by.

## Bio-engineering

Because of our new found abilities to reform living organisms, if we do not have a strict moral code regulating this, we will produce abominations! It could result in a whole new species, one never before considered, like the Brains&mdash;who embrace the space with a certain vibrational energy and thus form it = <b>בינה</b>.

## Economics

Whoever controls the resources controls the people. Thus the government will need to "set fiscal policy". Because of separation of the state and religion, it will have no moral, ethical nor spiritual basis. So in the end it will be ego driven, with a purely material goal, covered in a cloak of pseudo-idealism.

## Virtual world

We need to implement the same basic protocols of behaviour in our interactions in the virtual world. In fact, we might need some help with compiling them, as there might be some that we might not discover, until it is too late.

## Shamanic Power (tol?qkab/Shamanism)

We accumulate Shamanic Power by maintaining integrity.  Simply put, every time we make a decision that is different from the one that our spirit would have made, we splinter off a part of ourselves into a parallel reality.  The more splinters we have, the less focus and concentration, the less power to manifest directly.  The process of healing is the process of reclaiming the splinters.  There's a movie about this, "The One", about someone who reclaims his splinters through violence.  It's a ridiculous Hollywoodization of the process, but it demonstrates the game.  Brian Weiss's books do as well.

## Power (ToL)

They see how powerful someone or some nation is and they aspire to obtain some of this power. This is the dynamic of those that desire power. So they will cater to those that have the power. So eventually one has a concentration of power (and money) in the hands of an elite and a larger and larger segment of the population being disempowered. Now because this elite has a large share of the power, they can influence such things as the information flow, and thus public opinion and actions.

## Constraint (ToL)

All aberrant behaviour occurs due to "unnatural" or excessive or unnecessary constraint – which is the exclusive abode of human existence.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;

## Priesthood

We are the priesthood of the new age. It is not necessary to awaken the sleepers, for their tasks might be different. It is only necessary for the blessed ones to arise and reclaim their rightful places in the earthly paradise in which we live. We will bring heaven and earth together. We have to dedicate ourselves, each and every one of us, to this task and no longer expend energy in trying to change the followers into leaders, nor the sheep into wolves. But only recognise our bond together, and acknowledge one another for who and what we are, harnessing our energies in forging the path and creating the bridge to the new world.

Amen.

## Governance in the global space

Humanity is rediscovering its commons: the self-organized management of resources which people need for their survival and livelihood. The ethic of the commons is based on the recognition that a person has the right to a means of sustenance without interference or harm from others. In this sense, the commons are an inclusive expression of the right to life and the right to justice.

Our greatest challenge is not the risk of environmental collapse, resource wars, scarcity diasporas, oppressive rulers or rancorous disputes over why future generations are denied the opportunity to live in a peaceful and equitable society. Our true task is the creation of inclusionary institutions for sustainable resource production and provisioning as the various crises bear down upon the world.

In order to have a world government we would need a global community that participates and supports such a system. The way in which we all, the people, interface with such a system is governance is of ultimate importance. The challenge being to bring governance into the global space without alienating and leaving out most of the people.

This is what the concept of the Tree of Life Network brings to us. It is a vision of a manner to weave a more dynamic, better connected and more responsive global community that will form the foundation of this World Government.

This Tree of Life Network is envisaged as a platform upon which we can begin to weave the interdependencies and systems that will best support the local needs of people.

## Labour

We have made a commodity of labour, separating a person's labour from the person. Thus we can then quantify the labour, referring to the people as the "labour force" and use it, separate from the "life force" of the person. In this way we can justify using a person's labour and not compensating them sufficiently to sustain their lives, having separated their labour from their lives &mdash; from who, or what, they are.

In the same way we have commodified play and leisure.

This is also why a legal system that is essentially inhuman(e) arises. It treats the human as a commodity that can be legislated, ignoring his/her essential humanity, ignoring his/her basic needs. How can we be granted rights that encompass what it is to be human?

We have been treating animals the same way - as units of production.

## Tools need Tools

The activities of this world are still driven by the enfranchised of the world as opposed to the disenfranchised, creating an ever-widening gap. With a legal system now enshrining our inability to bridge it. Carried along with our knowledge of the truth of the need to close this gap, which requires acknowledging the equivalent humanness of each and every one, we are frozen with the fear of making the jump, holding onto all our "things", feeding the patterns we know, all the time, fearing their demise.

We live on the razor edge of this contradiction. How come we are so blessed, surrounded by all this wealth? Are those we deem poor, poor in spirit too? Is not this very structure based on the belief that the experience of poverty is a lesser spiritual experience than that of wealth? But that is not true, say our sages. For it depends on that person's relationship to his wealth or poverty that will determine his essential spiritual experience.

We could generalise this to say that our spiritual experience is defined and determined by our relationship to the material things of our life.

This might seem like a contradiction, in that we generally judge a person's spirituality by their relationship to the non-material, the Divine nature of things. However, it is extremely difficult to judge the truth of that. As we have been born into this material world, and our work is here to express the Divine in the material. It is thus through our relationship to the "real", the material, aspects of the world that it is possible to judge how materialistically or spiritually biased a person is.

## Technology & Solutions

We seek technological solutions to problems that have been created essentially by the very technology that we wish to use to solve them. It is similar to appealing to the very rulers who have implemented certain inhumane rules to rescind these rules.

It becomes a vote for or against a certain technology, not about the technology itself.

Are we so embedded in this way of life that we can envisage no other? Perhaps it is a question of the mental versus the intuitive. Whereas the mental is the ability to evaluate and comprehend within a certain set of criterion, the intuitive is placing our faith in the possibilities inherent in an infinite universe and believing that we might have a part to play in this infinite universe, and believing in ourselves and our ability to solve the crises before us in a manner that is beneficial to the human race as a whole. The mental requires a reduction and separation into its component pieces, whereas the intuitive requires seeing the part as an essential piece of the whole. The whole being the part that is difficult to comprehend.

## Fish

Like a school of fish, all travelling in the same direction. But what position any particular fish takes, or when or why is unclear.

- Highly complex and time consuming to reconstruct.
- Use "wave dynamics to cause it to flow over like a wave
  - Amplitude, speed, frequency, phase angle...
- How many variables?
  - Indexer does not have to calculate.
  - It just keeps the waves flowing
- Source
  - When the wave leaves its source, each element reacts according to its state.
  - The next one will know it and reject and begin reset.
  - Traverses as far as it needs or exits with error.

I have been trying to build the tree from the top down, starting at the root and spreading out from there. The actual way that it needs to be expressed is each individual as a seed, that grows into a tree, that becomes a forest... connecting to all the other "forests" out there.

The health of any forest is determined both by the health of its trees. In healthy forest ecosystems trees will communicate events between one another... and the receiver will react to this information.

In human terms, the individual is the seed that grows into a healthy adult, becoming a productive member of his community which co-exists in a symbiotic manner with the communities around.

## Information scarcity

What I have noticed in the last years, is that the information freely available is becoming scarcer. This was not done by privatising the internet itself but rather by privatising the information available on the public net. Once again we have the situation of control of the information by the elite. But it did not end there. Then began the campaign to discredit public sources of information. This was done by polluting the information that was flowing along the public channel.

An effect of this&mdash;perhaps an intended one&mdash;is that idiotic news appeals to idiots, and this generally starts a popular movement - any meme to express the outrage and frustration endemic amongst the oppressed class(es). Remember, the underclass does not necessarily have to oppressed. In fact, we are often the unsung heroes of many a triumph, with our quiet solitude and desire to just have a peaceful and happy life - not striving as those who already have too much seem to be constantly doing.

## Multi-dimensional being

Think of yourself as a multi-dimensional being. If that is too difficult for the question might arise as to what is a dimension actually - and the answer, as you can imagine, is not simple - then think of it as being pulled by numerous "attractors", like a cart that is pulled by lots of horses. Think of a habit as one of those pulls. An addiction is an unstoppable (omnipotent), or omni-present pull. Omnipotent - as in you being powerless in its grip.

When you change a habit or free yourself from an addiction, you have changed your "shape" in the world, and the attractions that were guiding/directing/pulling you, have changed. In other words, the very shape of your being has changed.

And if one part of the whole shape changes, then the whole shape itself will change. Thus your change will affect all those around you.

## Action -> effect

Any action, even just by living, affects the environment. With this mass of people, anything we do at scale will significantly affect the environment - generally detrimentally.

To nourish ourselves and our own needs, we need energy - living energy. We need energy to live. We require energy for movement. In order to obtain that energy, we deplete resources.

Energy only appears when there is a differential - which means one gets nourished, while the other becomes depleted.

## Human Interface

How human is the interface between the human and the AI/MI? This is not an AI problem, it is a human system interface (HIS - Human Interface to the System) problem.

Two levels:

1. Human level (anthropomorphic, narcissistic)
2. System level (objectification $$\Leftrightarrow$$ virtualisation)

Interface:

- where "consciousness", as a separate identity encounters the "non-conscious"

Empirical non-consciousness. It tracks dead (literally non-conscious) events. Based on data, i.e. measurement, recording, etc. which is non-human.

## Complex systems

A characteristic of complex systems is that they are self-organising. Which means that each element, including the element that contains all (or part) of these elements, "self" regulates, or regulates itself.

<p class="note">
{NOTE: This is a typical objectification, a separation. The same separation we often make between us & G-d - as something that exists outside of myself - which makes me "self" sovereign {sovereign to myself, and no one else}. We then have the option to reject or accept that outside element. Instead, we could accept that we are entangled, so much so, that it is difficult to tell the two &mdash; what is truly me & what is G-d &mdash; apart.}
</p>
The most important things to keep in mind are:

1. A perception of something is not the thing itself, but an "imaginary" or "made-up" version of the actual "thing".
2. There is not someone or something out there having an experience separate from your experience.. Although you could imagine such a thing, the only "experience" you can have of it, is your own "lived" - and therefore limited - experience of it.

## Nature

The closer to nature our lives are, not in that we all have to be pioneers, but that we are not living in contradiction or against the "laws of nature", the healthier and more effective our lives will be. Science tries to describe the natural processes, and then to emulate them&mdash;which is a form of control and of overcoming. Perhaps science should focus on working with the laws that it describes, rather than going against them.

It could bring us into a biblical frame of reference as going against the "Will of G-d". For if G-d is creator of this world, then it is through and by the processes that He has created that He Speaks to us. Thus it is the best to try and listen and hear what She has to say, and operate accordingly.

## Interactions

I see people interacting with one another in new way. The only gateway into that is to have shared revelatory/transcendent experiences. Then the work begins.

Similar to falling into a love relationship. It is a transcendent experience, but the real work is always in 3d. Dealing with the density and darkness of the 3d reality of the other, that is where we can manifest our connection.

## Bureaucratic institutions (ToL)

ToL: 2001 8:10 AM

It seems that in large bureaucratic institutions there is no culpability. Or rather, it seems a fact of life that there when the amount of people participating in an organized structure reaches a specific threshold, the actions of the structure become somewhat removed from the reality or consequences of their actions.

In order to effect change, one has to find those responsible for the issue in question. How does one even go about that? Once one has found this person or people, if you raise the issue, you will always get a lot of justifications as to why it is that way. For there is always a way for us to justify almost any action depending on the circumstances. The proof of that is in the history of all that has happened already.

## Losing it (ToL)

We're really losing it. The symbol of a raised hand, nails manicured to perfection. White, soft holding a small, almost heart-shaped device, with a small space at the bottom, and a flattened top. It has a small, square screen in the middle. It is "the no-fuss mobile Info" device. When you are in the city, you can get a list of restaurants, directions, and events around the city… what happened to spontaneity? We will not have to talk to people to get directions anymore. Will the experience be enhanced, as technology always claims?

It is as if we have become fascinated with our own magic. And it is magical, the life we live. Talking to one another over long distances. Watching pictorial and aural representations projected over huge areas and distances, making a kind of ritual out of it. For we can all experience the same moments through the commonality of TV. It is similar to the Passover ritual for the Jews, where there are millions of people all over the world, who will be celebrating the same event, in very similar ways, reading the same story, eating similar food. Investigating the outer and inner reaches of the universe we are aware of, with tools and mechanisms, which only the high priests of science can understand.

The rest of us, are just recipients of their vision. And live like rats in a cage that the Lords of Society have fashioned for us to be experimented upon. Our consciousness has been turned upon ourselves, and we are not aware of the society we are fashioning. For it is no longer a singular absolute decision that we can make, but one that will affect every part of the system. This is what our high priests are reporting back to us.

The same burning desire to understand the world around us. The same willingness to sacrifice everything, even themselves to understand it. In the same fashion, did the witchdoctors and priests of yore explore. And so did the rest of us listen, as we are listening now. Always with the distraction of the one's hungry for power. The Dark Lords that tempt us, and project and reflect our own darkness, our own hunger to fulfil our every desire, even the darkest. The ones who live the life we fantasize about, so we produce the blessed ones of our desire to be recognized. Here, it is even more important to separate the _Yetzer Ha'Rah_ from the _Yetzer Ha'Tov_, the good from the evil. There is a huge difference is there not between a famous movie star and an infamous psychopath, whether a sanctioned or unsanctioned killer – though both are expressions of our dark side.

## Labour (ToL)

We have made a commodity of labour, separating the person's labour from the person. Thus we can quantify the labour, refer to it as a labour "force", and use it, separately from the life of the person.

This is in order to quantize a person's labour, and thus put him in a profit making context, instead of a human one.

In the same way we have commodified play and leisure.

## Negative agenda (ToL)

The problem is that the movement is at its essence negative. It spends its time criticizing the present paradigm, instead of help building and leading it to a new, positive expression of the old one.

The problem with the aristocracy is that it is not expressing the truth of their desires. When you are rich and have the power and there is a whole slew of society that is in poverty, would you not want to be able to own such a toy?

## Co-create (ToL)

It is about being taught that we can create our own world, our own environment. That is the freedom we all seek. The tribal directive tells us that we should all live the world within a certain framework, and that it is impossible to live without that framework, and be happy, or fulfilled or go to heaven, otherwise.

So, starting off as kids, where we are taught to accept the edicts handed down to us from above, whether it is by our parents, our teachers, or by any other adults. So we are born with others who have authority over us, and then we grow up to have the ultimate authority, in the name of God and his minions, describing the framework within which we are allowed to work.

Thus the ultimate cage. That of the one that is defined by God, and then handed down to us by Man. We often forget that this is just a Human interpretation of the Will of the God, the Unknowable. It is fortified by the mythos that surrounds the enlightened one's, Allah, Buddha, Mohammed, to name a few. For they, being human like us, are also supposed to be Divine.

Now, there are two attitudes that emerge from this.

The first is that they are better, or different, than us. They are "special". That is an attitude that fortifies the division between us. That there are those who are "special" and different, and thus deserve their differing status is life –the aristocracy, the wealthy, or even the prophets.

Then there is the more enlightened view, which states that if they are indeed human, then they are much the same as any of us. Thus, any and all of us, have the potential to become enlightened like any of them, and thus by the same token we carry the divine seed in each of us too.

Now, going back to the framework, it is an incredible testament to the creativity that we can achieve and accomplish so much within this limited structure. For, as we know, this structure, handed down to us in another human – and thus limited - interpretation. As we know, if the underlying framework is Divine, that is, part of the infinite One that is all we know and more, then the framework is essentially infinite in all directions, therefore anything's possible.

## Global leadership (ToL)

Harvard Business Review, Dec 2005. Regional Strategies for Global Leadership by Pankaj Ghemawat.

"It is often a mistake to set out to create a worldwide strategy. Better results come from strong regional strategies, brought together into a global whole."

This is another concept of ToLNet.

I have not yet read the article, but the graph labelled "Intraregional Trade as a Percentage of Total Trade" on p101 from "United Nations: International Trade Statistics Yearbooks, 1958 to 2000." was fascinating. Between 1958 and 2000, rising from 55% to about 65% for Europe, from 40% up to 60% for Americas, from about 37% to 48% for Asia, dropping from 60% to 20% for Eastern Europe and former USSR, with the Middle East and Africa hovering around 10%.

This says that Africa and the Middle East have inefficient regional economies. And the most effective way to empower the populace would be to strengthen these local economies. This graph shows that most of the wealth of the nation is being removed and not generating must wealth for the local economies. In the fashion of the TOL, the population needs to focus on their local needs and themselves to create the infrastructure to support this. If most of the money stays in the local economy, it will give it a strong base. If it is bringing in more money than is flowing out of it, then it will become a wealthy economy.

This is what shows as Americas's pain. It is a disjoint, a disconnected culture. It abhors failure and thus requires "every man for himself". A selfish narcissistic endeavour.

This makes me think that perhaps this is the way I see the universe. It is how I look at myself and my life.

## Magic & Science (ToL)

Mystic, Mysticism and Magic – Joscelyn Godwin p148 – Johannes Kepler

"Laws of the solar system as derived from the five regular solids… was the result of divine law, interpreted not just as a geometrical but also as a mystical harmony.."

brought me to the following:

1. All laws, even those that are "scientific" are expressions of divine law. For instance, the laws of gravity, are Divine laws.
2. To look at one's life in that manner, seeing that one is contained in surroundings filled with G-d's laws. And that every action is a dialogue (a negotiation) with these Divine laws.
3. That is how science co-opted religion so completely. Because these were mystics who penetrated the secrets of the universe, under the banner of science, and not under the banner of being mystics. They never for a moment thought that they were not penetrating the mind of G-d, which was, to their minds, a holy quest. So the "laws" that they "discovered" were accepted scientifically, and not mystically. Though, by the masses, they realised that they were actually mystical.

## No humans (ToL)

What difference would it make if there were no humans alive, except to other humans? None!

All other species (of those remaining) seem to have an intrinsic and essential part to play in the unfolding web of life. What is ours? It seems that we are no essential to any part of the Web of Life. Is this why we are drawn by this insatiable desire to affect everything around us? Even our very human-ness? Is this a cry for love, so that the unfeeling, uncaring universe will notice us.

By the fact that we are no essential to material life, makes me think that possibly we need to affect some other part or aspect of existence - like the "spiritual", the "ephemeral" part perhaps.

Are we like children misbehaving so that our absent father will wake up and notice us? Is He so busy with His other affairs that He has no time or desire to pay any attention to us? Does He not care about us?

I believe that He is paying incredible attention towards us, and is pouring His energy and love into us constantly.

## Born (ToL)

I did not ask to be born as I am, in what I live. In fact, I have great difficulty with a lot of it. Perhaps the best anyone could hope to do, is make it better?

My whole being, my very soul cries out "No! It cannot be!" I will not accept a fate, a universe so cruel and perverse as this is purported to be - though I myself have experienced mostly great things, much kindness and love, and a life full of abundance. I refuse to bow to the concept of a Sovereign Being filled with such human frailties and pettiness. G-d is not creating a drama for His entertainments. We are not pets performing some macabre dance. These are all nightmares dreamt up in minds sunk into darkness and despair at the absence of purpose or meaning.

Yet that is the reality we are facing. It is a Truth that many struggle with, and not a few succumb to. We know, my brethren, that it is in times of darkness that our faith is truly tested. Measured not by our ability to wage war or take up arms in the name of what is true&mdash;not that that might not be an important part of the reality of what is coming&mdash;but by our ability to stand firm on mother earth. To claim, by our divine right to exist, my "internal" sovereignty.

## Complexity

- The only thing that can contain everything is nothing!

- The more information, the greater the complexity and the greater the energy requirements.

- Due to the level of complexity of the collective, plus its global nature, it has to be more inter-dependent that any past experience of such collectivism.

- A society built on handling crises, not for maintaining the stability of said society, will eventually begin to manufacture crises, even if unconsciously, or due to inherent/actual, imagined, or inherited fears. Once these behaviours have become embedded in the systems (systemic), they can then be consciously manipulated by those who have some perceived gain from said manipulation.

- Who has more to gain than those who hold power and wealth: "Everything to gain, everything to lose" is the refrain of kings and CEO's.

- A billionaire loses a billion, and has to live in his mansion on a measly million or so a year, having to trade or sell his other 5 abodes, perhaps let go of his luxury cars. Joe lost his business, had debts to pay, loses his house. Now has no money, no house, no job and little prospect of ever attaining a decent life. And we say that the billionaire lost everything? Because it is bigger, higher, faster, does not mean it is better!

---

## Slavery

We are evolving.

We are being held in slavery by corrupt, brutal, ruthless rulers. People who attain power for power's sake, supported by fearful, ignorant zealots. These zealots I call one dimensional beings. For they can ony see or believe in one thing (at a time). They also only see what is in front of them, no further.

Prophets might say that they are G-dless and immoral, and unless we mend our ways, we will encounter G-d's wrath!

I say it is a simple by flawed system that expends a huge amount of energy and resources on covering up its flaws with false narratives and copious half-lies, propped by "confidentiality" based on "national security", and the shaping of the narrative by their lackeys in the mainstream media. Remember, it is always the victor of any battle whose narrative is the only narrative allowed. So-called terrorist organisation are bad news, but they are sourced from a pool of people with legitimate issues. Agreed that once a reign of tyrannical rules has been established, and people's choices have been removed - they have to obey and comply with whatever arbitrary and uncaring edicts the rulers issue.

## Hero

Although the average man is constantly regaled with tales of the hero who overcomes the evil empire, or impossible odds &mdash; there is literally no real event of that nature that has occurred because of one man alone. No man ever became emperor because of his merit or because of his power alone. Any cataclysmic social event was always carried out by a ground of dedicated men and women who were, im most cases, willing to die for what they were fighting for, and/or for what they believed in.

It is easy to forget the complexity of our existence, preferring to focus on one face, whether good or evil, with which identify with. between for and against, in simplistic, binary sense - "You're either with me, or you against me.

## AIDS

If we see AIDS as a result of a compromised immune system, it would make sense in the light of the ever increasing exposure to the many toxins present in our environment stressing the body's defence systems. This exposure is ever increasing, the degradation of our food, needing "supplements" to replace the lack of nutritional elements available. In addition, these toxins are present in our air, our water and our homes. We are also being bombarded by EMF's, which will create an extra stress.

We are also very lacking in the arena of knowing what the effect of multiple toxins are on our bodies. There is even the possibility that the EMF's will affect the way in which these chemicals interface with our bodies and our environment. And we continue to increase the exposure to them year by year.

## Magic of Technology

> The extent to which you wish to give to the Creator, will be the extent to which you gain satisfaction with what you do.

We're really losing it. The symbol of a raised hand, nails manicured to perfection. White, soft holding a small, almost heart-shaped device, with a small space at the bottom, and a flattened top. It has a small, square screen in the middle. It is "the no-fuss mobile Info" device. When you are in the city, you can get a list of restaurants, directions, and events around the city… what happened to spontaneity? We will not have to talk to people to get directions anymore. Will the experience be enhanced, as technology always claims?

It is as if we have become fascinated with our own magic. And it is magical, the life we live. Talking to one another over long distances. Watching pictorial and aural representations projected over huge areas and distances, making a kind of ritual out of it. For we can all experience the same moments through the commonality of TV. It is similar to the Passover ritual for the Jews, where there are millions of people all over the world, who will be celebrating the same event, in very similar ways, reading the same story, eating similar food. Investigating the outer and inner reaches of the universe we are aware of, with tools and mechanisms, that only the high priests of science can understand.

The rest of us, are just recipients of their vision. And live like rats in a cage that the Lords of Society have fashioned for us to be experimented upon. Our consciousness has been turned upon ourselves, and we are not aware of the society we are fashioning. For it is no longer a singular absolute decision that we can make, but one that will affect every part of the system. This is what our high priests are reporting back to us.

The same burning desire to understand the world around us. The same willingness to sacrifice everything, even themselves to understand it. In the same fashion, did the witchdoctors and priests of yore explore. And so did the rest of us listen, as we are listening now. Always with the distraction of the one's hungry for power. The Dark Lords that tempt us, and project and reflect our own dark desires, our own hunger to fulfil our every fantasy, even the darkest. The ones who live the life we fantasize about, so we produce the blessed ones of our desire to be recognized. Here, it is even more important to separate the _Yetzer Ha'Rah_ from the _Yetzer Ha'Tov_, the good from the evil. There is a huge difference of the impact between a famous ware hero and an infamous psychopath – the one a sanctioned, the other an unsanctioned killer – both are expressions of our dark side.

## Ghetto

It is not the fact that they are collecting information about us. It is the intention behind the collecting of information, the purpose behind the action. (This is another example of the differential/integral model. The direction is the collection of information. The use of that information is the integral function.)

The reason they want all this information, is not to help you (that is a side effect of the main purpose. If they do help you, then they may get your business, for their service or product becomes a perceived value add.), but to make a profit. Here is where we become the rats in the cage, our only purpose in life, as perceived by the marketeers, is to benefit their company and make them rich and profitable. For that is the ultimate purpose of existence as defined by this culture. The US having brought this motif to the level of an art form, using all the science and technology that they can muster.

This has to change to be used for the benefit of us all. To track and monitor our habits desires and needs. Our purpose in life should be to ensure that we all have the means with which to express these desires and fulfil our needs, hopefully in a positive and constructive manner. Though if our ethic has changed to be one of aiding one another to achieve this, and we are rewarded appropriately, so that it becomes worth our while, and we receive the recognition that all of us yearn for, I think we will begin to see less and less incidents of destructive and non-productive behaviour patterns.

For example, there is a group in New York City of organic farmers that began to give out free fresh fruit and vegetables in the poverty stricken areas of the 5 boroughs. By feeding the people, and eventually providing them with work, the crime rate in the area dropped, to the level that the city noticed, and began to support them financially, and use the police to help them distribute the food. Apparently, now that the people did not have to deal in drugs to feed their family, they stopped doing so. Also, now that the kids saw that there were other ways of earning a living, besides drug dealing, which was the only way of getting ahead in the ghetto, they began to take to it.

## Power

They see how powerful someone or some nation is and they aspire to obtain some of this power. This is the dynamic of those that desire power. So they will cater to those that have the power. So eventually one has a concentration of power (and money) in the hands of an oligarchy with a larger and larger segment of the population being disempowered. Because this elite has a lion share of the power, they can influence such things as the information flow, and thus public opinion and actions.

## Culpability

2001 8:10 AM

It seems that in large bureaucratic institutions there is no culpability. Or rather, it seems a fact of life that there when the amount of people participating in an organized structure reaches a specific threshold, the actions of the structure become somewhat removed from the reality or consequences of their actions.

In order to effect change, one has to find those responsible for the issue in question. How does one even go about that? Once one has found this person or people, if you raise the issue, you will always get a lot of justifications as to why it is that way. For there is always a way for us to justify almost any action depending on the circumstances. The proof of that is in the history of all that has happened already.

## Information gathering

It is not the fact that they are collecting information about us. It is the intention behind the collecting of information, the purpose behind the action. (This is another example of the differential/integral model. The direction is the collection of information. The use of that information is the integral function.)

## Institutions

The masses need to be bound, otherwise they enter into paroxysms of self-destruction.

The institutions of yore were the anchors to which we were bound. They are crumbling, and uncertain in this time, and thus the society as a whole begins to crack.

## Chaos

XO (from brown diary 2010) Feb 07, 2013:

I am afraid we are heading straight for a disaster. It is not going to be a single disaster, but a series of cascading disasters that will climax in a catastrophic system failure. If the system is too centralised, then it has major nodes that if they fail will cause systemic collapse. Thus it is imperative to begin to distribute the generation of power and energy, of manufacturing and production as locally as possible. This is necessary for the survival of the system.

It is essentially a participatory system, in which the participants co-operate to produce the best results for all. We could argue endlessly on the details of what is best, but we can start with what is necessary. Air, water and food are the three fundamentals of individual life. Children is a prerequisite for human life. Shelter is a necessary component for families to survive. Shelter would bring in the concept of safety and sovereignty. Let us start there.
