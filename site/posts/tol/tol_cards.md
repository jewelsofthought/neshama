“Every bad idea has many good reasons”.

## Priesthood

We are the priesthood of the new age. It is not necessary to awaken the sleepers, for their tasks might be different. It is only necessary for the blessed ones to arise and reclaim their rightful places in the earthly paradise in which we live. We will bring heaven and earth together. We have to dedicate ourselves, each and every one of us, to this task and no longer expend energy in trying to change the followers into leaders, nor the sheep into wolves. But only recognise our bond together, and acknowledge one another for who and what we are, harnessing our energies in forging the path and creating the bridge to the new world.

Amen.

## Governance in the global space.

Humanity is rediscovering its commons: the self-organized management of resources which people need for their survival and livelihood. The ethic of commoning is based on the recognition that a person has the right to a means of sustenance without interference or harm from others. In this sense, the commons are an inclusive expression of the right to life and the right to justice.

Our greatest challenge is not the risk of environmental collapse, resource wars, scarcity diasporas, oppressive rulers or rancorous disputes over why future generations are denied the opportunity to live in a peaceful and equitable society. Our true task is the creation of inclusionary institutions for sustainable resource production and provisioning as the various crises bear down upon the world.

In order to have a world government we would need a global community that participates and supports such a system. The way in which we all, the people, interface with such a system is governance is of ultimate importance. The challenge being to bring governance into the global space without alienating and leaving out most of the people.

This is what the concept of the Tree of Life Network brings to us. It is a vision of a manner to weave a more dynamic, better connected and more responsive global community that will form the foundation of this World Government.

This Tree of Life Network is envisaged as a platform upon which we can begin to weave the interdependencies and systems that will best support the local needs of people.

## Errors

The robustness of the system is tested not when everything goes right, but by how well it overcomes challenges &mdash; the efficiency of the error-correcting algorithm. The efficacy of all communication systems is in how well they handle the incorrect communications that are inevitably going to occur.

## Victory

The only way to fight an organised enemy is with stealth &ndash; organised as a loosely coupled web of tight units.

## New Age Movement

The so-called “New Age” movement is, at its essence negative. It spends most of its time and energy criticizing the present paradigm, instead of focusing on envisioning and creating a new one.

## Labour

We have made a commodity of labour, separating a person’s labour from the person. Thus we can then quantify the labour, referring to the people as the “labour force” and use it, separate from the “life force” of the person. In this way we can justify using a person’s labour and not compensating them sufficiently to sustain their lives, having separated their lobour from their lives &mdash; from who, or what, they are.

This is also why a legal system that is essentially inhuman(e) arises. It treats the human as a commodity that can be legislated, ignoring his/her essential humanity, ignoring his/her basic needs. How can we be granted rights that encompass what it is to be human?

We have been treating animals the same way - as units of production.

## Tools need Tools

The activities of this world are still driven by the enfranchised of the world as opposed to the disenfranchised, creating an ever-widening gap. With a legal system now enshrining our inability to bridge it. Carried along with our knowledge of the truth of the need to close this gap, which requires acknowledging the equivalent humanness of each and every one, we are frozen with the fear of making the jump, holding onto all our "things", feeding the patterns we know, all the time, fearing their demise.

We live on the razor edge of this contradiction. How come we are so blessed, surrounded by all this wealth? Are those we deem poor, poor in spirit too? Is not this very structure based on the belief that the experience of poverty is a lesser spiritual experience than that of wealth? But that is not true, say our sages. For it depends on that person’s relationship to his wealth or poverty that will determine his essential spiritual experience.

We could generalise this to say that our spiritual experience is defined and determined by our relationship to the material things of our life.

This might seem like a contradiction, in that we generally judge a person's spirituality by their relationship to the non-material, the Divine nature of things. However, it is extremely difficult to judge the truth of that. As we have been born into this material world, and our work is here to express the Divine in the material. It is thus through our relationship to the "real", the material, aspects of the world that it is possible to judge how materialisticly or spiritually biased a person is.

## Technology & Solutions

We seek technological solutions to problems that have been created essentially by the very technology that we wish to use to solve them. It is similar to appealing to the very rulers who have implemented certain inhumane rules to rescind these rules.

It becomes a vote for or against a certain technology, not about the technology itself.

Are we so embedded in this way of life that we can envisage no other? Perhaps it is a question of the mental versus the intuitive. Whereas the mental is the ability to evaluate and comprehend within a certain set of criterion, the intuitive is placing our faith in the possibilities inherent in an infinite universe and believing that we might have a part to play in this infinite universe, and believing in ourselves and our ability to solve the crises before us in a manner that is beneficial to the human race as a whole. The mental requires a reduction and separation into its component pieces, whereas the intuitive requires seeing the part as an essential piece of the whole. The whole being the part that is difficult to comprehend.

## Specialisation

Specialisation produces a web of inter-dependencies

## Systems

All dynamic/moving systems are alive. If a system never changes, then it is dead. If a food can stand open for a long time without spoiling then it was already dead. All static, absolute, unmoving systems are dead. Thus sterilized systems or pasteurised food stuffs are often life depleting.

## Sovereignty ~ empowerment

There is no real sovereignty. The only real sovereign is G-d. The only earthly sovereignty we experience, is as power over. What we can seek only in the societal environment, is "empowerment".

## Law

Because there is no law forbidding something, does not mean it is acceptable to do it.

## Bridging

If an addict wishes to change and escape the chains of his addiction, he needs a safe alternative, before he crashes. If there is a bridge available that provides a way out of his predicament, and into something safe, many would choose that option &mdash; especially in the current global crisis.

## Fish

Like a school of fish, all travelling in the same direction. But what position any particular fish takes, or when or why is unclear.

- Highly complex and time consuming to reconstruct.
- Use "wave dynamics to cause it to flow over like a wave
  - Amplitude, speed, frequency, phase angle...
- How many variables?
  - Indexer does not have to calculate.
  - It just keeps the waves flowing
- Source
  - When the wave leaves its source, each element reacts according to its state.
  - The next one will know it and reject and begin reset.
  - Traverses as far as it needs or exits with error.

I have been trying to build the tree from the top down, starting at the root and spreading out from there. The actual way that it needs to be expressed is each individual as a seed, that grows into a tree, that becomes a forest... connecting to all the other "forests" out there.

The health of any forest is determined both by the health of its trees. In healthy forest ecosystems trees will communicate events between one another... and the receiver will react to this information.

In human terms, the individual is the seed that grows into a healthy adult, becoming a productive member of his community which co-exists in a symbiotic manner with the communities around.

## Information scarcity

What I have noticed in the last years, is that the information freely available is becoming scarcer. This was not done by privatising the internet itself but rather by privatising the information available on the public net. Once again we have the situation of control of the information by the elite. But it did not end there. Then began the campaign to discredit public sources of information. This was done by polluting the information that was flowing along the public channel.

An effect of this&mdash;perhaps an intended one&mdash;is that idiotic news appeals to idiots, and this generally starts a popular movement - any meme to express the outrage and frustration endemic amongst the oppressed class(es). Remember, the underclass does not necessarily have to oppressed. In fact, we are often the unsung heroes of many a triumph, with our quiet solitude and desire to just have a peaceful and happy life - not striving as those who already have too much seem to be constantly doing.

## Multi-dimensional being

Think of yourself as a multi-dimensional being. If that is too difficult for the question might arise as to what is a dimension actually - and the answer, as you can imagine, is not simple - then think of it as being pulled by numerous "attractors", like a cart that is pulled by lots of horses. Think of a habit as one of those pulls. An addiction is an unstoppable (omnipotent), or omni-present pull. Omnipotent - as in you being powerless in its grip.

When you change a habit or free yourself from an addiction, you have changed your "shape" in the world, and the attractions that were guiding/directing/pulling you, have changed. In other words, the very shape of your being has changed.

And if one part of the whole shape changes, then the whole shape itself will change. Thus your change will affect all those around you.

## Personal

Why show me the path, and then I die with never having revealed it? It is the way forward, it is the only reasonable future to hope for. For, if not that one, then what alternatives are there? A totalitarian regime, with absolute control over the whole of humanity? Or a bloody, chaotic descent into barely surviving pockets of humanity (if we survive the apocalypse)

---

## Action -> effect

Any action, even just by living, affects the environment. With this mass of people, anything we do at scale will significantly affect the environment - generally detrimentally.

To nourish ourselves and our own needs, we need energy - living energy. We need energy to live. We require energy for movement. In order to obtain that energy, we deplete resources.

Energy only appears when there is a differential - which means one gets nourished, while the other becomes depleted.

## Provide

Anything that "they" provide us, they can take away/remove. "They", the unknown ones, that hide in the shadows, wielding the sword of Damocles. Everything "they" provide comes at a price/cost to us, from which they benefit (and it seems, aften, finanacially).

## Human Interface

How human is the interface between the human and the AI/MI? This is not an AI problem, it is a human system interface (HIS - Human Interface to the System) problem.

Two levels:

1. Human level (anthropomorphic, narcissistic)
2. System level (objectification $$\Leftrightarrow$$ virtualisation)

Interface:

- where "consciousness", as a separate identity encounters the "non-conscious"

Empirical non-consciousness. It tracks dead (literally non-conscious) events. Based on data, i.e. measurement, recording, etc. which is non-human.

## Ground state

This information is gathered for the living entity which has to maintain a certain stasis/ground state or stable state, which would make it's form recognisable/perceivable.

## Non-human consciousness (NHC)

NHC is apparent in all species, in fact, in the world around us. However, we have a form of NHC which we have created (also could be thought of as the narrative that we overlay over reality to calm our fears).

We are so eager to embrace NHC, but have yet to acknowledge the trove we are surrounded by.

## Complex systems

A characteristic of complex systems is that they are self-organising. Which means that each element, including the element that contains all (or part) of these elements, "self" regulates, or regulates itself.

<p class="note">
{NOTE: This is a typical objectification, a separation. The same separation we often make between us & G-d - as something that exists outside of myself - which makes me "self" sovereign {sovereign to myself, and no one else}. We then have the option to reject or accept that outside element. Instead, we could accept that we are entangled, so much so, that it is difficult to tell the two &mdash; what is truly me & what is G-d &mdash; apart.}
</p>
The most important things to keep in mind are:

1. A perception of something is not the thing itself, but an "imaginary" or "made-up" version of the actual "thing".
2. There is not someone or something out there having an experience separate from your experience.. Although you could imagine such a thing, the only "experience" you can have of it, is your own "lived" - and therefore limited - experience of it.

## Nature

The closer to nature our lives are, not in that we all have to be pioneers, but that we are not living in contradiction or against the "laws of nature", the healthier and more effective our lives will be. Science tries to describe the natural processes, and then to emulate them&mdash;which is a form of control and of overcoming. Perhaps science should focus on working with the laws that it describes, rather than going against them.

It could bring us into a biblical frame of reference as going against the "Will of G-d". For if G-d is creator of this world, then it is through and by the processes that He has created that He Speaks to us. Thus it is the best to try and listen and hear what She has to say, and operate accordingly.

## Interactions

I see people interacting with one another in new way. The only gateway into that is to have shared revelatory/transcendent experiences. Then the work begins.

Similar to falling into a love relationship. It is a transcendent experience, but the real work is always in 3d. Dealing with the density and darkness of the 3d reality of the other, that is where we can manifest our connection.

## Bio-engineering

Because of our new found abilities to reform living organisms, if we do not have a strict moral code regulating this, we will produce abominations!

It could result in a whole new species, one never before considered, like the Brains&mdash;who embrace the space with a certain vibrational energy and thus form it = <b>בינה</b>.

## Economics

1. Economics of scarcity:
2. Economics of abundance:\_
   - Long tail\_

Whoever controls the resources controls the people. Thus the government will need to "set fiscal policy". Because of separation of the state and religion, it will have no moral, ethical nor spiritual basis. So in the end it will be ego driven, with a purely material goal, covered in a cloak of pseudo-idealism.
