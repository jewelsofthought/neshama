We are all pretending not to be in terror. Often by being too occupied with the "reality" of life and the many distractions thereof. There has to be someone, somewhere, sometime who has worked out the dynamics of the situation so at least he/she could help his/her descendants navigate these constantly flowing waters more capably.

In our desire to gain more control over our destinies, in a world that often seems chaotic and arbitrary, we place/accept a "system," overlay, one which we can grasp, that will provide us with a sense of continuity and control over the chaos of our existences.

And the most direct and clearly understood system is one of power. But gaining power costs you everything you are, and maintaining becomes who you are. She is a merciless and unforgiving mistress. But if you are truly in love with her and prove your allegiance, she will grant you everything you desire&mdash;but you will have to give her your heart... Don't worry about your soul&mdash;its punishment comes later.

Power only moves in one direction&mdash;toward itself. It loves only itself; like flames feed off and grow from other flames. But power, unless constrained, will continue to burn until there is nothing left to consume, ending up consuming itself and dying.

Pure power is limited in range, and costly to boot. Influence is much broader: making "believers" out of its followeres, then they will support you and give you the power you long for.

The combination of power and influence lays out the grid within which our lives are played out.

Within the realm of power and control, there can be no controller who controls the controls upon any society, except for G-d, the All Merciful. In most "real" cases, there is a group who execute the law, yet stand above it. In fact, the laws are there to ensure their excelusive position is maintained at all costs, and it is a servant to and of their whims.
