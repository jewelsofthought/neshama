## Hero's journey

Our journey begins on the inside, with the inner ‘I’, consistent with the view that we need to manifest our spiritual aspect in the material realm of consensual reality, rather than the other way round. This requires us first to awaken and become more consciousness of the effect we are having on the world around us. Thus begins the hero’s journey into the inner reaches of your own self – what we call the first soul, the _Nefesh_. That ‘I’ that I am in the world around me. However that is not the cause, not the first cause, and you will begin to understand that as you head deeper into the reaches of your inner being. There you encounter both forgiveness and responsibility. That you have to take responsibility for your part in what happened and is happening in your life – not the things you have no control over, but those that you do. Nevertheless, most certainly, you need to take full responsibility for your relationship with the “inevitable” events of your life.[^1] Those that seem to be part of your destiny. And believe me they are! For each one of us has a purpose, some big, some “small”, but just as it takes a village to make a village, so it will take the entire human population to fashion a global community.

Then you need to forgive yourself for what you have done that was not true to your inner purpose and will – as in “Thy will be done, in heaven as on earth”. This is the place of the second soul – _Ruach_. Within that is when you reach the court and there encounter the breath of the Divine Creator, the one we call King. It is when you begin to experience awe and deep understanding of how it is all connected, and we are all part of a purpose that is so beyond purpose that it leaves you breathless.

## The Template

What we need to understand, truly understand is that there is a template within which each one of us is born – we can even refer to as a Space – a space that has been granted each of us, and in this space we are “god”. We have been granted the right to do with it what we wish. Pollute it, destroy it, allow others to violate it. In this realm, we call it our body[^6] – the material manifestation of this space. It consists of the skin, the barrier, that divides the inside from the outside.[^7] Yet it is some-where in this body, in this space, that our consciousness lives.

So it continues out and in, above and below, large and small. Each atom is made from a template, whose measurements and behaviour we are still attempting to describe nowadays. The galaxies are formed in similar ways, and gravity is gravity, however you interact with it. But how accurate is our description or knowledge of what it actually is?[^2]

We, human beings, and all of life, in fact, all of creation, exist within the constraints of this template. That we cannot change.[^3] But we can create within the spaces of this template. The place of consciousness is that of an awareness of our existence within this creation, and the ability to remember, and thus make choices that will affect the unfolding of whatever we have created.

The food we eat cannot feed the soul. It is our relationship with food that will feed our soul. Our affinity to it. So it is with everything that we interact with. If we have a “soul- full” relationship with it, then it feeds our soul. If not , then it just feeds our desire for that food.

The step into the physical reality that we live in, is commitment. For commitments make the lines upon which our structures rely. Commitments used to be made with our word&mdash;we called it oaths and vows, when all a man had was his word. In fact creation begins with words “And He said... let there be light.”

Once we have commitment, we can begin to build the framework of life, begin shaping our lives. If we take action and connect with others who share our world view, one in which we believe that every relationship is sacred, we can begin to plant the seeds of this web of life.

The sacredness of life comes from the awareness of the connectedness of everything. That what you do to one, you do to all. “Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you”; “Love thy neighbour as thyself”; “Be kind unto the stranger.”

Holding this sacred principle, we can begin to form communities – communities of caring – and call them sacred communities.

The spiritual center of the community will be a sacred space, a place in which to recognise the areas of positive resonance, and those of negative resonance. The work then is to enable and support and encourage the manifestation of those positive areas in the lives of those affected, and work towards reducing the negative manifestations.

At the centre of the community, it core, so to speak will be a space, which is designated as the Temple, and it is dedicated to Truth. It carries the creed of “peace before truth”. Speak only if necessary, maintaining essential silence. Before speaking, consider the intention of your words. If you do speak, speak only the truth – or else pray instead for forgiveness and mercy.

That is the centre, the pillar around which all will stand.

In this sacred space, the deeper the truth spoken, the more we can know the person who speaks. In this way we create a communal space, within which to recognise the areas of positive resonance, and the work/service necessary to enable, support and encourage the manifestation of those areas in the lives of those affected.

There is a lot of talk nowadays of how we need to live,[^4] a long list of the things we need in order to live a good life.

On the physical side, it might be lots of money, and a big house and a nice car and a lovely wife and good children. On the emotional side it is to be kind, and caring, and loving and considerate. On the mental side, it is to be honourable, and true. On the spiritual side, it is to be humble and in service to the Divine, both within and without.[^5] “Love the Lord with your heart and your soul”.

We have a lot of information and many people speaking of what needs to be done. However, there are still yet not enough of us doing it. It is similar to what the nutritionists and food shamans tell us. We know we should not eat that “bad for me” food, yet we still indulge, even over-indulge. That is the difference between knowing and doing. It is made up of “I can’t because ...” Let's become a nation of doers. Let us stand up, all of us that believe in a different way of living, and relating to the earth, and begin to do it.

A spiritual flame consists of showing people how to do something that is more aligned with their experience of the Sacred.[^8] We know that perhaps the quintessential element in this time that needs repairing is our relationship with our Mother Earth. That will begin with our food. That which the Mother offers us and provides us, as long as we honour her – as is said in the litany: “If you will follow My commandments, you will have rain in the season, and your crops will grow, and your trees will bear fruit.” As long as the flame burns, so it provide nourishment to the body and the spirit of the people.

The journey starts from first principles. That first principle says that we are made both of body and of spirit. It is an acknowledgement of Spirit. Once we acknowledge that, we can then begin to investigate the Sciences of the Sacred which contain the Wisdom of our Ancestors.

We begin to create communities – communities of caring – and call them sacred communities, and these communities are made up of affinity groups. Small groups of people who “like” one another, and are willing to make a commitment to meet every week.

Start each meeting with an acknowledgement of Spirit in whichever way that is meaningful to all. In other words express the movement from the mundane to the Sacred, the passing through the _Machsom_, the barrier, that sits between the two. Like the skin, that separates, and thus both blocks and protects, the inner parts of your body from the outer.

End each meeting with a blessing of gratitude to those Spirits that gathered to help and protect and guide this meeting.

The tenet of the meeting is around the manifestation of a (w)holistic life.

## Food & Water

Start with the food and the water. Reams has been said and written on this topic. From the nutritional to the spiritual, not ignoring the emotional nor the mental aspects of our food and the manner in which we absorb the nutrition and the effect it has upon us.

This, in itself, will produce a change in everything. In order to obtain organic and free-range food, will require a change of lifestyle, it will feed those who have also embarked on a spiritual path. What we require from them is that they too will be part of the community or at least the web of communities.

I will not even begin to speak of the effort that it might take to ensure that we all have good water to drink. Because at this stage most water that we drink is no longer free. In fact we have sunk so low, that we drink it out of bottles in which they have been confined. I would suggest that we drink more water, and less adulterated water in the form of soda’s, or caffeinated drinks, etc. Once that has been achieved, then the hunt is on to find pure water, water that itself has been less adulterated by human interference than most of our tap water.

Similar to the concept of Kosher or Halaal, where we restrict ourselves to “spiritually” acceptable food, and never indulge in food that is not “kosher”, that is firstly, physically harmful, and secondly spiritually inappropriate.
If we focus on these aspect of our lives, these very practical and essential items, many things will begin to change right there. Even if you are practising this, there is probably still some room for improvement – or for service. Helping others attain this; making it easier for each of us to obtain this food, etc, etc.

## Collaboration, not competition

Collaboration, not only competition, needs to be a basic principle of each of the communities. With this, we can begin to build cohesion. At least being in agreement of what it means in relation to the food that we eat and that we produce to be “honouring the earth and the creatures of the earth.”

Though all of this might seem a far of dream and even idealistic too many.

So let me get more prosaic, and call on pure common sense, of which it seems many are just lacking. It is not about wars, and weapons and pollution, etc, but on carrying out actions and supposing a lifestyle that is destructive to both yourself and your environment. And it is very likely that much of what is making us sick is also toxic to our environment.

Now I could ask the question why in the name of all that is holy would someone want to poison himself? Well there are a number of reasons, and even necessary reasons, though if deemed unnecessary, one would call it an addiction.

I realise we are not perfect and we make mistakes, but it is not the mistake that is the issue, it is the not rectifying it, or trying to improve that becomes the sin, what we would call dishonourable behaviour.

Now, if there are pesticides, which are poisons, in my food, why would I eat that, if all things being equal, I had a choice? Now, there might be a percentage that could find it appealing and continue with the poisoned food, but that would only be a small percentage.

Surely it makes sense to eat things that come from the earth, and are grown with the minimum of human inputs? Though this might vary from place to place, and thus different solutions might be appropriate for different circumstances, I still don't understand how economically it is cheaper to sell processed food rather than unprocessed?

So this economic system obviously incentives the processing of food, and not the growing and distribution of unprocessed foodstuffs. I believe we have the capacity to change this, and we can only do it together, through an organised network of collaborators.
