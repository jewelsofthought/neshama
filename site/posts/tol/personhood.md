## Sovereignty

I do not agree to allow anyone else to own my sovereignty. I want to be sovereign in my own personal space as well as a recognised sovereignty when interacting with the society and communities around me. This fundamental sovereignty has to be recognised in this world and in any other to which I have any relationship whatsoever.

I claim this right as a living being on this planet. I refer to this sovereign right as "individuality", and that I have the right to be recognised as an individual, having an individual existence, and with certain unaliable rights within any society.

In fact, rather than having to claim that right, I question who has the right to exploit that individuality for his or her own purposes? It seems that looking at the history of such abrogation of human rights was carried out by the powerful preying on the weak. It is their right by their might, and that is simply not right!

The paradox inherent in this theft of our rights is that it is we who bring that upon ourselves - for it is you and I who carry out such theft, through our actions, and through us supporting and obeying the dictates of those who wish to control and exploit us. And when deemed no longer useful, or in any way blocking or preventing them from achieving their aims, they will simply brush us aside - sometimes by the millions!

[Hitler: 6m; Stalin 15m+; Khymer Rouge: 2m; 59m chinese homeless from floods; over 1m refugees from Syria, etc, etc, etc...]

I claim this I that I am, and space in which I live - within a society that seeks a positive outcome for its I's, the members - and flourish.

## Compromise

In the physical world, a reason to give up/compromise one's sovereign rights, might be because there is not enough room for all of us - and thus "living quarters are getting cramped".

Is the only answer culling? And if that is the case, then would there not be enough people - especially amongst the old - who would be willing to voluntarily sacrifice themselves for the good of all?

The caveat to this is that there are those people, generally evil people, who will do anything to prolong their lives - including drinking blood potions of various sorts...

While there seems to be no limit to individual greed, there seems to be natural limits on communal greed - from both internal and external pressures.

As the horizontal expansion reaches its limits, the only direction to then expand is vertically - or in this case virtually. For even though there might be limits to expansion In the physical world - they say that there are not enough resources. Yet, that is not true in the virtual world. There is enough space and resources for every one of us to have a fully sovereign id. In fact, I believe that many of us have the individual computing resources and access to be able to organise that ourselves.

Finally, they say there is not enough money... which equates to resources. Well, that is a old joke. The truth is that there is never enough money for what we want or need, yet always enough what their cronies are excited by. The sad part of it, is that it seems to be equated simply with the acquisition of money (virtual or not) as the primary directive of life. And that is truly disappointing - the best that we, as a people, could come up with...

## Appeal

I realise that most of us are not techie enough to achieve this. But firstly I am appealing to all of you who wish to have a private, autonomous and safe existence in cyber space need to want to achieve this.

If this is the case, then it would require a communal effort - with the backing of the techies - to achieve. Something that every organisation is striving for. For they realise the value of keep their data and their doing safe in cyber space. So should we!

It is possible to create digital ids which would place you firmly as a entity in cyberspace. Almost like a registration. Then, it is possible to create a operating system environment - like an alarm system on your home - which would create a safe basis. Then, there are methods with which to secure all the applications you are used to using, with minor modifications.

Finally, to traverse the public internet, the open cyberspace, safely and securely, though more difficult, can also be done. For us, with more limited resources, it might be a slower and more circuitous route - but if there is something you do not want to share publicly or with the authorities, it is possible and preferable.

BEWARE! We need to do this, ASAP! Already there are repercussions occurring to the people who are posting on public forums... And if we continue to do so, we do so at your own peril!
