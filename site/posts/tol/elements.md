## Boundaries

The basic problem with this approach is the mixing of drugs with the children – it is bound(ary)less. And to expose young (pre-pubescent) children to drugs – any drugs – is a form of paedophilia – similar to exposing young children to sex.

So when the mother wishes to indulge in her recreational activity, she leaves the child, and proceeds to indulge. She does not take a toke on the joint that is going around the room with the infant on her lap!

Even while breast-feeding, it is questionable.

That is what has prevented the so-called “hippy” revolution from succeeding in changing the world.

No sane person will accept this way of life in its entirety. There have to be agreed upon boundaries – and regarding those boundaries, we need to be united. Not all in agreement as to the reasons and history of our arrival at those boundaries. And most of them would make sense to most of humanity – as least, most of humanities “masses” - the undeclared, under-represented, constrained masses.

## Blueprint

And that is R’ Sacks’ point regarding the Torah and Talmud. What I would call, the first blueprint, and one that has survived the vicissitudes of the ages, and thus has been expanded and constantly tuned & attuned/updated throughout these millennia being the bedrock of a living faith.

It is a framework, containing all the elements necessary to herald in the World to come – for it cannot emerge until we “invite” it to the banquet, that is, are willing and able to receive it. We need to redesign the template to reflect the needs of our present time – which may not have been those of the times in which this blueprint emerged.

For example, in the time of the Torah, the need to procreate for survival was of utmost importance, and thus much of the culture reflected that. Today, we are bordering on over population – we are reaching the maximum carrying capacity of spaceship earth, and thus need to practice more constraint in the procreation of our species.

Meat has been a staple for many people throughout the ages. Now the impact of a meat-based agriculture on our planet is becoming alarming, and we need to practice more care and awareness as to the consequences of slaughtering billions of animals each year.

## Mother

The Queen Mother needs to teach the prince what it is to be a king.
But his Queen is the one who guides and teaches him to be a true King.
She creates the personal space in which he is nourished (or depleted!).

The role of mother is to secure the child’s daemon.

Once his daemon is secure, no woman will be able to bond with him without acknowledging or knowing his daemon. Our blessing is that he not encounter a false woman who has the sight, but uses it to entrap or manipulate him. In the name of the Almighty G-d we ask for His Guidance and Mercy.
