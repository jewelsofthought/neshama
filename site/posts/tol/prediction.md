## The Future

This is the way of the future, or else there will be another round of the same game. There is no need to argue the points, to justify them. We call it common sense - I call it the Truth of the Moment. We are conscious beings, not "mindless" genes transferring information. Thus we have a choice&mdash;whether to receive the information (and which information to receive, from whom or what) and whether to transmit the information (and which information to transmit, to whom or what.)

Thus you can receive this information - and decide what to do with it. But this is what is needed to be done.

1. No more private property.
2. Transactions will no longer be measured in static numerical fiat currency, but in units of energy i.e joules & potential energy (pe).
   Just as we have a reserve currency and a value currency...
   This will require two measurments:
   (i) Work done (production)
   (ii) Potential for work: This will cover research, ideas, etc.
   I am not sure how to measure creativity. ie art, etc.
3. All interactions that affect an area greater than the immediate neighbourhood will be public - that is fully revealed. (Transparent)
