## Together We Stand

> The highest form of giving is when the giver is unknown and the beneficiary is unknown.

It is time for the sleepers to awaken. For years we have been lurking in the shadows, looking, watching, participating, but seeing its faults and becoming more and more distant from this absurd theatre. These bombastic leaders of our societies, playing a game of their making, while the people shudder in dread at the fear of having no food and shelter. Millions suffer deprivation while trillions are spent are vapourware.

Their weakness is two-fold. The first is their rigidity, and the second is their need for (centralised) control. Thus, naturally producing a rigid, vertical economy.

Thus we must be like the water, and move like the wind. We appear where we are needed, and then disperse back into the shadows. We do not need to be known. We do not seek fame, our names heralded across the banners of the globe.

There is work to be done, and we the engineers, and designers and visionaries of the world, wherever you are, and whoever you are, need to begin to do the work.

The essence of the path has to be sharing and collaboration. Together we stand, divided we fall.
