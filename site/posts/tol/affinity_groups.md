## Groups

The individual, besides being extremely vulnerable alone in the world, starts off completely helpless. In order to survive, he will need a support structure, a group.

We emerge (in the normal case), into a family. In a peaceful family, we would have parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts & uncles and cousins. A child in a normal family, would have 2 parents and 4 grandparents to support him, plus any siblings. That is his immediate "nuclear family". Today, it has shrunk to just a parent, shared amongst any siblings (creating intense sibling rivalries), as the father and the grandparents are often absent. And to increase the complexity, often the siblings are from a different parent.

If there are 2 siblings on average, the size of the family will be 8, and the greater family body (including aunts, uncles, etc), will be an additional 8 or so members, making up a family body of 16 members.

If there are 4 siblings on average, it will produce a family size of 10, and the greater body will consist of an additional 32 members, making up a family body of around 40 members. Quite a unit!

If there were 8 siblings on average, it will produce a family size of 14, and the greater body will consist of additional 96 members, making a "tribe" of over a hundred people.

I have lived in a community of 150 members, and it was a tightly knit community - but fraught with many of the same challenges as a large urbanised society - except on a smaller scale. I sometimes think of the size of Jacob's family. They say 70 members went down to Egypt, but those are only the names of the nobles and princes. There were servants

My point here being that we cannot survive as individuals, nor can we survive as autonomous beings. We are dependent on huge support from the communities that surround us, including the "lesser" beings - the animals, insects, birds, virii, bacteria, fungi, etc... As the family support structure has been reduced to 2, so we now have to build our "spiritual" families. Those with whom we have "soul" - not necessarily cultural, social, racial or other, connection. What I refer to as "affinity groups".

## Peer (Affinity) Groups

Perhaps an effective way would be to group the citizens in small peer groups of 10 [+/-2]. [with proxies/shadows - that will make 16 - 24] [12 shown to be max. amount for efficient meetings.]

This group could form the basic unit. This would have a number of advantages. It would collectivise the voices, but only enough to reduce the amount of white noise. Generally, the excesses/prejudices would either be smoothed out, or become very apparent. The irrelevant should be weeded out easily before issues are made "public".

From this unit, a web, a communications and sharing network can be grown organically. If the group can deal with the issues it encounters, then it is required (even obligated) to deal with them, and not bother the rest. If the group cannot, then it asks for help from the next group (which would naturally comprise of 10 [+/-2] [with proxies/shadows] groups of 10 peer groups. The members of this group is made up of 1 [+1] members of each of the connected groups&mdash;forming a kind of a star.

- Bottom-Up: The impulse from below has to be the dynamic flow of decisions. The needs are expressed from the lowest level and move upwards accordingly. The upper levels facilitate the needs of the people, who form the beginning, the source of all flow. Otherwise the flow has been subverted and diverted for only a select group or groups.
