## Hero's journey

Our journey begins on the inside, with the inner 'I', consistent with the view that we need to manifest our spiritual aspect in the material realm of consensual reality, rather than the other way round. This requires us first to awaken and become more consciousness of the effect we are having on the world around us. Thus begins the hero's journey into the inner reaches of your own self – what we call the first soul, the _Nefesh_. That 'I' that I am in the world around me. However that is not the cause, not the first cause, and you will begin to understand that as you head deeper into the reaches of your inner being. There you encounter both forgiveness and responsibility. That you have to take responsibility for your part in what happened and is happening in your life – not the things you have no control over, but those that you do. Nevertheless, most certainly, you need to take full responsibility for your relationship with the "inevitable" events of your life.[^1] Those that seem to be part of your destiny. And believe me they are! For each one of us has a purpose, some big, some "small", but just as it takes a village to make a village, so it will take the entire human population to fashion a global community.

Then you need to forgive yourself for what you have done that was not true to your inner purpose and will – as in "Thy will be done, in heaven as on earth". This is the place of the second soul – _Ruach_. Within that is when you reach the court and there encounter the breath of the Divine Creator, the one we call King. It is when you begin to experience awe and deep understanding of how it is all connected, and we are all part of a purpose that is so beyond purpose that it leaves you breathless.

## The Template

What we need to understand, truly understand is that there is a template within which each one of us is born – we can even refer to as a Space – a space that has been granted each of us, and in this space we are "god". We have been granted the right to do with it what we wish. Pollute it, destroy it, allow others to violate it. In this realm, we call it our body[^6] – the material manifestation of this space. It consists of the skin, the barrier, that divides the inside from the outside.[^7] Yet it is some-where in this body, in this space, that our consciousness lives.

So it continues out and in, above and below, large and small. Each atom is made from a template, whose measurements and behaviour we are still attempting to describe nowadays. The galaxies are formed in similar ways, and gravity is gravity, however you interact with it. But how accurate is our description or knowledge of what it actually is?[^2]

We, human beings, and all of life, in fact, all of creation, exist within the constraints of this template. That we cannot change.[^3] But we can create within the spaces of this template. The place of consciousness is that of an awareness of our existence within this creation, and the ability to remember, and thus make choices that will affect the unfolding of whatever we have created.

The food we eat cannot feed the soul. It is our relationship with food that will feed our soul. Our affinity to it. So it is with everything that we interact with. If we have a "soul- full" relationship with it, then it feeds our soul. If not , then it just feeds our desire for that food.

The step into the physical reality that we live in, is commitment. For commitments make the lines upon which our structures rely. Commitments used to be made with our word&mdash;we called it oaths and vows, when all a man had was his word. In fact creation begins with words "And He said... let there be light."

Once we have commitment, we can begin to build the framework of life, begin shaping our lives. If we take action and connect with others who share our world view, one in which we believe that every relationship is sacred, we can begin to plant the seeds of this web of life.
