> The Great Schism of 1054 marked the first major split in the history of Christianity, separating the Orthodox Church in the East from the Roman Catholic Church in the West. Until this time, all of Christendom existed under one body.

> At the heart of the break was the Roman popeâ€™s claim to universal jurisdiction and authority. The Orthodox Church in the East had agreed to honour the pope but believed that ecclesiastical matters should be decided by a council of bishops, and therefore, would not grant unchallenged dominion to the pope.

This is ongoing and emerged today as the War in Ukraine. The dynamic is one in which the Pope (and his descendants) rules. At this point there is an "executive" battle between the Pope and all that he represents, and the Corporate Illuminati, and all they represent.

> The two branches remained on friendly terms until crusaders of the Fourth Crusade captured Constantinople in 1204. To this day, the schism has not been wholly mended.

It is like the situation with the USA & Russia who were on friendly terms post the Soviet era, and then through the War in Ukraine, one side abrogates any agreements that maintained communication between the two participants.

> One of the initial factors which caused a shifting apart of the two domains was language. The primary language in the West was Latin, while the dominant language in the East was Greek.

This affected both the science and the philosophy. As the people of the East were reading most Greek texts in the original, whilst the West were reading the Latin translations. It must have also affected education. There is also a line back to the West, as during the Dark Ages most of the Greek culture and philosophy was lost to the West. It was only through the Arabian culture that they recovered it. And the Moslems inherited that from the Eastern Orthodox Churches, who had maintained their Greek background, and had not gone through such a period of persecution as had been experienced in the West.
