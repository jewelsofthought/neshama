## Buying Co-Op

For many years, ever since I was a young man, I could not understand why there was such a paucity of collectives that organised around the needs of local groups. I suppose, my current hypothesis, is that this is a threat to the dominance of the the elements of centralised power, which are seldom, if ever, about the needs of the people, but more concerned with maintaining the status quo.

## Corporation & Co-operation

Does not a corporation allow for, in fact, encourage co-operation? Does a corporation not live or die according to the level of co-operation amongst its members? Where has this been hidden? Why are we not more aware of this? Is this not subverted under the banner of the "true" character of the corporation in a capitalist economy, that of the need to constantly make a profit, or so we have been led to believe.

## Corporation & Self-rule

Is that not essentially what a corporation is? And is not a coorporation allowed complete self-rule - in other words, it can decide how to run itself. It could structured upon socialist or equal rights, perhaps a sharing internal economy, with autonomy and empowerment encouraged at all levels. People refer to a Kibbutz structure as a socialist one, but could not a corporation in essence be a socialist organisation?
