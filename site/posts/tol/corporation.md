## Buying Co-Op

For many years, ever since I was a young man, I could not understand why there was such a paucity of collectives that organised around the needs of local groups. I suppose, my current hypothesis, is that this is a threat to the dominance of the the elements of centralised power, which are seldom, if ever, about the needs of the people, but more concerned with maintaining the status quo.

## Corporation & Co-operation

Does not a corporation allow for, in fact, encourage co-operation? Does a corporation not live or die according to the level of co-operation amongst its members? Where has this been hidden? Why are we not more aware of this? Is this not subverted under the banner of the "true" character of the corporation in a capitalist economy, that of the need to constantly make a profit, or so we have been led to believe.

## Corporation & Self-rule

Is that not essentially what a corporation is? And is not a coorporation allowed complete self-rule - in other words, it can decide how to run itself. It could structured upon socialist or equal rights, perhaps a sharing internal economy, with autonomy and empowerment encouraged at all levels. People refer to a Kibbutz structure as a socialist one, but could not a corporation in essence be a socialist organisation?

## Rosh HaShana 2022

> Those that control the resources, control the game.

Moved from nobles (land), to bureaucrats (nation state), to corporations (capital). Each one introduced their set of laws, and those that followed just expanded on that original set, incorporating the laws that benefited it, and scrapping or amending those that did not. At present, money/capital has become the medium of control of the resources.

Many might argue that a capital economy has always existed. As long as there is money or items of value that represent trade, there is capitalism. However, prior to the modern era&mdash;one which we could label neo-liberal capitalism&mdash;there were other other priorities influencing it. As capitalism arose, and the corporations gained legitimacy, the search for capital became the only criterion.

When capitalism first arose as a driving force in society, it was far more diverse and enabled many people to rise from poverty. It naturally become more centralised very quickly. You did not have to own (or control) the whole market. You just need to have sufficient resources &ndash; beyond a certain threshold &ndash; of the marked (eg. Morgan-Stanley, Rockefeller, etc.). Over time their reach would expand, eventually becoming a small group (nepotism) of families that controlled these corporation that had expanded to control the majority of more than one market, with the goal of increasing their control, and thus their profits. We have seen this occur in multiple industries, from the oil industry, to the steel, mining, computers, electricity, agriculture, arms, and many other, industries... until there would be one, or possibly a small group of oligarchs that would control the majority of the worlds resources (Blackrock, Vanguard, etc). These resources include soft resources like transportation, communication networks, media, etc.

One that has been achieved&mdash;with the help of compliant judicial and political systems, who aid in the manipulation and the coercion of society, generally through the control of information via the media&mdash;the move for total control will commence.

What a wonderful vision. Many of us in this period dreamed of a better world, but most of us who had that vision did not have the means or resources to implement it. But what if you did? What if you were a scion of a powerful family, like the Rockefellers or Bill Gates, or Soros? Would you not try and implement a plan of so that you and your descendants could continue to live this blessed life of privilege and relative luxury? Do we not already do it?

The first question you would ask would be what is the carrying capacity of such a system? How many people would be the optimum load. It seems that perhaps the Georgia Guidestones might have expressed that. And just on that note, to reduce the human population from 7.5 billion to 600,000 is going to require genocide on a massive scale, as well as cause huge disclocation, suffering and hardship for a large portion of the population.

You would divide people the people into three categories. The elite, who had full access and full privileges. Then there would be the workers, those that serve the elite, and are useful to maintaining the state of this elite. Their conditions will depend on their usefulness. Then we have the useless people &ndash; those who did not provide any value to the ruling class, and those need to be removed from the environment, unless they can provide some entertainment for this ruling class.

> In order to survie the coming epoch, you will need to make yourself useful to your masters.

You will need to serve them body and soul, or else you will be extinguished with no appeal, as it will most likely be decided by AI. You will just not be permitted to access any societal resources.

No doubt it is a visionary world that they (this elite) envision. It is a world in which there is a steady population, with resources to match. There will be quality of life available for those that comprise this elite.

However, unless the same AI is used to control the elite, there will always be social and other warfare amongst them.

This visionary idyll can only b e managed successfully if the rulers all obey the same credo, one which has evolved from the spiritual traditions of people. A multi-coloured flame that will arise from the voice of the true mystics. It will rise separately in different part of the world, until it will eventually merge into a synod, made up of all those spiritual expressions.

> Because the Truth is the same in every corner of the world.

It remains hidden for now, so that it may sprout when the time is right and the people are ready.

We cannot live in a place of dissonacne, looking backwards to create something in our future that is not a repeat of the past.

No!

We have to step into a future which his built on our near persent. We have AI, electricity, rainbow people, chemicals and plastics, etc. We have so many things which we did not have when these books were writtine, including knowledge, philosophies, et c. We did not have science and statistics (numbers) then. TThese books provide a clear picture of the spiritual, but they cannot provide us with the forms/practices we need for our present material existence. (Examples: _Kashrut_ & _chashmal_/fire)

We have to find the wisdom and the seers that can guide us to what we need to do.

Thus, I beseech you O Lord, Our G-d, to help us (me) find the source that will lead me into this new world. I know we have the knowledge and technology to create this balance&mdash;which cannot be static, but has to be dynamic&mdash;based on להנאת הבורה, for Your Pleasure, and for life. It was easy when the most important thing in one's life was children. Now it is purely about life and my special spiritual purpose, the purpose of my life, to serve Creation and its Creator.
