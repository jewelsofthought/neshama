## Together We Stand

> The highest form of giving is when the giver is unknown and the beneficiary is unknown.

It is time for the sleepers to awaken. For years we have been lurking in the shadows, looking, watching, participating, but seeing its faults and becoming more and more distant from this absurd theatre. These bombastic leaders of our societies, playing a game of their making, while the people shudder in dread at the fear of having no food and shelter. Millions suffer deprivation while trillions are spent are vapourware.

Their weakness is two-fold. The first is their rigidity, and the second is their need for (centralised) control. Thus, naturally producing a rigid, vertical economy.

Thus we must be like the water, and move like the wind. We appear where we are needed, and then disperse back into the shadows. We do not need to be known. We do not seek fame, our names heralded across the banners of the globe.

There is work to be done, and we the engineers, and designers and visionaries of the world, wherever you are, and whoever you are, need to begin to do the work.

The essence of the path has to be sharing and collaboration. Together we stand, divided we fall.

## Multi-dimensional being

=======
>>>>>>> 952b01a (From Work/Tol/Draw)
Think of yourself as a multi-dimensional being. If that is too difficult, as the question might arise, what is a dimension actually - and the answer, as you can imagine, is not simple, then think of it as being pulled by numerous "attractors", like a cart, that is pulled by lots of horses. Think of a habit as one of those pulls. An addiction is an unstoppable (omnipotent), or omni-present pull. Omnipotent - as in you being powerless in its grip.

When you change a habit or free yourself from an addiction, you have changed your "shape" in the world, and the attractions that were guiding/directing/pulling you, have changed. In other words, the very shape of your being has changed.

And if one part of the whole shape changes, then the shape itself (generally) will change. Thus your change will affect all those around you.

## Personal

Why show me the path, and then I die with never having revealed it? It is the way forward, it is the only reasonable future to hope for. For, if not that one, then what alternatives are there? A totalitarian regime, with absolute control over the whole of humanity? Or a bloody, chaotic descent into barely surviving pockets of humanity (if we survive the apocalypse)

---

## Action -> effect

Any action, just by living, we affect the environment. With this mass of people, anything we do at scale will significantly affect the environment - generally detrimentally.

By nourishing ourselves&mdash;our own needs&mdash;, and using that energy - living energy - we deplete resources. We need energy to live. We require energy for movement. In order to obtain that energy, we deplete resources.
Energy only appears when there is a differential - which means one gets nourished, while the other becomes depleted.

## Quadrant

Depending in which quadrant you stand, one pair will be supportive, the other detrimental to the one in the quadrant.

The quadrant consists of "more/less", "increase/decrease".

Only at close to the maximum of "more", is decrease a positive. Any other place, an increase is good... unless what is being increased is not good!
<<<<<<< HEAD
Then increase is a negative.

Then increase is a negative.}
