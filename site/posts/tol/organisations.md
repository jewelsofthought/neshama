## Network of Communities

Vision of an international network of sustainable communities, sharing knowledge, labour and know-how, as well as resources. Similar to the kibbutz movement. The communities can be both urban and rural. They can consist of a shared household, or a collection of houses, creating a sub-culture that practices sustainable living.

Travel from one community to another, always encountering similar situations, regarding food, etc. Each community would specialise in one aspect of the shift. People will travel to one of those communities to live and work and learn certain skills, as well as meeting people who are associated with the network.

This will help with the cloistered aspect of communities, also helping the communities who need energy and support from and to the outside.

## Web of Trust

All organisations consist of a webs of trust that are interacting with other webs. These webs are made up of affinity groups. This affinity can be on many different levels. It could be financial, it could be familial, it could be philosophical, cultural, or religious.

Take your friends, for instance. The people you are close to, and whom you share parts of your life. They form an affinity group that you are part of. That group might be connected to another pod in a web that might consist of an organisation like a department in a university, or a project team that are part of a project that is occurring in a corporation, and so on outwards, further and further.
We are all connected via these strands that connect us all, making the tapestry of our lives and the human race itself.

If this is so, you might ask, then what is the element that we speak of that we would like to insert into this web within web that already exists? It is one of consciousness. Of becoming conscious of these interactions, and what is occurring.

There are many articles that have been written about these webs since the WWW arose. They explore this concept that all organisational structures, structures that manifest a certain coherency, and thus are all networks of some form. Webs are networks, trees are networks, blood vessels are networks, lungs are networks, even forests consist of webs of interactions.

## Our journey

Our journey begins on the inside, with the inner **‘I’**, consistent with the view that we need to manifest our spiritual aspect in the material realm of consensual reality, rather than the other way round. This requires us first to awaken and become more consciousness of the effect we are having on the world around us. Thus begins the hero’s journey into the inner reaches of your own self – what we call the first soul, the _Nefesh_. That **‘I’** that I am in the world around me. However that is not the cause, not the first cause, and you will begin to understand that as you head deeper into the reaches of your inner being. There you encounter both forgiveness and responsibility. That you have to take responsibility for your part in the things that have happened, and what is presently happening in your life – not the things you have no control over, but those that you do. Nevertheless, most certainly, you need to take full responsibility for your relationship with the “inevitable” events of your life.1 Those that seem to be part of your destiny. And believe me they are! For each one of us has a purpose, some big, some “small”, but just as it takes a village to make a village, so it will take the entire human population to fashion a global community.

Then you need to forgive yourself for what you have done that was not true to your inner purpose and will – as in “Thy will be done, in heaven as on earth”. This is the place of the second soul – Ruach. That is when you enter the court and there encounter the breath of the Divine Creator, the one we call King. It is when you begin to experience awe and deep understanding of how it is all connected, and that we are all part of a purpose that is so beyond purpose that it leaves you breathless.

What we need to understand, truly understand is that there is a template within which each one of us is born – we can even refer to as a Space – a space that has been granted each of us, and in this space we are “divine”. We have been granted the right to do with it what we wish. Pollute it, destroy it, allow others to violate it. In this realm, we call it our body – the material manifestation of this space. It consists of the skin, the barrier, that divides the inside from the outside. Yet it is some-where in this body, in this space, that our consciousness lives. Where is this place? Each of us is an version of this template, both inside and outside. Each one of us is formed from the same template, perhaps you can think of it as the same idea.

This continues out and in, above and below, large and small. Each atom is made from a template, whose measurements and behaviour we think, are quite well described nowadays. The galaxies are formed in similar ways, and gravity is gravity, however you interact with it. But how accurate is our description or knowledge of what it actually is?2

We, human beings, and all of life, in fact all of creation, exist within the constraints of this template. That we cannot change.3 But we can be whatever we wish within the spaces of this template – the space of which we are conscious. That is the place of choice.

We eat to feed the body. Food cannot feed the soul. It is then our relationship with the food that will feed the soul. Our affinity to it. So it is with everything that we interact act with. If we have a “soul- full” relationship with it, then it feeds our soul. If not , then it goes to some other place... what that is we can speak of at another time, for that is not the topic under discussion, but that of creating the seeds of the web that I wish to speak of. These are the heart spaces from which these seeds will come.

Commitment is to step into the physical reality that we live in. They define the lines, the limits, which form the foundations upon which our structures rely. Commitments used to be made with our word - we called them oaths and vows, when all a man had was his word. In fact creation begins with words “And He said... let there be light.”

Once we have commitment, we can begin building the Tree of Life, from whose fruit new life will be seeded. If we make a commitment to connecting with others who believe that every relationship is sacred. A sacredness that comes from the awareness of the Oneness of everything, expressed in knowing that everything is connected. That everything you do has consequences, and nothing exists in a vacuum.

## Sacred communities.

At the centre of the community, it core, so to speak will be a space, which is designated as the Temple, and it is dedicated to Truth. It also carries the creed of “peace before truth”. Speak only if necessary, maintaining essential silence. And if you speak, consider the effect of your words. But if you do speak, speak only the truth – or else pray instead for forgiveness and mercy.

That is the centre, the pillar around which all will stand.

In this sacred space, the deeper the truth spoken, the more we can know the person who speaks. In this way we create a communal space, within which to recognise the areas of positive resonance, and the work/service necessary to enable, support and encourage the manifestation of those areas in the lives of those affected.

There is a lot of talk nowadays of the ideal way of life. There is a huge debate on what makes the ideal lifestyle.[^4] On the physical side, it might be to have lots of money, and a big house and a nice car and a lovely wife and good children.
On the emotional side it is to have a loving family and caring supportive community. On the mental side, is to do something meaningful or challenging. On the spiritual side, it is to be honour, obey and serve the Divine, both within and without.[^5]

With this plethora of information, many people are starting to ask difficult questions about the fruits of this way of life that we are in, or heading towards, realise that something needs to be done to change the direction we are heading in.

We may be feeling totally overwhelmed, and disempowered. This is because there are still not enough of us. The “thoughts” have not yet reached critical mass. Similar to what nutritionists tell us. Even though we know we should not eat “bad” food, we still indulge, even over-indulge – until we encounter a health crises. That is the difference between knowing and doing. It is made up of “I can’t because ...” Let us stand up, all of us that believe in a different way of living, and relating to the earth, and begin to do it.

## Temple meeting

Start each meeting with an acknowledgement of Spirit in whichever way that is meaningful to all. In other words express the movement from the mundane to the Sacred, the passing through the Machsom, the barrier, that sits between the two. Like the skin, that separates, and thus both blocks and protects, the inner parts of your body from the outer.

And end each gathering with a blessing of gratitude to those Spirits that gathered to help and protect and guide the gathering.

We gather to talk of and plan actions in order to envisage, and collaborate in creating spaces and platforms that facilitate a more (w)holistic lifestyle.

### Start with the food & water

Start with the food and the water. Reams has been said and written on this topic. From the nutritional to the spiritual, not ignoring the emotional nor the mental aspects of our food and the manner in which we absorb the nutrition and the effect it has upon us.

This, in itself, will produce a change in everything. In order to obtain organic and free-range food, will require a change of lifestyle, it will feed those who have also embarked on a spiritual path. What we require from them is that they too will be part of the community or at least the web of communities.

I will not even begin to speak of the effort that it might take to ensure that we all have good water to drink. Because at this stage most water that we drink is no longer free. In fact we have sunk so low, that we drink it out of plastic bottles in which they have been confined. I would suggest that we drink more cress water, and less adulterated water in the form of soda’s, or caffeinated drinks, etc. Once that has been achieved, then the hunt is on to find pure water, water that itself has been less adulterated by human interference than most of our tap water.

Similar to the concept of _Kosher_ or _Halaal_, where we restrict ourselves to “spiritually” acceptable food, and never indulge in food that is not “kosher”, that is firstly, physically harmful, and secondly spiritually inappropriate.

If we focus on these aspect of our lives, these very practical and essential items, many things will begin to change right there. Even if you are practicing this, there is probably still some room for improvement – or for service. Helping others attain this; making it easier for each of us to obtain this food, etc, etc.

## Collaboration, not competition

Collaboration, not only competition, needs to be a basic principle of each of the communities. With this, we can begin to build cohesion. At least being in agreement of what it means in relation to the food that we eat and that we produce to be “honouring the earth and the creatures of the earth.”

Though all of this might seem a far of dream and even idealistic too many.

Let me get more prosaic, and call on pure common sense, of which it seems many are just lacking. It is not about wars, and weapons and pollution, etc, but on carrying out actions and supposing a lifestyle that is destructive to both yourself and your environment. It is very likely that much of what is making us sick is also toxic to our environment.

I could ask the question why in the name of all that is holy would someone want to poison himself? Well there are a number of reasons, and even necessary reasons, though if deemed unnecessary, one would call it an addiction.

I realise we are not perfect and we make mistakes, but it is not the mistake that is the issue, it is the not rectifying it, or trying to improve that becomes the sin, what we would call dishonorable behavior.

Now, if there are pesticides, which are poisons, in my food, why would I eat that, if all things being equal, I had a choice? Now, there might be a percentage that could find it appealing and continue with the poisoned food, but that would only be a small percentage.

Surely it makes sense to eat things that come from the earth, and are grown with the minimum of human inputs? Though this might vary from place to place, and thus different solutions might be appropriate for different circumstances, I still don't understand how economically it is cheaper to sell processed food rather than unprocessed?

So this economic system obviously incentives the processing of food, and not the growing and distribution of unprocessed foodstuffs. I believe we have the capacity to change this, and we can only do it together, through an organised network of collaboraters.
