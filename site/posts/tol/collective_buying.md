## Buying Co-Op

For many years, ever since I was a young man, I could not understand why there was such a paucity of collectives that organised around the needs of local groups. I suppose, my current hypothesis, is that this is a threat to the dominance of the the elements of centralised power, which are seldom, if ever, about the needs of the people, but more concerned with maintained the status quo.

Is that not essentially what a corporation is? And is not a coorporation allowed complete self-rule - in other words, it can decide how to run itself. It could structured upon socialist or equal rights, perhaps a sharing internal economy, with autonomy and empowerement encourage at all levels. People refer to a Kibbutz structure as a socialist one, but could not a corporation be a socialist organisation?
