## Money

It is true that money and the need and greed for money is a huge motivating factor, and that is how our societies have been running for ages. We have all gladly or begrudgingly or by force participated in the creation of this form of society, with its benefits and lacks. However, at this point, the game has been so skewed to those that have money and resources, that for most others, it is useless even running â€“ almost like a lottery. There are many who believe in it, and many who put money and energy into it, but very few who reap the benefits amongst the millions who play. So it is with this present neo-liberal capitalism. Slowly more and more people will drop out of the running, until it will become an almost incestuous, but definitely nepotistic, game played amongst those wealthy enough to be able to participate in the game. The rest, it will be drudge, and labour and miserable conditions in which they will live.

The secret of this control is to ensure that those that do drop out do not have enough resources to be able to erect and maintain a different system, perhaps a different way of doing things. In the past, people opted out literally by simply packing and leaving. Up until recently there always seemed to be somewhere to be able to escape to. . . physically anyway.

Nowadays we have a different situation. The only space we have left in within the society that we live, and thus whatever arises will have to arise as a cancer or an illness to the body, and thus, hopefully the body society will arise changed by the experience, or otherwise, continue the same patterns, till the next attempt.
