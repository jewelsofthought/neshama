## Truth

Trust is based on truth. At first I wanted to refer to it as the "Web of Truth" - but then the criterion of judgement of the Truth or Falsity of a statement is a complex, especially if socio-economic and political dynamics are in play. However, as Truth engenders trust, and people have different standards of trust - depending on their environment and cultural makeup. One has to gain trust, but prove truth. Therefore, we wish to build a Web of Trust, but basing it on Truth.

## Trust

All organisations consist of a webs of trust that are interacting with other webs. These webs are made up of affinity groups. This affinity can be on many different levels. It could be financial, it could be familial, it could be philosophical, cultural, or religious.

Take your friends, for instance. The people you are close to, and whom you share parts of your life. They form an affinity group that you are part of. That group might be connected to another pod in a web that might consist of an organisation like a department in a university, or a project team that are part of a project that is occurring in a corporation, and so on outwards, further and further.
We are all connected via these strands that connect us all, making the tapestry of our lives and the human race itself.

If this is so, you might ask, then what is the element that we speak of that we would like to insert into this web within web that already exists? It is one of consciousness. Of becoming conscious of these interactions, and what is occurring.

There are many articles that have been written about these webs since the WWW arose. They explore this concept that all organisational structures, structures that manifest a certain coherency, and thus are all networks of some form. Webs are networks, trees are networks, blood vessels are networks, lungs are networks, even forests consist of webs of interactions.

## Sacred communities.

At the centre of the community, it core, so to speak will be a space, which is designated as the Temple, and it is dedicated to Truth. It also carries the creed of “peace before truth”. Speak only if necessary, maintaining essential silence. And if you speak, consider the effect of your words. But if you do speak, speak only the truth – or else pray instead for forgiveness and mercy.

That is the centre, the pillar around which all will stand.

In this sacred space, the deeper the truth spoken, the more we can know the person who speaks. In this way we create a communal space, within which to recognise the areas of positive resonance, and the work/service necessary to enable, support and encourage the manifestation of those areas in the lives of those affected.

## Complex systems

A characteristic of complex systems is that they are self-organising. Which means that each element, including the element that contains all (or part) of these elements, "self" regulates, or regulates itself.

{NOTE: This is a typical objectification, a separation. The same separation we make between us & G-d - as something that exists outside of myself - which makes me "self" sovereign {sovereign to myself, and no one else}. We then have the option to reject or accept that outside element. Instead, we are entangled, so much so, t hat it is often difficult to tell the two - what is truly me & what is G-d - apart.

The most important things to keep in mind are:

1. A perception of something is not the thing itself, but an "imaginary" or "made-up" version of the actual "thing".
2. There is not someone or something out there having an experience separate from your experience.. Although you could imagine such a thing, the only "experience" you can have of it, is your own "lived" - and therefore limited - experience of it.

## Web

1. Connected people, businesses and government
2. Allowed for speedier record keeping and data collection&mdash;especially social and financial data)
3. Allowed for mass surveillance
4. Allow the automation of human processes
5. Increased communication channels by and for humanity, which included the dark forces as well.

## Human $\Leftrightarrow$$ Interface

How human is the interface between the human and the AI/MI? This is not an AI problem, it is a human system interface (HIS - Human Interface to the System) problem.

Two levels:

1. Human level (anthropomorphic, narcissistic)
2. System level (objectification $$\Leftrightarrow$$ virtualisation)

Interface:

- where "consciousness", as a separate identity encounters the "non-conscious"

Empirical $$\Leftrightarrow$$ non-consciousness. It tracks dead (literally non-conscious) events. Based on data, i.e. measurement, recording, etc which is non-human.

## Ground state

This information is gathered for the living entity which has to maintain a certain stasis/ground state or stable state, which would make it's form recognisable/perceivable.

## Non-human consciousness (NHC)

NHC is apparent in all species, in fact, in the world around us. However, we have a form of NHC which we have created (also could be thought of as the narrative that we overlay over reality to calm our fears)

We are so eager to embrace NHC, but have yet to acknowledge the trove we are surrounded by.
