## Truth

Trust is based on truth. At first I wanted to refer to it as the "Web of Truth" - but then the criterion of judgement of the Truth or Falsity of a statement is complex, especially if socio-economic and political dynamics are in play. Truth engenders trust though people have different standards of trust, depending on their environment and cultural makeup. One has to gain trust, but prove truth. Therefore, we wish to build a Web of Trust basing it on Truth.

## Web

1. Connected people, businesses and government
2. Allowed for speedier record keeping and data collection&mdash;especially social and financial data.
3. Allows for mass surveillance
4. Allows the automation of human processes
5. Increased communication channels by and for humanity, which included the dark forces as well.

## Web structures

There are many articles that have been written about these webs since the WWW arose. They explore this concept that all organisational structures, structures that manifest a coherency, are all networks of some form. Webs are networks, trees are networks, blood vessels are networks, lungs are networks, even forests consist of webs of interactions.

## Stage V: Web of trust

As the network grows and needs blossom, a requirement for producers and consumers (roles in an economic model) will arise, for often the consumer and the producer are two aspects of the same person. This is where we create a web of trust. We already have a social web of trust, but this will be an object-orientated web of trust. Although this new web concerns objects, there are many aspects that will influence its life-cycle, and these will need to be trusted and monitored. The network will provide the necessary oversight so that consumers will know that the object is actually what it purports to be, and the claims it makes are true. At this stage, there are many regulations and regulatory bodies in the world in whom we no longer have confidence. By bringing a more personal aspect into the network and this web of trust, we will know, for instance, who is producing organic (non-pesticide) items and who is not. A set of regulations is not sufficient to ensure the integrity of the item. The network will take a more personal approach such as a visit by a member which is surely more valuable than a heap of regulations. All the relevant information will be available via the network.

This is about the consumer being able to trust the producer and supplier. If they subscribe to the same ethos, then the consumer will be less concerned. Checks can and should be done; however the abiding of regulations is onerous for the small scale, or neighbourhood, supplier. Through the personal connections that the network will encourage, these criteria could be assured in a far more pleasant and fruitful manner, while allowing for a more accurate assessment.

Blockchains can be used to enhance this web of trust.

## Web of Trust

All organisations consist of a webs of trust that are interacting with other webs. These webs are made up of affinity groups. This affinity can be on many different levels. It could be financial, it could be familial, it could be philosophical, cultural, or religious.

Take your friends, for instance. The people you are close to, and whom you share parts of your life. They form an affinity group that you are part of. That group might be connected to another pod in a web that might consist of an organisation like a department in a university, or a project team that are part of a project that is occurring in a corporation, and so on outwards, further and further.

We are all connected via these strands that connect us all, making the tapestry of our lives and the human race itself.

If this is so, you might ask, then what is the element that we speak of that we would like to insert into this web within web that already exists? It is one of consciousness and intention. Of becoming conscious of these interactions, and what is occurring, and using them to benefit all those who are members of our network.

There are many articles that have been written about these webs since the WWW arose. They explore this concept that all organisational structures, structures that manifest a certain coherency, and thus are all networks of some form. Webs are networks, trees are networks, blood vessels are networks, lungs are networks, even forests consist of webs of interactions.
