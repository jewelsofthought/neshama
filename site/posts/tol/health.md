If the body is robust and functioning properly, when it encounters and invasion (with evil intentions), it will successfully repel the invasion. If one has a positive and robust attitude to life, one is more likely to overcome the challenges and stresses that are encountered. If one is strong, and disciplined and clear in one's thoughts: Right thinking, then one is more likely to make the right decision. But, without faith, and belief in something, the person will have great difficulty mustering the steady will needed to overcome adversity.

However, if you faith has led you to believe in a Messiah who will descend from Heaven to save all our poor souls, you are seriously deluded, and we are doomed. Based on the principle of Original Sin, we are damned, and thus need a "Messiah" to "change our nature" - like the paschal lamb, **he** - never she, or G-d forbit, it - needs to be sacrificed in order to redeem us and make us good and whole again.

So, G-d, the Omnipotent Good, places evil in the world, and in man. Then sacrifices His only son to "redeem" or remove this evil that He has fashioned?
