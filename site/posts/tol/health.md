## Body is robust

If the body is robust and functioning properly, when it encounters and invasion (with evil intentions), it will successfully repel the invasion. If one has a positive and robust attitude to life, one is more likely to overcome the challenges and stresses that are encountered. If one is strong, and disciplined and clear in one's thoughts: Right thinking, then one is more likely to make the right decision. But, without faith, and belief in something, the person will have great difficulty mustering the steady will needed to overcome adversity.

However, if you faith has led you to believe in a Messiah who will descend from Heaven to save all our poor souls, you are seriously deluded, and we are doomed. Based on the principle of Original Sin, we are damned, and thus need a "Messiah" to "change our nature" - like the paschal lamb, **he** - never she, or G-d forbit, it - needs to be sacrificed in order to redeem us and make us good and whole again.

So, G-d, the Omnipotent Good, places evil in the world, and in man. Then sacrifices His only son to "redeem" or remove this evil that He has fashioned?

## Dependency

About the chemical dependency that is becoming endemic in this society, permeating every facet of it. Of the chemicals that are being foisted on us, in the name of progress and that are just a thinly veiled mechanism of control.

Once you introduce a dependency into the society, you can control the users.

Just say NO to drugs â€“ to all of them.

Only those who have reached a place where they feel boxed in, whether physically, emotionally, mentally or spiritually, finding themselves caught in some pattern that they cannot break out of, need entheogens to free them of that constraint and bring them closer to the realisation of G!d.
