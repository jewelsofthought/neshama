# The Movement

We call it a "movement", because of the language we are using, though it might be better and more simply expressed as the Move. Because, in actual fact, it is a movement - though it is not a horizontal movement, as moving from one home to another - but one could almost think of it as a vertical movement - though that too is not accurate. I would like to express it, and hope that it is, a dimensional move. In essence, it may be expressed as the movement into another dimension. Though that is not 100% accurate. It is the inclusion of the awareness of another dimension, and acknowledgement of those who are able to work with and in that dimension. Listen to them.

## Globalisation

The story opens with someone dying. It is the story of man’s paradoxes. We always march into the future, which is unstoppable. What is peculiarly human is the desire to stop along the way to enjoy the scenery. It is not so much where we are heading, but more in the way in which we travel.

There is a globalisation that is occurring. Humanity desires this. Our spirit wishes to be connected. Our spirit is what builds the connections. We wish to all belong to the same tribe – the human tribe, and all live in one global village, Earth. We all drink the same water and breathe the same air. So how can I say that this water is mine and I can do to it and use it in whichever way I please?

We say that water is public. Does that allow some to use and abuse it in whichever manner they choose? How can I spew toxins into the air, and say it is not affecting anyone? Air moves freely around the globe, as we now know.

If we all desire this globalisation, this unit, how can we live in a system that upholds private property rights, and allows for the ownership of resources? We have to declare certain resources like air, water and land unknowable--though we are so invested in land ownership, an almost sacrosanct edit – perhaps necessarily so.

But if we do not free all of these, we have to find some way to implement and acknowledge the responsibility that those who “own” these resources that affect us all, have.

We have to: 1. Stop all nuclear production immediately 2. Ban all new nuclear facilities, except those that are necessary for medical purposes. 3. Phase out all inessential military related production. Perhaps transform the military to service orientated activities. 4. Change compulsory military service into a national service orientated activity. 5. Phase out irradiation facilities. 6. Phase out nuclear, coal and oil based energy facilities, replacing them with distributed, local sustainable energy facilities. 7. Remove all non-essential chemical production, except for those that are essential to our survival. 8. Eat and produce only pesticide, chemical free foods that have not been genetically modified. 9. Support alternative and natural healing modalities and products.

We need to gather and come together to create this. We have to plan and co-ordinate this process, make careful decisions, create and implement solutions. We have to help and support one another to make this transition possible.

Enough of separate tribalism. We all know what we need to manifest. All these separate groups like Green Peace, Sierra Club, Earth First, etc. should focus on their area of expertise, and co-ordinate their efforts. We should not be supporting them as separate entities, but they need to combine their efforts so that they can be supported as one unit, having a single purpose.

We begin by building the support infrastructure upon which we can manifest this paradigm. And all these groups are essential in the creation of this model. We first and foremost need a communication and support network, a tree of life network that will connect all of us that believe and know that this current situation needs to change. This is how to link with one another – like holding hands to create a long chain of information and action – that will provide the unity and strength to change the current situation. Once we have that in place, we can start to organise and build this infrastructure so that we can ensure the future for our children.

{NOTE: This was written many years ago, and like all idealism, the reality of the dream is radically different, and becomes, in the hands of the human oligarchs, an evil and devious monster. If those who wish for power, whose greed knows no boundaries are the ones who implement such a global system, it will become a system of control and authorotarian dictatorship, and dystopian nightmare. How can those who are disempowered, and believe that they are slaves, ever become masters of their own fates, let alone the fate of the world?}

_So we have the “great reset”, agenda 2030, in which their will be a one-world government run by the global corporations carrying forth decisions that are shaped by an almost unknown, unelected global elite, whose first priority will be to ensure the continuation of their privilege and their power._

There has also arisen another horseman of the Armageddon, and that is the bio-weapons. Once unleashed upon humanity, these man-made virii and amended bacteria will pursue their own agendas, and will be impossible to eradicate or remove.

### Types

There are 2 types of people who joined the movement.

1. _Those who were playing out their childhood traumas_ - as this space allowed for a wider playing field in which to express these traumas.

   This is a natural result of a society becoming more successful and thus more affluent. It allows the inheritors of this affluence a greater sphere of activity, and thus inevitably foster expressions that are challenging to the fabric of the society, and eventually the very fundamental principles upon which it is based.

2. _Those who wished to build a society based on a different, a new narrative_. It was if they had heard something, and were awakened to a vision.

   None were sure what it was - they just new what it "felt" like, or what they dreamed it could feel like. Many of them went in search of this "feeling". Some went to the plants to see if they could teach them, some went to the sacred texts and sought answers, some joined cults religious, or otherwise, believing that community was the solution - but it is also the problem. Many believed that the Mother, the earth that nourishes us all, would have the answer - but against the deadly onslaught on everything living that is we are a part of, it is unlikely that there will be any earth left to teach us. We will have turned all the forests into commercial plots by then.

   We sat in circles and talked about the vision of the New Earth, and we tried to build communities based on these New Principles, but we inevitably fell back into the patterns we were familiar with, and in all these efforts we saw the same dynamics play itself out - and these were the same dynamics that happened in all groups, whether religious or not, commercial or social.

   **The Game has to change**. With the same volcanic effect that the theories of quantum dynamics had on classical physics. [Perhaps the very term Quantum Physics is an anachronism, like Real TV. Perhaps this "Quantum Physics" is not physics at all, as everything it talks about is non-physical actually. Yet it does a good job of "proving" its reality. In the same way, if the Shaman could produce results that could be empirically measured (according to the accepted, standard measurements - those measurements that are acceptable to the accepted rules of measurement. This is the same as the impact of a new legal system on indigenous people - which needs always to be backed up by military power) who now have to accept new measurements of social behaviour imposed by the ruling class (which is what actually makes them the "ruling class" - not any inherent human characteristics. Which is why we have more popular respect for the successful entrepreneur, rather than the privileged noblesse. We look at them with the fascinated stare of the mouse watching the snake as it slithers towards it, hoping that it will strike the mouse frozen beside it. We know that these people have the ability to destroy our lives in a moment if they so wish. We fight to hold back their desire to control everyone and everything. But we must remember that they are just scared of the Divine nature of the universe and themselves - which is the last thing they will be able to acknowledge, having spent their entire existence catering to the empirical (measurable according to standard accepted measurements) human nature of their being. And this is an attempt to build walls around the terror of extinction, of not being anymore, forgotten in the ashes of time. So they need to build huge edifices to their greatness, pyramid and towers. They have to fight great wars and accomplish grandiouse (and often idiotic) things - to impress everyone, and everyone can applaud their greatness.

   But I ask you O great ones who rule over us and wish to control us like ants, like little slaves to do their bidding, and feed their petty, mostly material, desires with our juices - how large is your pyramid next to the giant nebula that gaze upon us in pity? If you are remembered for a 1000 years, O my Emperor, how long is that in the eyes of our very planet, which your science says has been here for 15,000,000,000 years? Well, I say, however, or whatever built this planet, is going to be remembered for far longer than any one of you will be. And is capable of producing things far greater than any of you, or your wizards, whether of science or magic, could ever hope to imagine.

**The beauty of this strange Viral time is that it is clearly showing the difference between these two.**
