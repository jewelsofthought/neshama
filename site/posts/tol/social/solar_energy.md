[Solar Energy:](https://greenenergysolutions.co.za/)

- A rapid return on investment
  The return on investment will and can only be in energy, once there is no grid.

- Reliable source of energy
  The source of energy, the sun, is fairly reliable. The electronics and storage is not as reliable. The batteries will last 10 years maximum. Electronics are prone to all sorts of failures and other unpredictable events, especially out in the field.
- Low to no maintenance
  When it works. But pricey to fix when it doesn't.
- Insurance against rising prices
  This is blatantly in relation to an existing grid. Nor is there any mention of the probability of the prices of the various components needed to keep the system going for 20 years rising.
- An inexhaustible supply of energy from the sun
  Correct. But the current system that we are using to "harness" this energy is both costly, complex and not inexhaustible.
- Independence from national electricity grids
  Especially when it collapses and is not longer functioning. That is true freedom. Like the way to free onself of police is to cause the police force to collapse - not to free oneself of criminals.
- Reduces your carbon footprint.
  Reduces, but does not remove. I would like to see the comparison of energy to extract, transport, process - not looking at the economics of retrenching and retraining, of destroying industries and nourishing new ones, etc, etc - manufacture, install and maintain an energy grid that runs on the sun. I believe it will end up being nuclear that will then step into the gap - also in support of the now almost holy cause of reducing our carbon footprint.
- Expected lifetime use of 20-25 years.
  Well, I've kinda covered this, but I will ask it this way. What, besides the panels will last for 20-25 years? Is there any sort of guarantee, that the system will last for 20 years? Or will the insurance companies step into the gap?

"If you are lucky, the system may last for 20-25years, but real data show that this is only the case in a very small sample. So, we offer, for a minimal additional fee, a full-coverage 15 year insurance."

Have we not heard that one before?
