The only way to have some control over the information is to have a private network. This means that the network is separated into an So one will have an inner private one, and an outer, globally interfacing one. Not only is all information in the inner network private to the members of that network, of course, but also that all traffic is routed through the network in a way that is untraceable. Thus, not only is the information private, but so are the transport channels that it uses. The outer part of the network is one that relies on and interfaces with the global internet.

However, if that network is impenetrable, then the participants of that network set themselves up as a target, an "other". The general mind will become suspicious of the secrets you might be keeping, and you might be labelled as "undesirables" at best, or criminals, at worst. If you hang out there, it will be assumed that you are of a similar ilk, just by association, and will come under suspicion. Thus, immediately, anyone who steps into the shadows of the dark web, with a VPN and Tor browser, will be tagged (and probably geolocated).

Therefore, the best disguise is the "no-disguise" disguise. For instance, use innocuous phrases for saying things. It is extremely difficult for the computer to determine whether you are speaking nonsense &mdash; even though you might be using correct phrases &mdash; or not. Whereas it is easy for it to recognise encrypted messages and very easy to track trigger words.
