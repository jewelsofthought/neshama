Is it just me? Am I the only one that sees the absurdity of the situation? Why are we all still enthralled by the ongoing performance? It is like a bad series, full of catastrophes and struggles, some real, most made up, that goes on and on in a never ending repetition of mistakes, lies, deception, illusion, and acting parts on the real stage of life.

Am I the only one that thinks that cities are, for the most part, inhuman, dirty, and ugly? Is that the best we can do? And the it is the same story wherever we look. We are destroying ourselves in our quest for... what exactly?

Really, people! Is it not time to change this? To create a living, social environment that does not consist of such rabid inequality. That the ravages of the extreme polarisation imposed upon us all, the lack of peace, the oppression of certain peoples, the crushing burden of impoverishment.

When will we wake up and no longer be entranced by this constant refrain of it will be better if... we get rid of, we take, we conquer, we bully, we oppress, we ignore, we behave cruelly. But, as it says, as you reap, so shall you sow.

This situation of constant conflict and manoeuvring can only continue to exist if those in power wish it to be so – and if they wish it so – there must be a reason. It must be because they have another agenda, one which benefits them the most. For if that is not the case, then those that we put in power, or that apparently have the power – don't! In other words, they are just the public faces of those who are really in power – whoever, or whatever, they might be.

To my point, those in power must want the situation to continue in a similar vein for two reasons. One is that they benefit from it, and the corollary to that, is that one would not want to change the system in which one has garnered power – and in exact/linear relationship to the power gained, the so-called, law of inertia. The more power, the more desperately you would hold on to it. "The higher you rise, the lower you can fall".
