## Power

> Where power goes, governance must follow.

Power is upheld by a belief in the system which grants certain people authority and power&mdash;bolstered by a (misplaced) faith in a human created system, rather than relying on and learning from the Divinely created system.

There is also the unfortunate and very real threat of those in power taking (by whatever means possible) ever greater power, until they reach they ultimate reach the peak of absolute power&mdash;or die trying.

No human system is [perfect](incompleteness.html){Godel}. Even if the system in which this human system is embedded&mdash;call it the "universe"&mdash;is perfect and balanced. How would we, contained in the embedded system ever be able to say anything about the universe in which we are enclosed &mdash; let alone whether it is "perfect" and "balanced" or not?

However that may be, it is certain that whatever system we create, nay even imagine, is, and can only be, an approximation, a facsimile of the encompassing universe.

Therefore, this power is claimed, by force or by fancy, and upheld through a social doctrine that has enough proponents to uphold and serve it. The supporters of the system are clustered around those zealouts who have succeeded by and through this social doctrine, all of whom, by propagating and upholding said system have benefitted from it in some way.

The bulk of those proponents will perhaps comprise those who accept it, because believing in it is easier than going against the current narrative... "Just going with the flow".

Combined with the techniques of branding, backed by careful data analysis, this could result in a serious abuse of power, having global repercussions.
