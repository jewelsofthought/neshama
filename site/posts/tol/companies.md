As companies become successful they will begin to collude with one another to control whatever area of resources they need. The structural dynamics of these systems reward psychopathic behaviour. Somehow, somewhere, in our psyche, we support this type of behaviour, which other places us in psychotic states, and/or is a reflection of our deep psychosis. It is like being born into a ghetto, or prison that is populated with lunatics. That is why people are forever trying to escape through whatever means they can.

Unless the urge called "impulse from below" arises, as a dream, a desire for something else, that becomes the sole purpose of existence.

## Fines

Companies are fined &ndash; where does the money go? To the families whose lives were impacted by the actions of these companies? Even so, in the end, no one, no person (or persons) is held liable. A company has no purpose, no meaning, unless people are involved. Even shell companies have a purpose, even though it might be for the financial protection of a person (or persons).

Which brings about an interesting question of whether it is still a company if it was run purely by AI. Could an AI possibly apply for ownership of a company? A company whose sole purpose is to further AI itself?

If a company does something bad, it is like blaming the knife used to stab someone. Then we punish the knife for what it did&mdash;as if it had a will of its own. Similarly, we treat the companies upon breaking the law. We treat it as if it had a will of its own, devoid of human influence. But just as a knife cannot jump off a table and kill someone, so a company cannot just poisen people, or create addicts "spontaneously". There will always be a human influence driving it.

Unless you wish to argue that it is the "nature" of the companies to behave this way. In the same way we might argue that someone misbehaved because of childhood trauma.

But that is not a valid argument. For we have created this entity with enormous power that has no control over the beastly aspect of its human "masters".

> "We are born beasts, and our journey is to discover our human side.

That request the practice of constraining our beastly nature. Not destroying or imprisoning it, but of learning to "ride" it, like a stallion or a wave&mdash;both themselves forces of nature.

Yes, our being is made up essentially of three plus two points. But too often the Divine is invoked before the beast has been subdued, and is used to justify the most beastly behaviour, because the human side is not yet developed enough to walk with the spirit world.

The very reason why novices are introduced to a disciplined practice to teach them the necessary restraint to discern what is human and what is beast. For only then will you be able to travel in the spirit world, never doubting the Divine Will. For this work can only be done in with the Grace of the Divine.

You might have missiles and guns, power, money and control of all our resources, while my only weapon is truth.

The lie perpetuated behind all these weapons is that is to protect us, the people&mdash;while the truth is that they are there to protect you, the very ones who control the weapons.

A society that values something that it is supposed to represent, yet itself has no intrinsic value, brings us to a place where a valueless item&mdash;an item that in itself has no intrinsic value&mdash;begins to represent value. It is an expression of the empty values that have become endemic in our society.

We have reached the absurd stage in which the item has itself become virtual, and more of it exists in a virtual form than in any tangible state.

Be that as it may, in addition, the point is that if money is being used to express the value of interactions between people, it will, by its very nature, have an influence on the "value" of any transaction. It is upon these local interactions upon which the health of any society is exists.
