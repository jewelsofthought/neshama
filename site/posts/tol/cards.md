## Specialisation

Specialisation produces a web of Inter-dependencies

## Systems (old)

All dynamic/moving systems are alive. If a system never changes, then it is dead. If a food can stand open for a long time, then it is dead. All static, absolute, unmoving systems are dead. Thus sterilized systems or pasteurised food stuffs are often life depleting. Though there is must support and nourishment that a dead tree or animal provides the living creature of the forest.

## Sovereignty ~ empowerment

> There is no real sovereignty. The only real sovereign is G-d. The only earthly sovereignty we experience, is as power over. What we can seek only in the societal environment, is "empowerment".## Law

> Because there is no law forbidding something, does not mean it is acceptable to do it.

## Bridging

If an addict wishes to change and escape the chains of his addiction, he needs a safe alternative, before he crashes. If there is a bridge available that provided a way out of his present situation, and into something safe, many would choose the this option - especially in the current global crisis.

### Between two worlds

Just as the healer tries to guide the addict out of his darkness into another world, a world that is filled with more light for him especially. Similarly, the mystic tries to lead people, who are unhappy and unfulfilled, to a path that will increase their joy and light.

## Power & Governance

> Where power goes, governance must follow.

## Governance in the global space.

The challenge is to bring governance into the global space.

Humanity is rediscovering its commons: the self-organized management of resources which people need for their survival and livelihood. The ethic of commoning is based on the recognition that a person has the right to a means of sustenance without interference or harm from others. In this sense, the commons are an inclusive expression of the right to life and the right to justice.

Our greatest challenge is not the risk of environmental collapse, resource wars, scarcity diaspora's, oppressive rulers or rancorous disputes over why future generations are denied the opportunity to live in a peaceful and equitable society. Our true task is the creation of inclusionary institutions for sustainable resource production and provisioning as the climate crisis bears down upon the world.

## 666m (cov-19)

But the descent from 7B to 666m will be catastrophic and will be a stranger to any who dreamt of a world with only 666m people inhabiting it.

## Fish

Like a school of fish, all travelling in the same direction. But what position any particular fish takes, or when or why is unclear.

- Highly complex and time consuming to reconstruct.
- Use "wave dynamics to cause it to flow over like a wave
  - Amplitude, speed, frequencey, phase angle...
- How many variables?
  - Indexer does not have to calculate.
  - It just keeps the waves flowing
- Source
  - When the wave leaves its source, each element reacts according to its state.
  - The next one will know it and reject and begin reset.
  - Traverses as far as it needs
    or exits with error.

I have been trying to build the tree from the top down, starting at the root and spreading out from there. The actual way that it needs to be expressed is each individual as a seed, that grows into a tree, that becomes a forest... connecting to all the other "forests" out there.

The health of any forest is determined both by the health of its trees, that is the health of its members, and the environment in which they grow. As well as the environment around the forest, with the climate, the rain, and the other factors that sustain a healthy forest.

It is said that in healthy forest ecosystems, they will communicate events between one another... and the receiver will begin to react to this information.

In human terms, the individual is the seed, he (hopefully) grows into a healthy adult, who becomes a productive member of his community, which (hopefully) co-exists in a symbiotic manner with the communities around.

## Great Pirates

Bucky F. talked about the Great Pirates of yore. I think these pirates have reached a new level. It has become simply a protection racket. When in a land of gangsterism, the only choice a normal person has is to choose - is which gang to become part of.

Gangs seem to be the natural form of authority that arises when there is no other.

However, there is a newer, more conscious version of this that is arising, albeit rough and still in its infancy. We refer to it as social networks - also referred to as networks of affinity. Where people of like minds share and collaborate.

That is, if he is lucky enough to have a choice, which is actually why we refer to them as gangs - as they generally do not give one a choice - and use whatever means necessary, even killing, to achieve their goals. So what choice do you really have?

And why are many aspects of the legal version of this any different? Especially for those of us who have had the experience of an army - whether as a soldier or a civilian.

## Information scarcity

What I have noticed in the last years, is that the information freely available is becoming scarcer. This was not done by privatising the internet, by rather by privatising the information available on the public net. Once again, producing control of the information by the elite. But it did not end there. Then began the campaign to discredit the public source of information. This was done by polluting the information that was flowing along the public channel.

An unintended effect of this, or perhaps it is an intended one, is that idiotic news appeals to idiots, and this generally starts a popular movement - any meme to express the outrage and frustration endemic amongst the oppressed underclass. Remember, the underclass does not necessarily have to oppressed. In fact, they are often the unsung heroes of many a triumph, with their quiet solitude and desire to just have a peaceful and happy life - not striving as those who already have too much seem to be constantly doing.

## 3d Tree of Life

Beginning of a 3d design for the Tree of Life:
