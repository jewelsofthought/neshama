# The Movement

We call it a "movement", because of the language we are using, though it might be better and more simply expressed as the Move. Because, in actual fact, it is a movement - though it is not a horizontal movement, as moving from one home to another - but one could almost think of it as a vertical movement - though that too is not accurate. I would like to express it, and hope that it is, a dimensional move. In essence, it may be expressed as the movement into another dimension. Though that is not 100% accurate. It is the inclusion of the awareness of another dimension, and acknowledgement of those who are able to work with and in that dimension. Listen to them.

### Types

There are 2 types of people who joined the movement.

1. _Those who were playing out their childhood traumas_ - as this space allowed for a wider playing field in which to express these traumas.

   This is a natural result of a society becoming more successful and thus more affluent. It allows the inheritors of this affluence a greater sphere of activity, and thus inevitably foster expressions that are challenging to the fabric of the society, and eventually the very fundamental principles upon which it is based.

2. _Those who wished to build a society based on a different, a new narrative_. It was if they had heard something, and were awakened to a vision.

   None were sure what it was - they just new what it "felt" like, or what they dreamed it could feel like. Many of them went in search of this "feeling". Some went to the plants to see if they could teach them, some went to the sacred texts and sought answers, some joined cults religious, or otherwise, believing that community was the solution - but it is also the problem. Many believed that the Mother, the earth that nourishes us all, would have the answer - but against the deadly onslaught on everything living that is we are a part of, it is unlikely that there will be any earth left to teach us. We will have turned all the forests into commercial plots by then.

   We sat in circles and talked about the vision of the New Earth, and we tried to build communities based on these New Principles, but we inevitably fell back into the patterns we were familiar with, and in all these efforts we saw the same dynamics play itself out - and these were the same dynamics that happened in all groups, whether religious or not, commercial or social.

   **The Game has to change**. With the same volcanic effect that the theories of quantum dynamics had on classical physics. [Perhaps the very term Quantum Physics is an anachronism, like Real TV. Perhaps this "Quantum Physics" is not physics at all, as everything it talks about is non-physical actually. Yet it does a good job of "proving" its reality. In the same way, if the Shaman could produce results that could be emperically measured (according to the accepted, standard measurments - those measurements that are acceptable to the accepted rules of measurement. This is the same as the impact of a new legal system on indigenous people - which needs always to be backed up by military power) who now have to accept new measurements of social behaviour imposed by the ruling class (which is what actually makes them the "ruling class" - not any inherint human characteristics. Which is why we have more popular respect for the successful entrepeneur, rather than the privileged noblesse. We look at them with the fascinated stare of the mouse watching the snake as it slithers towards it, hoping that it will strike the mouse frozen beside it. We know that these people have the ability to destroy our lives in a moment if they so wish. We fight to hold back their desire to control everyone and everything. But we must remember that they are just scared of the Divine nature of the universe and themselves - which is the last thing they will be able to acknowledge, having spent their entire existence catering to the emperical (measurable according to standard accepted measurements) human nature of their being. And this is an attempt to build walls around the terror of extinction, of not being anymore, forgotten in the ashes of time. So they need to build huge edifices to their greatness, pyramid and towers. They have to fight great wars and accomplish grandiouse (and often idiotic) things - to impress everyone, and everyone can applaud their greatness.

   But I ask you O great ones who rule over us and wish to control us like ants, like little slaves to do their bidding, and feed their petty, mostly material, desires with our juices - how large is your pyramid next to the giant nebula that gaze upon us in pity? If you are remembered for a 1000 years, O my Emperor, how long is that in the eyes of our very planet, which your science says has been here for 15,000,000,000 years? Well, I say, however, or whatever built this planet, is going to be remembered for far longer than any one of you will be. And is capable of producing things far greater than any of you, or your wizards, whether of science or magic, could ever hope to imagine.

**The beauty of this strange Viral time is that it is clearly showing the difference between these two.**
