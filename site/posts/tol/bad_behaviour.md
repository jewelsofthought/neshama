## Dealing with aberrant nations

Remove the evil nations from your midst.
Unfortunately, that includes the innocents.

Would China be included? Or Russia? They are not waging aggressive wars in the regions. They might be intent on expanding their influence & control - but they are not doing in military and with blatent aggression - like the US is, and has been doing. It, unfortunately, might qualify as being evil. However, these three are too big to fail - and thus, even if one of your pillars start to fail, you will have to upgrade it, fix it, else the building will fall.

## [Sword of Damocles](https://www.history.com/news/what-was-the-sword-of-damocles)

“Every man, woman and child's lives hang by the slenderest of threads, under a viral sword of Damocles, capable of being rent at any moment by miscalculation or by madness.”

The only way to straighten this mess out it with the Sword of Truth that will cut through this Gordian knot of truth and lies, greed and deception, heroism and shameless behaviour.

It is for each one of us to take an Vow of Truth.
