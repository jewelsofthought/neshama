## Moneyless Communities

In order for this new paradigm to emerge, we need to create and support communities whose transactions are not money based, especially not based on a fiat system and/or a credit/debt economy. From its inception, these communities will aim to provide all the basic necessities of life to all members of the community, as well as to any member that visits the community – within reason. Those that reside on this community will labour to maintain and support the community, but no transactions inside the community will be based on money, and all internal decisions as to the disbursement of resources will be based on communal need and for the benefit of the community, and thus the individuals who comprise this community.

There are many such communities already in existence, as well as many who would like to take this step and live within a community that supports them. The jump to the next step, that of a functioning web of communities, dedicated to living a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle, in active support and communication with one another could be fairly swift.

With $1m, we should be able to set up a community consisting of 20 people, 10 of whom will focus on supporting the land and its system and needs, 10 of whom will work on the network.

This can be done in a country like South Africa, where the amount needed by the participants is around $1000/mth. The purchase of a piece of land, either with the necessary infrastructure and systems in place, or to upgrade/install them, would take around $500k. At $240k per year support for the 20 members, we will have about 2 – 3 years of money-freedom within the community.

If we assume that the community will begin to be productive within 1 year, then that amount will be reduced, with the goal of being financially self-sufficient by the 3rd year. With the support of the emerging Tree of Life, this should be attainable, as the idea will be able for the Network to be providing most of the community’s needs.
I predict that if we have 10 people working on the network, that we will soon have at least 100 communities participating. If there is sufficient support from the greater network, so that we can receive funding we could have a network of these 100 communities, having become self-sufficient within a reasonable timeframe.

In this period of transition, there will be those who cannot join a community because of other commitments/reasons, yet are in agreement with the goals of the network. They participate by providing energy or funds or products/items that are needed by the community.

If they are willing to give a tithe to the network, either in money or in energy, these communities will, no doubt, be well supported.

These communities are only moneyless within the community. Because they will be arising in the current system, they will still need to relate to the surrounding world in which money is a determining factor. One could say that internally the communities are moneyless, but externally they will still be bound by money.

Drawing from all the cultural creatives - those who are aligned with the goals and dreams of this network - who number in the millions, we anticipate a large number will see the benefits of the network and will join and support these efforts.

There are a number of avenues of finance:

**1. Sponsorship**

The Global Challenge has inspired me to seek funding for the project--which has lain dormant on this issue for many years. A $1 million grant from an organisation such as this would be sufficient to seed the project. So, whether it is via this Challenge, or through some other foundation; whether through crowdsourcing or through angel funding; I believe the money is available.

This $1m will enable the project to purchase and fund for about 3 years a seed community. It will be money-less. It will require anyone wishing to join to give 10% of their total assets or equivalent to the community. The members be provided food, shelter, clothing and tools.

It will require the participation of 20 people. At least 10 will maintain the community, while 10 will work on creating the network.

The process of creation is three pronged.

    (i) One direction is to collect and collate all the cultural creatives.

This includes approaching all the groups and societies where they tend to gather, like Sierra Club, Green Peace, Amnesty International, etc., and seeing if there is a possibility of including mass membership. The requirement will be for them to organise their membership in the same network formation as would enable them to participate in the ToLnet].

Once these individuals have been organised into clusters and are familiar with the protocols and functioning of the ToLNet, having pledged support, either financially, or in barter either of some other needed product or item, or time and energy, to the tune of 10%/mth. which should be between $1 - $100. Anyone who wishes to add more would be welcome to. This is because a certain amount of their energy is still being used in earning money for their upkeep.
ToLNet would be a non-profit cooperative, though it would have a portion that would be not-for profit – called perhaps GreenWay.

    (ii) Another is the creation and sustaining of conscious communities.

And the mapping of a tree of action of these communities in order to facilitate interaction and support, both in resources, educational and material, as well as to become suppliers to the greater network. There are many such fledgling communities already in existence, and many more would arise given the financial resources. Most of them would gladly join up to a network of support such as ToLNet would be offering. If they show greater success in managing their resources and finances, as they would if they joined the network, it would attract more membership.
Once there is a global network of such communities, and someone was on one community, and wished for a change, he could then go and spend time on another community in the same moneyless condition. All that would be required of him or her is to find the transport money. They could hitch and hope, or perhaps, if available, obtain the money from the community itself. There are also ways of earning it. If the network is truly successful, then perhaps that problem of transport between the various communities would be handled more efficiently.

    (iii) Urban Communities

The last is to encourage and facilitate the creation of urban communities. This would be more complex, consisting of affinity circles emerging from the ToL network itself. The reason for the “original”, which I also term “geographical” or “physical” affinity group, is to enable the communication and decision making aspect of the network to function effectively. However, just as in on the computer, once the internet is functioning, we can create our web of interactions. Thus markets can arise and feed one another, business based on others. It is like the android system on your phone, on which people have been provided the freedom to write apps to help themselves and others solve a problem that bothers them. It will be the same in a true free-market system, one that is controlled by huge interests – whose goal is not to make as much money or control as many resources as possible – but who represent the collective interests of the greater society.

**2. Membership**

Once the person has become a full member of the community, some percentage of his earnings that stem from the community itself will return to the community. If the portion that is returned to the community is less than the stipulated amount, then a certain amount will be extracted for “services” rendered by the community.
If someone or some concern has just an associate membership with the network but uses it for marketing and for earning of a private profit, then % of that profit will be granted to the network itself.

For example, say the network sources organic oats from a number of organic farms. It provides these oats to the communities at cost, plus expenses, any profit of which goes back into the network. If there is excess, it will then sell it to the general public at a fair profit, again, all the profit being funnelled back into the network.
No one may sell on the network without adhering to the principles ensconced in the charter dealing with transactions. If a business is granted associate status – which means that it abides by the ToL business charter – it will provide the agreed upon percentage of its transactional earnings to the network itself. If the source of the product is the network itself, all the earnings will go to the network.

**3. Affiliates**

Then there are those who cannot commit to this lifestyle but wish to support it, until they can become full members. They will actively or passively support it, paying their dues, some even providing energy, and other support to the network.

Thus, in brief, there are three levels of connection to the network (or four, if we include disconnected).
The first is to be full member, and thus having joined a community, in whatever form that has taken, and become a full-time member of the community – which means that your daily bread is provided by the community and you have changed your lifestyle to live in the constraints and freedom of one of the network communities that has arisen.
The second is to be a supporting member. This is someone who is not ready to make the full commitment to the network, but believes in its mission and wants to support it. Thus he joins, and pays his dues. Thus he becomes an active member of the community, though not benefitting from its full support. He can even participate in the decisions and other issues, though as a supporting member.

The third is someone who is only wishing to do business or receive some service, education or service that the network offers. This person can join as an associate member, and then has access to a limited amount of the benefits of the network. His participation would be on a voluntary basis. But there would be some benefits, or being a preferred trading partner, etc. The requirement would be for him to be connected to the tree, and to adhere to the basic charter of the network in all his dealings with it.

There is a possibility that a group or organisation would like to interact with the network. This is also an associate membership. However, the group would need to be organised as a tree connected to the Tree of Life, so that the various communication protocols between the people could be upheld.
For those who are not connected to the network, disjoint, the interaction would be the same as it is presently, with any business partner.

## Self-sufficiency

The ultimate goal would be to make the whole network self-sufficient. That is that it can provide itself all the items needed for its existence. The water, food, shelter, energy and resources to maintain each and every one of its communities – without the need for money.

Remember, that though within the community there is no need for money, being embedded in a capitalist economy requires the community to interface with the economic realities of the surrounding environment. If there is a market that is created for the goods that are available within the community, then it will encourage the manufacture of that product.

In the spirit of all transactions being open, the network can know what it costs to produce the article, and thus what it is truly worth, and can give input into improving it.

## Trading

If there is excess, it will be sold to the general population (non-ToLNet persons) at a fair profit. The profit of which will be funnelled back into the community. The reason that the money earned needs to return to the community, is to prevent someone from having made much money and thus building a very fancy house, bringing in labour and resources from outside the community, and, in addition, if it was next to another who is struggling to make economic headway, or uninterested, it would then produce a similar situation as to that in the world today.

This might not be the only way to reduce this impact, and if there are others, a community is very welcome to experiment.

There are many articles that have been written about these webs since the WWW arose. They explore this concept that all organisational structures, structures that manifest a coherency, and thus are all networks of some form. Webs are networks, trees are networks, blood vessels are networks, lungs are networks, even forests consist of webs of interactions.
