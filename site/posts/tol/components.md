## Reason for network

- connect to support and nourish life.
- accepting that we live in a web of life, in which all parts are important, we need to find more inclusive ways of living.
- this does not just include humans, but all the animals and species that share our lives on this planet.

## Network

- Private
- Multi-layered
- Distributed

Rather than speak of the connectivity between us with the diagram of a tree, which is a construct that is useful to computers, let us envisage the construct as circles.

- Circles within circles (rather than tree like structure)
- Tree structure is useful for computer

## Blockchain

- Accountability
- Governance
- Regulatory
- Record

## Local currency/tokens

- energy tokens
  - work done/action
  - potential energy

## Message Brokers

- fail safe
- log everything (blockchain)
- everything (mostly) as a message
- leverage existing technology
  - severless
  - responsive

## Organic

- spread only by word-of-mouth
- hand out cards, with code
  - needs to be activated.
  - i notify i have handed out card (activate)

## Verification

- Public Key Rings
- First Verified by other members who have met the person, and know who he/she is.

## Human centric IT

- Use computer communication protocols and algorithms to connect and facilitate communication between people
- Computers focus upon connecting computers. Can leverage much of what we have learnt from computers to connect people.
- End points of connectivity, important points should be the people, not the machines.
