## MultiScale Networks

> Date: 1st Sep, 2020

_MultiScale Networks for Global Environmental Governance_ by Paul Hertzog - 2004.

The path to a better solution to the present systemic breakdown in our global societies is no doubt a multi-scale network, a network that is rooted locally, in the individual/family unit, but is globally connected.

This is an attempt to use a multi-scale network to enable diverse elements with often conflicting agendas to find a place where they can find an optimal solution.

MS: Here we have again the principle of loosely-coupled objects passing asynchronous messages. Here it is not even sure that it will be received. But if it is...

My issue with this is not with the technology (multi-scale network) that is used, but the purpose, or ultimate outcome is to come to a compromise to a situation that is already dire, has needed to be attended to for years, and has not for the same reasons that require a multi-scale network to find a compromise. But where bare necessities are threatened, there should be no compromise.

As society becomes wealthier, it relies on more and more distant sources for its very necessities, until these become the "essentials" of the society. We need money to have food, shelter, clothing, etc. We need electricity to live. We need petrol to harvest our food. So it is no longer the food we are concerned about, but the electricity that we need to live. To obtain or store the very food that we actually need to live.

Thus our energy becomes used to things that are not sustaining our physical existence, but merely some abstract narrative/idea/ ideology that is being used to keep us enslaved.

Thus a whole different perspective has to be cultivated before anything will change. Otherwise all we are doing is breaking out a small piece of the monolith of control.
