Rather than speak of the connectivity between us with the diagram of a tree, which is a construct that is useful to computers, let us envisage the construct as circles.

1. Circles within circles (rather than tree like structure)
2. Tree useful for computer
3. Idea of using computer communication protocols and algorithms to connect and facilitate communication between people
4. Computers focus upon connecting computers. Can leverage much of what we have learnt from computers to connect people.
5. End points of connectivity, important points should be the people, not the machines.
6. Reason to connect is to support and nourish life.
7. Accepting that we live in a web of life, in which all parts are important, we need to find more inclusive ways of living.
8. This does not just include humans, but all the animals and species that share our lives on this planet.
