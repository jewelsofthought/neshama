We have not anthropomorphised G-d, but have divined certain human qualities by making making these human characteristics divine, those that benefit the rulers of the time. Especially the more beastly and violent of these tendencies, we justify in the name of our "evil" inclination &mdash; for by making them divine, we accept them in our human lords and kings.

- Earth project
- must be biped!
- no tri-or-above-ped can attain human consciousness for it has already a consciousness far more connected and in the ocean of reality/consciousness than we are able to.

Agree on method but disagree on teaching!
Already set in place: lord and servant (Enlil)
Enki preferred teach and pupil - seeds wisdom teachers

Sexual differentiation:
meeting occurs in 4th dimension
just as (you are) the brane that defines a top.
shape is 1d < than the total object itself,
so is the skin (_parkod_, veil) that surrounds us. Filtering and protecting us, is 1d < than our inner space. What we refer to as our soul!
Thus we have 2 parts to our being. The inner space and the veil or shape that "defines" it i.e., gives it shape.

We are aware of them both. They are inseparable - like the two sides of a coin, just as is a $$ \triangle $$. For with the skin that "defines" its shape, it would not be able to be distinguished from the background. Just as there might be an infinite amount (or uncountable) amount of shapes on this page, but we can see only a tiny selection of them.

> Every shape has a skin (or brane) that is the -1 dimensional representation.

Consider, for a moment, that conscious beings that manifest in 4d are actually a 5d consciousness. Even such 5d beings will have binary contexts&mdash;one of which we call sexual&mdash;for all higher dimensional beings will express themselves in some form or fashion in all lower dimensions. Thus, if we were 11d beings, we would appear in some shape or form on every dimension below 11d, some of which would be more conscious, and some of which would be less &mdash; or what we would consider as subconscious.

Could we then just be 4d beings manifesting in 3d. That is to say that there is a "Julian" existing in 4d&mdash;the 4d manifestation of the 3d Julian.
