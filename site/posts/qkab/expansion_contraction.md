## Expansion

Let us assume the universe is going through a process of expansion and contraction, a cycle of birth and death, something like the Inflation Theory of the Universe.

Focussing on the expansion, the birth of this universe, it is believed that it started off from a single point, the "Big Bang", as it is called. There is a more expansive version of this idea that speaks of many, possibly simultaneous, points of emergence. And that brings in the possibility of multiple, possible infinite, points of emergence and contraction, birth and death.

> There are two ways to encounter another dimension. One is through expansion from a single point&mdash;from 1 to $$\infty$$ and the other is dissolution from the single point to nothing, from 1 to true zero, or nothingness.

## Perfection

Total balance, perfection...
Nothing happening, like a pendulum,
still and unmoving, all is at rest.

We say the pendulum is balanced when it is in a state of zero (0) energy. This means that the opposing energies in the local system cancel one another out. The energy is in a 1:1 ration and thus there is no apparent localised movement&mdash;though, as is known, it is never completely, perfectly still.

We live in a world of _localised_ or apparent _imbalance_ knowing that the primordial state is one of perfection. For the only beginning state is a state in which all is at rest, as is believed to be end state. In fact, that is the spiritual (and physically apparent) state of death&mdash;one in which there is no movement, no dynamic.

As a system is in balance when the internal and external energies are balanced (equal), then all systems will eventually attain that state, as they are primed to do, once activated. All their efforts will be expended on trying to attain that state of rest.
