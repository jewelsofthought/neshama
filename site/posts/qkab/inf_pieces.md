## Finite Beings

If we are finite beings, and although fashioned from the cloth/image of the Infinite Supernal Being, we are enclosed in a finite "vehicle", perhaps there is a part of G-d's desire that would like His "children" to return to Him, as is often said in the Biblical readings. The only way to know the path to His door, is through receiving that part of each of us where He exists. Thus, I say, in each finite being there is a piece of the infinite, otherwise we could never have encountered the paradoxical idea of the existence of the finite within the infinite.
