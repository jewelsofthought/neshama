This is a collection (with pointers if necessary) to all the references to infinity.

# Infinity

$$ 0 < n < N < \infty $$

No matter how large $$ N $$ is, even choosing the highest number you can imagine for this $$ N $$, these is always another number, say $$ N+1 $$, that is larger than $$ N $$, but less than $$\infty$$. This is a simple definition of infinity: as the "number" that is always larger than the largest number we can think of.

## Which way [ inf <->1 ]?

Any narrative that attemps to describe the "real" world(s)(s) we live can only be approached from one of two perspectives:

1. Outside [ infinite -> 1 ]:
   From the perspective of the infinite to the finite;
2. Inside [ 1 -> infinite ]:
   From the separate point of individual consciousness expanding into the unknown realms of the possibly infinite.
   This is a gap that the finite can never bridge, because the finite cannot contain the infinite whereas the infinite can contain an [unimaginable amount of finities](infinity.html){}.
