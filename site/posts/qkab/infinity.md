## Infinite Infinities

> **G-d is infinite** in all directions.

It is not that everything is possible. It is that anything is possible. Just as the Infinite of infinities exists in all non-infinite states, it also exists in all states of infinity.

Infinite in all directions, means it exists everywhere, in all/any possible dimensions. From inf $$\rightarrow$$ N (manifest) $$\rightarrow$$ 1 (singularity) $$\rightarrow$$ 0 (nothingness) &ndash; in which exists all possible states.

## Infinity

What is infinity? How would you describe it? I am thinking about it in particular as a defining characteristic of the Divine.
If I accept that we live in an infinite universe, I must acknowledge that there is a cause that is greater than I can imagine. Anything less will result in some form of idolatry.

If something is finite, and has no infinite component to it, would mean that it is perhaps understandable by our (finite) comprehension, and that one is capable of understanding it entirely.

However, to accept the idea of living in an infinite is not easy, and requires constant reminding for we can only accept infinity for brief moments, if at all.

By acknowledging the infinite, we accept that there is always another way. This is the path of the warrior, the explorer. Accepting the infinite in your life, making it manifest in the world around you &mdash; that is the way of spirit.

## Imagining Infinity

Choose a point in your consciousness. See it. Feel it. Hold it. Make it your centre. Now, holding that point, let it begin moving away from you - in any direction. As any direction you choose is possible.

Now move with the point, expanding with it. Stay with this feeling for a while, then continue moving further and further with it.

Looking at this point, you will notice that it has defined a line from its origin to where it is presently. See how your consciousness can traverse that line, and all the points in between. Explore this a moment. Play with it. Watch it undulate. Watch it pulsate, for it has to have energy to exist.

Let this point continue to move, further and further. Now it is moving faster and faster, whizzing out further than ever before. Stretch, stretch with it. Keep the line. Keep the information and energy flowing. Is there something infinite in you that can keep going, or do you have to stop?

Once you reach the periphery of your own consciousness, and can continue no longer, else you will lose yourself, know that beyond that point lies infinity. No matter how far you go, in any direction, it is still possible to go further and beyond that point is where you can experience the Infinite in all its Glory.

No matter how large $$ N $$ is, even choosing the highest number you can imagine for this $$ N $$, these is always another number, say $$ N+1 $$, that is larger than $$ N $$, but less than $$\infty$$. This is a simple definition of infinity: as the "number" that is always larger than the largest number we can think of.

## Which direction?

> Which way [ inf $$\leftrightarrow$$ 1 ]?

Any narrative that attemps to describe the "real" world(s) we live can only be approached from one of two perspectives:

1. Outside [ $$ \infty \rightarrow 1 $$]:
   From the perspective of the infinite to the finite;
2. Inside [ $$ 1 \rightarrow \infty $$ ]:
   From the separate point of individual consciousness expanding into the unknown realms of the possibly infinite.

This is the gap that the finite can never bridge, because the finite cannot contain the infinite whereas the infinite can contain an unimaginable amount of finities.

Notice that the quest goes from 1 to $$\infty$$. This is because 1 (one) is the first, the beginning. There has to exist at least 1 for anything to exist. And from that 1 an infinity can grow.

The journey from 1 $$\rightarrow$$ 0 (zero) has similarities, and is often referred to as the infinitesimals, which is the mathematics of the infinity small. Thus in the same way, we can get infinity close to zero, but never really attain it (except mathematically).

## Numbers

Is it that each number, being a part of the infinite set of numbers, must be associated with the infinity that it is a part of. In other words, must there be "infinity" in every (finite) number as well? If every number is part of the infinite set of numbers, is not infinity a "part" of every one of those numbers? We might have to label this part a composite, as we do not have the words to express the infinite that must then exist in every finite part that is a piece of that infinite whole. The meditation on that is that after you have cut the pie into pieces, is it not still a whole pie? Even if each piece is devoured, they would still, potentially, make up the whole pie &mdash; of course, they would have to reconstituted. The quest here is how to express that whole that exists in each piece.

## Finite Beings

As finite beings, although fashioned from the cloth/image of the Infinite Supernal Being, we are enclosed in a finite "vehicle". Perhaps there is a part of G-d's desire that would like His "children" to return to Him, as is often said in the Biblical readings. Thus, I say, in each finite being there is a piece of the infinite, otherwise we could never have encountered the paradoxical idea of the existence of the finite within the infinite. The only way to know Him, is through receiving that part of ourselves where He exists.

## Finite in Infinite

As with everything, we intuit the opposite then make our choice. When we make a mistake, by its very definition, is saying that there is a "correct". That there is a place where there is no mistake. For that is the duality we live in. Just as the flight plan is constantly adjusted, it helps to know that you will be wrong, that there is an error in your assessment always. That your purpose is to constantly adjust - the statement of constant faith – towards the goal of perfection. Though when you do achieve it,, you get a definite high, called a "moment of grace" – but that is only for a moment. Thus accept that I will err and re-adjust.

If you can imagine (see) finite, you can intuit infinite. Take the number line, start at any number, continue till you reach the largest number you can. There will always be another number beyond that. In other words, any number you choose will always be less than infinity. We facilely jump between the finite and the infinite. This is a basic error for how does the infinite become finite? The very question of creation. Or vice versa?
Infinite cannot exist in a finite object. However the finite world is a piece of the Infinite (or exists in it). So the infinite $$({\aleph}^0$$) is postulated as an infinite amount of finite objects. It does not mean that when we reach infinity all these objects are annihilated. In fact, they multiply. They increase immeasurably. Now, what if there is an infinite amount of these infinities? What if there are infinite amount of infinities infinite times, etc... That is the Infinity that we refer to as Nothingness. For it is not infinite, it is no-thing - uncountable, as it contains all the objects, and non-objects that were, are and will be there.

## Circuit

> The Source might be infinite but the life that I experience is not. Nothing is infinite in this existence.

If a point had to try to include infinity, it would surely be like energy trying to flow into a vessel that is too small. A number of things can happen. The the circuit burns out and you die. The circuit reroutes the energy into another part of the system and you go crazy. The energy makes it through but burns gates on the way. Now energy can flow in and out but will be travel along other routes as well. So, this one becomes an Acher, an apostate, in other words, where there is One he sees two.  However, for one the energy flows in and out correctly ... with the aid of God.

Now R' Akiva only emerged through the aid of God. That is correct. Everything can only happen because of God. However, it also presupposes a personal God. One that cares about R' Akiva himself, particularly. Now the principle is that as long as you serve God, obey His will, will you be aided by Him. The mystery, in the end is to understand the principle that R' Akiva was practising that enlisted the so-called "aid of G-d". In other words, what did he know that I don't?
