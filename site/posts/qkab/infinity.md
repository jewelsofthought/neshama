## Infinity

> **G-d is infinite** in all directions. Thus He/She is infinitely vulnerable too, just as He/She can be incredibly cruel too.

What is infinity? What do you think it is. How would you describe it? I am thinking about it in particular as a defining characteristic of the Divine. Remember too we are talking about The Divine Infinity &mdash; which means infinity in every and all directions at every moment.

If we accept it all as infinite i.e. pieces of infinity, we accept G-d. Anything less is idolatry. Accepting a system, a thing, an idea or a person as absolute and self-evident, is selling yourself short.

We can only accept infinity in brief moments, if at all.

By acknowledging the infinite, we accept that there is always another way. This is the path of the warrior, the explorer. Accepting the infinite in your life, making it manifest in the world around you &mdash; that is the way of spirit.

## Imagining Infinity

Choose a point in your consciousness. See it. Feel it. Hold it. Make it your centre. Now, holding that point, let it begin moving away from you - in any direction. As any direction you choose is possible.

Holding your place, move with the point as well, expanding with it. Stay with this feeling for a while. Now continue moving further and further with it.

Remember, you have not moved – just your awareness, expanding to encompass this point and holding the original center.

Looking at this point, you will notice that it has defined a line from its origin to where it is presently. See how your consciousness can traverse that line, and all the points in between. Explore this a moment. Play with it. Watch it undulate. Watch it pulsate, for it has to have energy to exist.

Enough for now. Let us continue on our journey to infinity. The point is continuing to move, further and further. Now it is moving faster and faster, whizzing out further than ever before. Stretch, stretch with it. Keep the line. Keep the information and energy flowing. Is there something infinite in you that can keep going, or do you have to stop?

Well, know that beyond that point lies infinity. Remember, that no matter how far you go, in any direction, it is still possible to go further and beyond that point is where you can experience the Infinite in all its Glory.

No matter how large $$ N $$ is, even choosing the highest number you can imagine for this $$ N $$, these is always another number, say $$ N+1 $$, that is larger than $$ N $$, but less than $$\infty$$. This is a simple definition of infinity: as the "number" that is always larger than the largest number we can think of.

## Which direction?

> Which way [ inf $$\leftrightarrow$$ 1 ]?

Any narrative that attemps to describe the "real" world(s) we live can only be approached from one of two perspectives:

1. Outside [ $$ \infty \rightarrow 1 $$]:
   From the perspective of the infinite to the finite;
2. Inside [ $$ 1 \rightarrow \infty $$ ]:
   From the separate point of individual consciousness expanding into the unknown realms of the possibly infinite.

This is the gap that the finite can never bridge, because the finite cannot contain the infinite whereas the infinite can contain an unimaginable amount of finities.

Notice that the quest goes from 1 to $$\infty$$. This is because 1 (one) is the first, the beginning. There has to exist at least 1 for anything to exist. And from that 1 an infinity can grow.

The journey from 1 $$\rightarrow$$ 0 (zero) has similarities, and is often referred to as the infinitesimals, which is the mathematics of the infinity small. Thus in the same way, we can get infinity close to zero, but never really attain it (except mathematically).

## Numbers

Is it that each number, being a part of the infinite set of numbers, must be associated with the infinity that it is a part of. In other words, must there be "infinity" in every (finite) number as well? If every number is part of the infinite set of numbers, is not infinity a "part" of every one of those numbers? We might have to label this part a composite, as we do not have the words to express the infinite that must then exist in every finite part that is a piece of that infinite whole. The meditation on that is that after you have cut the pie into pieces, is it not still a whole pie? Even if each piece is devoured, they would still, potentially, make up the whole pie &mdash; of course, they would have to reconstituted. The quest here is how to express that whole that exists in each piece.
