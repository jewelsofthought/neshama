# Quantum Kabbalah (QK)

> A merging/spanning, perhaps even an entanglement, of Kabbalah and Quantum Physics. Using the modern language of QP to explain Kabbalistic concepts. Showing that this knowledge is universal, both in scope, and in time. That the ancient seers had knowledge and understanding of the complexity of the environment we exist in. The names are unimportant, but whether an ancient mystic or a modern cosmologist, they are both peering into the infinite, and describing what they are "seeing". Both use a certain set of techniques and language plus protocols which take many years to master, so as to be allowed a to enter into the hallowed halls of those that peer into the depths of the heavens that are around us (and inside of us). Their language might differ, but their goals are the same. To penetrate the mystery of existence.

## Dark Energy

In fact, esoterically (QK), the dark energy that influences us is actually a collection of this wasted information. Like a virus - which is an incomplete DNA/RNA chain - it is an incomplete message.

In Kabbalah this collection of energy is referred to as the _Sitra Achara_, the "Other Side", or in modern terms, "Dark Energy/Matter".

## True "waste"

First practise, then experience.
Else the experience will not have the vessel able to contain the waters of the experience.

> This is the true waste, where the energy/information is "thrown away", i.e. unused.

## IT "waste"

The IT world thinks that a digital message that is thrown away is gone, but if one takes into consideration the amount of energy that it took to generate that bit, one could see that it does have an effect, and as such there is a shift even from the tiniest bit.

## Kabbalah Science

Kabbalah is the attempt to explain the world we live in in spiritual terms. Based on the belief that we, and all matter, are derived from spiritual influences,
and thus to understand the dynamics of the world we live in, we need to understand the laws, and dynamics of the spiritual world.

Like the study of mathematics, Kabbalah begins with a description of the various elements and terms (and operations ala mathematical operators) that are needed to explain the dynamics and functioning and laws of the system.

Only once those have been mastered to a sufficient depth, can the dynamics be studied.

Similarly, in mathematics, we first study the "static" elements of mathematics, numbers, lines, operations and even functions (which are just complex operations). It is only later, that we begin to study "dynamic" elements such as series, recursion and calculus.
