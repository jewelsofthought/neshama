[excluded_middle](excluded_mid.html){

This is also an expression of what is known as the principle of the excluded middle: if P then there exists a ~P. For everything that exists there is an equal and opposite, if only in potential. Or, with something everyone is familiar with: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction". This applies to energy, but I propose that it applies to everything - though not necessarily equal and opposite by our standards of measurement.}

> For every $$P$$, there is a $$\neg{P}$$ such that $$\neg(\neg{P}) = P$$

**Included middle**

> Between $$P$$ &amp; $$\neg P$$, there is are infinite options. The first (excluded middle) is a subset of this model. This is because one could postulate (even define) the existence of that singular point that is the negation of the point at source, however the only case.

This is analogous to the case of the straight line, as a special case of all the possible lines. There is an infinite amount of paths to traverse between any two point, only one of which is straight.
