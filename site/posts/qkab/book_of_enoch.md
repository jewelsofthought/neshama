As participating in the of evolution of creation, the angels we have called _Elohim_, were sent down to seed the original species with consciousness, and abilities.

We could take the position that G-d could have just placed these 4d beings in a 3d body. However, it is not so simple.

Firstly, in the realm of 3d, 4d is imaginative, and not well-defined. It is what we would refer to as the subtle realm. It is impossible to derive a 4d object from a 3d one, though it is always possible to derive a 2d object from a 3d realm. In other words, it is possible to remove a dimension, but not to easily add one.

As the 3d realm was the realm of the "reality" that was crafted, it is relatively easy to reduce it to 2d, and re-construct said reality by the accumulation of its 2d aspect. Having done that, the boulder that is encountered is what is the 3d aspect. The first way is through motion - which is not really an object, but a situation.

If the original impulse was derived from an infinite dimensional state, then it would need to reduce this higher dimensional state and stabilise it at a lower state&mdash;in our case, this is 3d. {I could propose tha this is the lowest regenerative state.}

Remember that in order to have an object or state of dimension N, you need to have all the lower dimensions, namely N-1 -> 1, to exist. In other words, to have 3d, 2d and 1d must exist.

In the light of that, to reduce an infinite dimensional state to a 3d state would take an infinite amount of steps. Thus it would be far more practical to start from a 1d state. But how to produce that? It would require the absolute opposite of the infinite dimensional state, which we call the state of nothingness. Another way of stating it, is to produce a state that is the "negative" or "otherness" of the original state. If that original state is a state of fullness&mdash;Infinite Beingness&mdash;then the oppositional state would be that of Absolute Emptiness, Nothingness, Zero. That is where the miracle of creation _ex nihilo_ would have occurred (notwithstanding the miracle of fullness becoming emptiness).

That is also why in a sense, the more "in tune" state would be one of emptiness, that we call atheism, non-belief in the Intelligence that permeates the Universe. And that the spiritual experience, which is an experience and awareness of the Greater Consciousness and Wholeness that permeates everything is optional - requiring a certain effort.

For as you can imagine, you need the exact 3d conditions for life to occur&mdash;just life. What we call the "beasts", the animals and vegetation that lives in unity with itself and it's environment. If we build it up, 1d creates a space, and is a position. 2d creates structures, crystals we could call them. 3d is sufficient for life, which has movement and certain reactions to the conditions it encounters, and environment that we find it in. It is "in relation" with its surroundings, by being reactive/sensitive to them. This is something we have called consciousness, and it is conscious of being alive in a situation, and will react accordingly, but it is not what we might refer to as spiritual consciousness.

That is what I refer to as 4d&mdash;the ability to be aware of things that are beyond our experience, abstract ideas, imagination, desires for things that do not exist.

For those who are empiricists, who term themselves "realists"&mdash;basing their cosmology on what is real in the material world&mdash;then this explanation will seem like fantasy to them. They still believe in the bestial nature of our experience and will, under the right conditions, behave accordingly&mdash;as we have much evidence of. This is because there will be nothing that would prevent them from behaving according to the situation and environment in which they find themselves&mdash;what we would call conformists (or the derogatory "sheeple"). This is because they deny that there is any other aspect to our experience except the empirical, sensual one in which we live.

However, if we trace the spiritual "evolution" from the Infinite Nothingness, the Void, to which we apply the No-Name, using the appelation _HaShem_, the (unpronounceable) Name, it becomes clearer.

It might help to think of this soul, _Nefesh_, journey that I am referring to, as a circle. It is essentially, in the words of T.S. Elliot, "to know the place for the first time".

Due to our limited minds, let us imagine this soul journey as a line.
![Soul journey](/posts/img/qkab/line.svg).
Being a line, it has a starting and an end point. Let's depict the start as One and the end as Infinity&mdash;although infinity is not a point but rather a huge, wondrous concept that deserves its own section.

To make it more accessible, take this "infinity" which has no end, and is thus not a point, and imagine the largest, furthest, highest point you can imagine and use that to represent this boundary. Let's designate this point as N, where this N represents $$\infty$$ to all intents and purposes.
![N of Infinity](/posts/img/qkab/lineN.svg).
You could think of this as point the final point of consciousness beyond which you cannot even imagine or conceive anything at all. Perhaps you could call it the "limit of consciousness". As it is said, "Water cannot rise above its source".

This introduces the concept of the source of the line. Before the beginning and after much searching for a rational form of this, the mystics and shamans had, from the very beginning of history, been working with and from ... this Source. Through this exploration, we came up with the mind-bending concept of zero, or nothingness. In the words of Monty Python: "This parrot is no longer a parrot! It was! The parrot is no more. It is dead, extinguished, gone!"

Hold on there, cowboy. How can there be Nothing, when all I see, all I know shows me that everywhere I look, everywhere I explore is filled with things, and now, with energy.

But, counters the חכם, the clever one, we now "know" from the latest scientific theories (QP in a nutshell!) that all matter is made up of mostly "nothing"!...

Before continuing deeper into the debacle, let me remind you that this "nothing" that we are referring to is

1. A state of not-something,
   For we, and what we are able to perceive/measure&mdash;albeit always "incompletely" according to G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem&mdash;is the something that we can recognise. In other words, we are looking for/at something, and the "eyes" will see what the mind is looking for/at!
   If not, it might precipitate a spiritual crises. In fact, one of the classic Buddhist techniques, call the _koan_, is meant to do just that by concentrating on a logical contradiction which is meant to send the rational part of your brain into a tailspin.

This Nothingness, this Zero, is also know as the "point of origin", the centre of the circle, the still point of the turning wheel and the place of transformation

This is why constrain is necessary for any transformation. From ancient times this is referred to often as a sacrifice, though this is a pity, for the emphasis is that it is required to atone for one's sins. However, this could be looked at as not atoning for a sin, but to rectify a local (system) error. This is a spiritual healing technique applicable to living things/beings/entities.

The constraining of errors will reduce the pull, disregarding its requirements, by nourishing it less, weakening it. If it is essential, and cannot be extinguished, it will at least be much easier to control.

Let me explain it this way:

If you encounter an error in, say, behaviour, then in order to rectify it, you first have to constrain, ideally eliminate it&mdash;thus one must sacrifice something for these 'sins'. Which, one could say, is that one has to remove something so that one can enter a state of nothingness for it is from that place that transformation is possible. This is using middle pillar work, which is aligning the four worlds along the _axis mundi_, represented by the central pillar of the Kabbalistic Tree.

Then a practice needs to be introduced to keep that space clear until this practice takes root in the ground of your being, thus becoming uniquely yours.

In conclusion, little can really be said about this true Nothingness&mdash;for there is nothing, no way to express its nothingness.

How does a something experience nothing(ness)? How does a fish have an experience of a waterless world? Be careful, for if you touch this nothingness, it might blow your mind, and you will never be that same again. This is the pool within which the true mystery of our existence, the unknowable, infinite primordial light/energy, exists.

There is a facet of what I must highlight. Nothing exists in this state&mdash;except perhaps for Nothing itself. It can be represented as {} or {$$&#8709;$$} or simply &#8709; which represent the empty set. It is the zero point set, the "portal" to the infinite mystery of true nothing.
