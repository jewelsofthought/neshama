## Speech

What is G-d's speech? Does He Form words in a language? What language(s) does He speak? Can we assume the He Knows all languages, and thus will choose the language best suited to the listener? Would it be a "human" language? When the initiate approaches the Master, and asks him a question. Does the Master give him a direct answer, one that is immediately apparent to him? Like "What is the Buddha"? Or "What is a soul?".

## Vision

What could be the "Face (_parzuf_) of G-d? When someone claims to have had a vision of something that you say is G-d, is that His Face? Could this face not be anywhere, and be anything - or is this particular vision different from any other? And how, not having had the experience before, could the observer verify whether this is G-d's face or not? Who could advise the said recipient? The _Shekhinah_ that rested in the _Mishkan_, did She have a Face? Or was She Herself a face(t)?

Regarding the vision there is more information. It is often referred to as an aspect, which could be interpreted as a perspective. Obviously the only "face" of the Infinite that a finite perception could see is itself - the observer - reflected in the space of the Infinite!

In the end, the only way to verify is with someone who has had the experience, and how to verify that - having no experience in the matter oneself?

Or is there something inside a person that resonates, that Knows, with a certainty that is life affirming, that it is G-d (in one of Its forms) that you have experienced?

That could only occur if there G-d exists inside you too - which should be obvious is we are speaking of something that is Everything.
