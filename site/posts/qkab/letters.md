Is not:

- mathematics the representation of the creations of the world and the natural laws that sustain her.
  Are not:
- the types of quanta of Copenhagen could be a representation of the letters/symbols/characters/glyphs that form the universe
- atoms then could be the words of nature
- molecules the sentences
  Humans would be a tome.
  The strings of string theory would be like the sounds from a violin that cause the people to begin to dance!

## Single Letter (Hebrew)

- There are no individual letters in Hebrew, like 'a' or 'I' as in English. This is because it is regarded as a **broken vessel** if it is alone.
- Every object, everything that exists in the Universe is a manifestation of **Divine Desire**.
- Dimensions = **Realities**
  - separated by different relationship with Time.
- We are aware of being **conscious**
  - Speculum
  - self-reflective
