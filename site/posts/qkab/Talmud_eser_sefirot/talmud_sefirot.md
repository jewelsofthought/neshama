Explains the issue of Tzimtzum Aleph, the (Primal) Constraint,  when Ohr Ein Sof, Infinite (Primordial) Light became restricted in order to emanate the Upper Beings, Neâ€™etzalim, and create the creatures; containing five issues:

1. Before the Constraint, the Infinite, filled the entire reality.
2. The reason for creation was the revelation of His Names and Appellations.
3. The Constraint of the Light around the middle point.
4. The Space that remained after the Constraint was Round.
5. Because Infinite Light is even, the Constraint was also even. This is the meaning of the Round (or Circular).

At some stage, something changed, something shifted, something happened to disturb this endless emptiness, something we call the (Primal) Constraint when this indescribable infinity, _Ein Sof Aur_, became restricted (or restrained) in order to Emanate the Upper Beings, and create the creatures.
