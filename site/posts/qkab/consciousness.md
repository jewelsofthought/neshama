## AI

> **Either our lives are to be determined by human created AI, or by divinely created AI. It is our choice.**

## Consciousness is fundamental

> We awaken to consciousness, but not to [spirit](spirit.html)

## Form

> The only true change is the one which makes no sense!

Form is memory - which is trapped energy. Consciousness is awareness of what has just occurred, and the ability to retain (and even sometimes use) it.

## Message Broker

## Time

> Alan Afterman: _Time, Eternity, and Mystical Experience_.

The mystical path is a path that is focused on mystical encounters that lead to a mystical union, with time as energy.

Divide time into mundane & sacred time.

**Mundane Time**:

- Hold time (captive). Keep position. Control change.

**Sacred Time**:

- The Shabbat is the day that we focus on entering sacred time.
- Actually is "out of time", timeless
- Godhead made out of sacred time

## Journey of Separation

![Conscious Experience](/posts/img/qkab/conscious_seperation.png)

## World of Separation

We exists in the world of separation in the realm of oneness (which is, in reality, the only "Other"). Measurement is a language of/to deal with separation (or those that are separate). Thus, out of the One come the many and out of the many, emerges One. In the bible it says that Ha'Shem is hidden in plain sight (or could I say, hidden from _plain_ sight.)

## 4th dimensional being

As a 4<sup>th</sup> dimensional being, you are constantly aware of each one of these realms of interaction - from 4<sup>th</sup> to 1<sup>st</sup> (and even 5<sup>th</sup>).

Imagine each moment of interaction (action -> reaction) as a supernova that spews out material as it bursts into light. A light so bright that it traverses infinity.

From that vantage point, it looks something like this:

> _From the depth of my being rises the impulse. With enough power and faith, it bursts forth and engages the other. At that tangential moment/pt of contact, the “shock wave” spreads out in all directions, proportional to the impact/power of the interaction._ > _It could be fleeting; it could be life changing._

## Single Letter (Hebrew)

- There are no individual letters in Hebrew, like 'a' or 'I' as in English. This is because it is regarded as a **broken vessel** if it is alone.
- Every object, everything that exists in the Universe is a manifestation of **Divine Desire**.
- Dimensions = **Realities**
  - separated by different relationship with Time.
- We are consciousnessly aware of being **conscious**
  - Speculum
  - self-reflective
