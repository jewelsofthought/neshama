## AI

> **Either our lives are to be determined by human created AI, or by divinely created AI. It is our choice.**

## Consciousness is fundamental

> We awaken to consciousness, but not to [spirit](spirit.html)

## Time

> Alan Afterman: _Time, Eternity, and Mystical Experience_.

The mystical path is a path that is focused on mystical encounters that lead to a mystical union, with time as energy.

Divide time into mundane & sacred time.

- Mundane Time:
  - Hold time (captive). Keep position. Control change.
- Sacred Time:
  - The Shabbat is the day that we focus on entering sacred time.
  - Actually is "out of time", timeless
  - Godhead made out of sacred time

## Journey of Separation

## 4<sup>th</sup> dimensional being

As a 4<sup>th</sup> dimensional being, you are constantly aware of each one of these realms of interaction - from 4<sup>th</sup> to 1<sup>st</sup> (and even 5<sup>th</sup>).

Imagine each moment of interaction (action -> reaction) as a supernova that spews out material as it bursts into light. A light so bright that it traverses infinity.

From that vantage point, it looks something like this:

> _From the depth of my being rises the impulse. With enough power and faith, it bursts forth and engages the other. At that tangential moment/pt of contact, the “shock wave” spreads out in all directions, proportional to the impact/power of the interaction._ > _It could be fleeting; it could be life changing._
