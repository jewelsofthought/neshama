> The trustworthiness of the prophet hinges on the argument that the only reasonable explanation for their occurrence is through the agency of G-d.

The prophet is a messenger of truth, because the only Truth is G-d.

If the people hear and do as the prophet says, it will cause an (r)evolution. It will be a step closer to fashioning a society based on the truth, and as such, will be close to G-d. Thus what will emerge is a better functioning society.

For if the truth is disregarded, how can one wonder where, or how, the error(s) entered the system?

## Future Sight

When you have future sight, you cannot speak of it to anyone (unless told to). If you have to speak of it, speak of it to not more than two. If you can explain or teach it, do not teach it to more than one. For, the very nature of prophecy is an act which changes the future.

Seldom is prophecy speaking of the only possible future. Prophecy only becomes prophetic in the fulfilment of the prophecy. The title of prophet is only bestowed on those who already have a history of predicting the future. Thus a prophet is deemed a prophet by having by his or her ability to predict events. In our tradition, there is only one prophecy&mdsh;that of the coming of the Messianic age.

## Clairvoyant

Clairvoyant literally means "Clear vision". It speaks of one who can see clearly. See what clearly? No that he has excellent eyesight, surely. No, rather that he has "other" site. For she can see the other world(s) that surrounds, and is in, us.
