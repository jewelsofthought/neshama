## Narcissism

_Fear is the killer – but must be tempered with discernment._
_Think a new thought._
_Dare to dream. And never stop._
_There is always a place of balance – the fulcrum upon which the two opposites rest._

Most of my life I have been studying the ancient and modern texts of Judaism and Kabbalah. Combined with my mathematical background, and life-long fascination with the Quantum view. I have arrived at a four-dimensional, many-words view of the world, a view I call Quantum Kabbalah.
This is derived from the insight that perhaps QP & Kab are talking about the same realm, just using different language to describe it. Just as many claim that all religions are talking about the same God, or Divine realm, using different language and symbols to express this relationship.

Growing up in the midst of this, studying texts translated from the Hebrew - with which I am familiar – to English, I had the insight that perhaps both QP & Kab were speaking about the same things – just different language and symbols. The exciting part of this was that the “other” language was mathematics, while the former was Hebrew – neither of which was English, my mother tongue.

Following the possibility that QP & Kab might actually be speaking about the same realm, I ask the question – what shared characteristics can I identify?

My method is one I call **Pure Narcissism**, where the only point of reference is you, yourself – what we call self-referential. The point of interaction, one dimensional, a thought, a feeling.

The word narcissism has been perverted by modern psychology, based entirely on Freud’s idea of this particular human characteristic. I would like to use it in a pre-Freudian sense, and interpret it from its origins – the myth of Narcissus, the Greek youth who became enamoured by his own reflection in the water... and died. Which, by the way, is only one of the ways, most appealing in a grotesque manner, in which this could play out. And, as most of these Greek myths are, this is another of those love stories. Narcissus, rejecting Echo’s love, while pining for his twin sister. Echo, in the meantime has rejected Pan’s love, etc. etc. etc. The Greek gods definitely show basic, and ugly, human traits. And a basic tenet of our culture is that God is good, or for a human to believe in God is to strive to improve himself.

In my interpretation, Narcissism is a topic that discusses human self-awareness.

In my investigations into the material is identification of other as self. An empathic procedure and place yourself into the situation that you are exploring and trying to understand more deeply.

## Vibrational space

If God spoke to us it would be with a wave/vibration. In it’s most basic form, all it needs is to be different, and then there can be communication.”Speaks/waters” . Need to hear the [Chashmal](./chashmal.md). “Feel” the electricity (in the air) when there is excitement => eroticism (excitement/fear -> awe/fear).

Imagine there was a vibrational frequency in the universe that we could reach, but not our instruments. Think of our instruments to measure and read this interaction – which on the most subtle level we call entanglement. They are human made, and thus suffer the imperfections and limitations of humans. Whereas we are divinely constructed, or at very least constructed by the same mind/ability, whether “nature” or something else, to be able to detect subtle frequencies that we cannot build machines to detect. -----> **Merkavah**.

This is an expression of “the waters cannot rise above their source”. Or the music heard can only be as good as the source played.

## Spirits

> _“Know that all the word sof this text are merely symbols (or representations) of the spiritual objects that they represent._ (Talmud Eser Sefirot).

Could not this be the case, except for our souls. Though our bodies might be the representation of our souls – the spiritual object referred to here. Once again, could a wolf not be the representation of a wolf spirit, and the mountain a mountain spirit and the stars, star beings, etc. etc?

## Time & Space

Aug 2019

Everything material degrades, atom by atom. The universal mind, however, is unconcerned as to how long it takes, because it is beyond time and beyond space, being itself infinite.

We, though, are bound in time. Thus we see it as a process, and we need to slow down during our lives, in order to extend the time of life. In fact, of any material (and some immaterial) object – your house, machines, you life, your love, your wealth, etc. Because only by slowing down, could we being to appreciate what we do have, and begin to be grateful. It is the difference between passing through life seeing from the window of a passing vehicle – drive-by tourism, or walking through the villages and countryside, with its smells and sights.

Think of the bliss that you would enjoy spending one evening in love, or doing what you love. How it is timeless and often seems to last forever. Every moment is precious, every memory sweet. That only comes from a type of stillness, a slowing down – not through any fast racing by, on the way to the next thing. How bizarre that is, that the only way one can gain time is by slowing down... for time is not absolute (except in the minds of men), or to say that better, time is not the same experience for each one of us.

Our purpose is to make peace with this dynamic, this paradox.

If we remove time, it produces a feeling of fullness. If we remove space, one of emptiness. These are the doorways to a meeting with G!d or the mind of G!d.

## The Crossing

> Paradoxical nature of life
> ![Paradoxical nature of life](/posts/img/qkab/narcissism.png)

Whenever we move from the mundance to spiritual realms, there is a change of density – a “bending” of the light. Just as light entering water bends, so does the energy as it moves from one realm to the next.

[Dim: In dimensional terms, when one looks at a 2d line from 3d, the space of perception has changed. From being planar to spherical. So it would change from a 4th dim perspective. Or more clearly, a circle in 2d becomes a sphere in 3d and a hypersphere in 4d.

Or one can think of it as looking at oneself, or an event through a mirror.

_Left is right, and right is left. _
_What is up, is down,_
_and what is down must come up._

This is called the “crossing”, for it is the only way to understand what happens when you cross the gap between the perceived and the occurrence, between the cause and the effect, the beginning and the end. And is symbolised as + in 2d, and X in 3d
.
God is one half of the circle, the first half, the beginning. We need to complete the circle.
Light enters that circle, and Life begins. In Kabbalah, Life and Light are the same things. When it is spiritual, it is referred to as Light. When it is manifest/mundane, it is called Life. Simply, you could think of the circle as emerging, and still. God, the infinite being, is all of it - the circle, the space inside and outside of the circle. But something moves, and the circle begins to turn – or rather, energy flows down the one side of the circle, or, even better, the one side of the circle is energised. Think of it as a pendulum that has just enough energy to reach its nexus, but no more. It will need an extra push, some miraculous energy, to crest the top and return to its rest state at the bottom. Interesting enough, this nexus is a zero, or balance point too. In other words, the pendulum will stay a moment at its crest, before descending down, if it has enough energy to do so.

Now, using the principle of the crossing, where up is down, the light descends till it reaches this place of existence, where life is manifest. It has just enough to cause it to reach this nexus, this zero-point, and then it is up to us to provide the energy for it to rise again. Use the pendulum image to understand this. Just turn it upside-down!

In other words, though the dynamic that we are an expression of, is one whose impetus is downwards, it is up to us to invoke the will to rise up to complete the circle. This is called “influence from below”. As the Kabbalists say, “We are part of God’s healing.”

In Kabbalah, creation is spoken of as a circle that extends equally in all directions, and is thus called balanced. Then the Holy Ari speaks of the Light of the Divine like a ray that enters this circle. We have a much richer vocabulary today. We can think of the 10 phases as dimensions, and thus understand how they are intertwined. For each higher dimension can be expressed in terms of a lower one. Yet it also speaks of this as a lightning bolt that descends via the sefirot, until it manifests in Malchut, the Kingdom, the manifest realm. However, we can only return via the central pillar, like an arrow that ascends or climb the ladder of discipline and practice.

Many of us have this urge to rise above, embrace more, than just the mundance aspects of life. All philosphers, mystics and geniuses of all ilk have sought to penetrate, in one fashion or another, the mind of G!d.

Admittedly many have reached hight levels of consciousness and amazing understandings and perception of the world around us. Yet were they truly enlightened, as the Son of God, or Satori, or Moslem Heaven – and is that the space that their consciousness was speaking from? Or were they still seeking?

Judaism doesn’t even have such a concept, except that of prophecy – which no one knows how that was obtained, except that it ended with the demise of the last red heifer) – and of a meeting with God in the Throne room. But no state of enlightment.

We end up with religion entering a stote of mind that would enable us to “receive” and accept the Messiah. Who will arise? Chosen by us, or God, or by himself or by the earthly powers?

And for what purpose, I ask?

- For the glorification of God?
- Or power over mundanes?
- Understanding our purpose?
- Help humanity as a whole?
- Because you are called, have a driving, insatiable, deep need to understand?
- To find fulfilment, peace (shalom)?
- Because that’s just who you are and what you want to be?
