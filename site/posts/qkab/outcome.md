## Intention/Outcome.

Time when future was unknown, the focus was on [intent](intention.html). After having gained some ["control"](control.html) (or so it may seem) - in terms of predictability/probability - of future events, [outcome](outcome.html) becomes as, if not more critical, important as intention was in the ancient and modern times.

These outcomes need to be measured through the same emperical measurements as science is using to measure the "imaginary" energies that are swirling all around us, which we, for many centuries, were generally unaware of (the quantum). And the principles derived by the same principles, and as accurate in prediction as F=ma is in its role of keeping the outcome on target!

> Outcome can only be measured in relation to the dynamics of the system itself. Whether postive or negative depends on the breadth of the measurement of the outcome (whether local or global/general), and its original impetus (what caused it), and its depth (how deep/powerful is its source).

## In summary

The conclusions drawn from data is dependent on the system of measurement used, plus the tools of interpretations.
