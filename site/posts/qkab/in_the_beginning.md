## Wave of consciousness

![Wave of Time](/posts/img/qkab/Diagram%20Kab4%20-%20Wave.png)

Because we awaken here, in this wave, we can only begin to work from this space. Just as G!d started from a point, and expanded equally, producing the sphere, so we “start” from a point in G!d’s consciousness, except that we are not so fortunate as to expand equally from the centre, but expand according to environmental and inherited conditions, but expand we do, nevertheless.

In the Divine realm, it could be said that the point and the circle emerged simultaneously, for it occurred in a place without time nor space.

## In the beginning

In the beginning there was only the infinite void – darkness, chaos, _tohu v’bohu_ – the unchanging, perfect, balanced. This was the absolute totality of the infinite of infinities, _Ein Sof Aur_. Perfection reigned, endless peace and harmony, no disturbance, no ripple... a state of complete nothingness, an infinite ocean of bliss.

Upon this background nothing can be depicted, there is nothing to say or describe for nothing existed independent of this perfect sublime light of existence. Anything said about it, any characteristics describing it, can never express this inexpressible state – for it is unmanifest and thus indescribable.

This was what was before there was anything. It is something that is not something, yet also not nothing. It has been described as the Void or Infinite Light. It is only described as infinite from a finite perspective. How would the infinite describe itself to us? “I am that I am” or “I will be what I will be”... or is it “I was what I will be” or “I am what I was never”?

At some point, something changed, something shifted, something happened to disturb this endless emptiness, and we say that "a point emerged" _ex nihilo_ - out of nothing. We call this "the beginning". Out of this infinite, endless nothingness the something arose. Because the Void is perfect and balanced&mdash;all human terms&mdash;this emanation occurred in all directions simultaneously – which created a "space". This beginning, we call an _‘agol’_, a circle. This is is also known as the centre - or [middle point](/posts/qkab/middle_point/), the point of origin.

It is possible that many (perhaps an infinite amount of) points arose simultaneously. However, one of them is the point of origin of whatever space is under investigation. Mathematics uses different language. It states (and proves) that it if there are many points, it is unimportant which point is chosen, and refers it as the axiom of choice.

## The point of origin

Imagine this spot of density – the [middle point](/posts/qkab/middle_point/index.html#the-middle-point).

What is that point? It is a point of finity – the emergence of which takes an infinite amount of “energy”. One could say that it takes a infinity to produce a single finite point, and the mystery of the circle – which could be thought of as an expanded point (or a point could be thought of as a tiny circle – which is close to what we observe, as the particles that make up our world are not points at all, but “fields of influence”. This mystery of the circle speaks of the mystery by which the unbounded infinite becomes the bounded finite – creation ex-nihilo. The emergence of something from other; the source is different from the result, there being no correlation between cause and effect.

From the [middle point](/posts/qkab/middle_point/index.html#the-middle-point) the universe emerged. We refer to it as the ‘big bang’. There is a version of this creation story that speaks of many big bangs occurring simultaneously.

## Emergence from Infinity

As it takes an infinite amount of energy to produce one finite point. Now let’s enter into this paradoxical state of infinity, and infinities. One can remove an infinite amount of energy from the infinite repository of energy, and still have an infinite amount of energy remaining.

The analogy is a candle that can be used to light many candles without diminishing the light of the original candle one iota. So, even if I say that it used an infinite amount of the energy of the Omnipotent, it did not diminish the “amount”, infinite, of energy of the Omnipotent in any way. And, if it takes an infinite amount of energy to create a single finite point, then, taking into account the Creation, which to all intents and purposes (unless proven otherwise) is infinite, or at least consists of an infinite (or almost) amount of points, it would take an infinity of infinities to create this universe… and any other unseen universes that are connected to this one, without diminishing the Infinite Light of the Creator one iota.

It took billions of years to create this space and by saying that in the Realm of the Divine (or whoever else) there is no time, does not in any way negate the fact that there are also billions of years that happened apparently to our “rational” minds – which need to count and measure such things.

## The starting point

Everything starts of as a ‘point’. A point just represents presence and thus position. Nothing has yet ‘manifested’. It is just ‘in position’. Similar to voltage, which is ‘potential’ energy, and is ready to manifest as soon as it is hooked up to a circuit. Thus the energy of the point is potential, and it too waiting to be ‘connected’.

Let us for a moment look at everything from this point of view. We can think of everything as consisting of points, but it is the [middle point](/posts/qkab/middle_point/index.html#the-middle-point), the point of origin that we could look at, and reduce an event to a ‘point’. In order to be connected, and thus flow, the point needs to recognise or acknowledge some other point. Think of it like a goal. One has to have somewhere one desires to go, in order to move. {[lech lecha](go.html)} [However, in Abram’s case, before he had been given the place to go, he was told by G-d to “_lech lecha_”.] It is like imagining some other point, and then heading in that direction. In a sense you could say that you created a line of energy between your present point, and some future point. The line that emerges to connect the two points is two dimensional, or binary. It could be looked at as the relationship between the two points. Like a vector, which is a line that has direction.

Now these two points could replicate or connect to many other points, creating patterns and objects of immense complexity and beauty, but they would only be able to interact in 2d. How then, does it manifest in 3d, I ask. Is it just a miracle, or magic, evolution or chance? It is, indeed, a mystery.

On one hand, in order for a 3d point to be expressed, there has to have already existed the 3d space. Which makes complete sense. If the Void emanated in all directions simultaneously, there has to be it has to have an infinite amount of dimensions. Now perhaps to manifest this existence in which we all find ourselves, it may have only required 10 or 11 dimensions, and so the rest are irrelevant to us, but they still exist in the ‘mind of God’, or, in our modern and more ascetic language, as ‘potential'.

Whereas 2d can easily be expressed in terms of length and breadth, there is some impetus that enabled these points to plumb the depths of their existence, and discover 3d.

It is lovely to see, in the history of art, where most ancient art had a 2d, or flat, perspective.
