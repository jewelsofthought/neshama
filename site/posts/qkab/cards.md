# Collection of Pieces:

## Quote

> The Supernal rests only on what is surrendered to him

This is an express of the ultimate Good of the Divine. For Good will always give us a choice. Thus G-d does not force us to experience Him. Yes, it is true, that we reap our karmic rewards according to our actions, but one could say that that is inherent in the system. It is an expression of the very laws, whether physical or spiritual, that are the dynamics of the very system (Universe) that we exist in.

## Quote

> Where knowledge ends, faith begins.

It is through faith which transcends comprehension that one can feel true closeness to G-d.

Inasmuch as my intelligence and the root of my soul are of too limited a capacity to constitute a "chariot" or abode for His blessed Unity in Perfect Truth. Since my mind cannot conceive nor apprehend Him with any degree of certainty in the world, nor even one iota of that of the Prophets and the Patriarchs.

## Quote

> “We know that human vision assimilates only a small fragment of the spectrum; as far as our senses are concerned, the rest of it does not exist.” (Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz)

--Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz

### Thought

If we are finite beings, and although fashioned from the cloth/image of the Infinite Supernal Being, we are enclosed in a finite "vehicle". If there is any part of G-d's desire that would like His "children" to return to Him, as is often said in the Biblical readings.

## Quote: Process (Henry Bergson)

[NOTE: Processist, processuality, processism]

> The process reality of being is beyond our cognitive reach (Henry Bergson)

All processes can be viewed as modifications of substances (material bodies).

## Quote: R' Saadia Ha'Gaon

> If the world results in an act of creation, G-d, as the Creator, can introduce changes at will. Our Rabbis limit the scope of such change.

[I believe that this is an incorrect understanding of the Will of G-d. It is perfect, and thus is constant. There is not "willfull change", it is all an expression of His Will, even though we judge it to be a change. ]

> Once G-d miraculously transforms the nature of simple elements in joining them to composite bodies, the only subsequent changes are the miracles performed to validate the prophetic mission.

## Quote: Prophet

> The trustworthiness of the prophet hinges on the argument that the only reasonable explanation for their occurrence is through the agency of G-d.

# Judaica (Personal)

## Kaballah

If the ultimate goal of Kabbalah is to bring people back to Judaism and the Torah & Mitzvot, then it is not the Kabbalah that our sages propagated. For that Kabbalah comes after much Torah & Mitzvot, not before. Kabbalah is meant to lead the student into the deeper mysteries of the Torah, to gain a deeper understanding of God and His Purpose, how the Universe looks and works, what spiritual energy is and thus, how to understand it and its dynamics in our lives.

## Meditation

Bestow להנאת הבורה - for the delight of the Creator. Same as parent/child relationship - G-d, our Father -

## Abulafia

Abulafia could not speak of it other than in the context within which they were all steeped (both him and his audience). Just as a mathematician can only use mathematics to express what he sees, so the Rabbi's could only speak in the language of their teachers.

## Merkava Descent

The Merkava Descent, as taught my Martha-Joy Aft, is correct (even if only for this time and this place). It is our inheritance - a portal to another world, perhaps the "other world", that is part of our true inheritance, in addition to this one.

## Metatron

As each string (ala string theory) conjoins with others to form a "metatron", the primal/root particle, from which all others are formed. It carries all the information for the creation. One could say it contains the DNA/blueprint of Creation. Examples: [Platonic solids](platonic_solids.html); [Hebrew letters](hebrew.html).

It is the principle of greater density, which is a product of "simultaneity". The relationship between these strings will determine the form that emanates. In this state, there is no time, and no space. It is the emergence into space - which has to exist for a certain duration of time...

# Personal

## Quanta

Paradox:

- Quanta not continuous but discreet.
- Yet the "reality" of quanta can only be described with waves (and probability waves at that!).

Perhaps there is a medium (water - ether) which is affected by this energy. As the wave on the ocean is produced by the winds (_ruach_) that move across the waters, perhaps that is what these perturbations that all these quantum hypothesis are trying to describe.

## Desire

> Desire arose...

Desire, the only force in creation, is always towards the unknown, for we can only desire what we do not have. The only thing the Perfection does not have is "imperfection".

But why create imperfection just so it can be returned to its original state of perfection? That doesn't make any sense. Perhaps imperfection is part of perfection, in that in order to be absolutely Perfect, it has to contain both perfection and imperfection. Just as the Buddhists say that the Void is not something and it is not nothing, but is No-thing. The thesis and antithesis are extinguished in the synthesis.

[Creation](creation.html) as a continuous process of synthesis, which contains both antithesis and synthesis within it, else it could not fulfil its task of synthesising and would become fossilised.

Thus the story begins when the One, absolute unity, absolute perfection, becomes Two. That is the true miracle of life, and the whole of our existence.

## Divine Spark

Who recognises this Divine spark? For only the Divine can know the Divine.

It transpires that it, paradoxically, your Divine self that recognises Itself. It is "G-d knowing Itself".

## Evolution

> You can only be freed by someone/something from the outside.
> You can only be freed by someone/something that is itself free!

- Revolution: if it is from the inside, it will only produce another version of what was. Often the same jail. Even the same inmates - just different prison guards/wardens.
- Evolution: All evolution occurs due to outside force(s). However its disruptive effect is relative to the inner coherence/harmony of the body/society that is evolving/changing.
- All evolution is built on the previous iteration, and
- there are always those left behind [Noah's Ark](noah_ark.html)
  More accurately, every higher order of magnitude contains within it every lower order of magnitude as well (simultaneously).

## Dim beings

Manifesting as 2d beings living in a 3d reality with a 4d imagination.
Perhaps that is our evolutionary cycle. We begin as 2d (right/wrong; pain/pleasure; love/hate; good/bad; rich/poor...)/ Everything is a this (me), and a that - that is potentially against/for me. Upon connecting with someone/something else's heart (entering the heart space together), it becomes a recognisable 3d reality. Which is the reality we live in. It has not only length and breadth, but depth too. And now, and then (as has been recorded), we are embracing a 4th dimensional, imaginative, virtual reality that has strange laws and even stranger effect/beings.

## Here & now

- Absolute: here & now
  The only absolute is that you are here, and aware. This "point" of awareness we call "Now". And the place that you experience it, is called "Here".
  Even though the "now" of your experience is not simultaneous with the Now of the occurrence. It has to become the anchor upon which your life is tethered.
- Relative: past & future
  The past is like sight. Depending on the perspective/the line upon which you gaze, you will see your past - which is the only real past you know. All the rest, what we call history, are narratives (generally told by the victors) and guesses as to what actually occurred. But the only experience you have of the past, is those you have had, that you have lived.

To know, to experience, to perceive of something as relative, there needs to be an absolute frame (expressed as a point) of reference. Even if that frame is relative to some greater system, it becomes the "absolute", fixed point of reference. The Axis around which your whole world turns. In order to change my life I have to change this [Axis Mundi](axis_mundi.html) (the central pillar) upon which my whole life stands.

This is like the compass which needs one fixed foot in order know where the other is going.

Bestow להנאת הבורה - for the delight of the Creator. Same as a parent/child relationship; or perhaps a teacher/student; or, best, a mentor & a novice.
Think of the first time a child "gives" something to its parent. How the parent delights in that gift. Whether it is the smile of a baby, or the scribbles of a young child, most parents value it for years. Think of a student that passes his grades, how proud is the teacher. Or a novice that understands the teachings, and the teacher knows that he is on the right path. So it for our Lord and Master, the Shepherd that bore us.

It seems that the constraint that holds most of us, is around our lack of giving towards our parents, and thus our ancestors - upon whose shoulders we stand. We seem to lack in compassion and forgiveness even for those who bore us, and sustained us, until we were able to make our own decisions (even the bad ones). We have forgotten about [honour](honour.html), and respect and decency - which implies, nay requires, some sort of code or covenant. In the same way, and I think this is the root cause, we no longer pay respect to our Creator. But, like spoilt children, we resent what we have been provided, always looking at, and desiring, what we don't have - and never taking responisibility for the mess we ourselves have created.

Shamanically: "Magic of their Alchemical Union". Not personal. Shitty parents. Need to enter spirit, connect to your soul-purpose. As nothing can come into being with spirit, and spirit, working through them, enabled you to manifest. It is all spirit. Do not be lulled into thinking it is literal - that you are the real deal. The full package. That is foolish. There is so much more than you in this world...

## Devotion

Devotion consists of:

- Prayer (words, breath)
- Movement (breathing, dance)
- Music

## Constraint

One needs to practise constraint prior to the event, not subsequent to it. The latter removes all pleasure, making the experience rather torturous. That is the role of the teacher/mentor, to constrain the pupil, and by constraining him, he attains his form. But before that, he needs to be anchored. This is important. First the person needs to anchored, fixed - in the beginning one could say tethered or chained to the goal. This is through an oath or vow that he or she needs to declare. Once his position has been fixed, the teacher can then begin to teach and the constraint will form the student, not break him or her.

### Choice

You have a choice:

1. That of being constrained by your own will
2. or not - then you are allowing yourself to be constrained by the will of another.
   Due to the truism that to overcome your own weaknesses is the most difficult battle of all, thus there are many defeated by their own desires. The conclusion is that one needs help. If one seeks help from another, one runs the risk of falling under the other's influence, and not really acting from one's truth.

The only solution to this dilemma is to "create" an ideal, and to aim for that ideal. The most common and tested version of that is G-d, or some variant thereof. As long as that variant contains the same characteristics: Perfect, Absolute, Infinite, Unknowable Oneness.

### Attract/Reject - Pos/Neg

- In the physical universe, like rejects like and opposites attract.
- In the spiritual universe, the opposite occurs: Like attracts like, and opposites oppose.
  The counter force to that, is that we can only desire (which is "spiritual", not physical - which works on a purely pain/pleasure reaction) that which we do not have! Not the opposite of what we have...

Now the interesting aspect to this is that upon choosing, which is imposing constraints, you encounter, and attract, more choices. In other words, the "fruiting" happens through constraint. So through removing energy from extraneous attractions, one focuses more energy on the choice. Which then grown stronger. And thus produces more fruit. By choosing, and thus removing all the other possibilities ([wave collapse](wave_collapse.html))

However, if you continue to make no choice, and thus take no action, you reduce your choices, until you find yourself in a place of not being allowed to choose - a place of "no-choice", which, G-d forbid, is to be in the realm of true evil.

The felt reaction to the "no-choice", that of allowing some "other" impulse to direct your actions, is one "guilt", and in that place, the desire for constraint arises. [Remember, can only desire what we don't have. After (over-)indulging in one of my pleasures, a feeling of guilt arises. Guilt at having sinned. Guilt at having wasted pleasure. Added guilt because of the need to keep the sin secret. Which often is accompanied by lies... and more guilt. The only way of assuaging the guilt at this stage is by "penance", which means some sort of constraint (which could include pain/punishment). Thus the lack of constraint in that specific area is balanced by an excess of constraint in some other area - perhaps completely disconnected, but in most cases there is a threat that the [clairvoyant](clairvoyant.html) (one with clear vision) can see.

[NOTE: Clairvoyant: one with clear vision. We don't have any names for the other 5 senses. Just an edge here. There is the shaman, who walks between two worlds. There are many types of shamans: healing with herbs/medicine; soul work. They speak of him walking between two worlds. That is because he is interacting with the spirit of mother earth (_Shekhina_?). However, a clairvoyant, in my eyes (which is what I am) is one who sees the other world - whether Shaman or not. A _Mekubal_, is one who studies, empirically, phenomenologically, and theoretically, the other spiritual realms (he is generally not interested in the non-spiritual)]

> What is fear but the memory of pain, and the hope to avoid it in the future? What is love but the memory of pleasure, and the hope to encounter it in the future?

### Free Choice (Prayer )

> Free choice as a turning away

The image from the _Zohar_ is of G-d turning His Eye/I away, showing the whites of His Eye/I, in order to allow us to be human. In this picture, He Acts like a true lover, giving you the opportunity to reject Him (or Her).

Oh the joy when you choose Her. The righteous abundance that is showered upon you. The service that is required and the awesome, miraculous tasks that are laid before me. Thank you, my Guardian. Not measured in riches of this world, but riches of another that are worth far more in this world than any jewel or other earthly artifact

### Free Will

We have been granted free will, and thus the choice to constrain ourselves. For through that choice we become empowered. Of those (of us) who have been born in a constrained environment, our only manner of expressing this principle is by exercising greater and greater restraint/control.

Thus, the principle of _Chesed_, compassion, needs to be invoked, which allows for the imperfections of being human to acknowledged and integrated by allowing differences not to separate, but to unify and strengthen. The more heterogeneous environment is always the more robust, whereas the homogenous, tightly coupled environment is highly effective, and while it's rigidity allows it to protect itself, it is susceptible to sudden collapse as the failure of one component will likely cause cascading failures.

## Freedom

What is freedom truly?

Freedom to

- express yourself
- be yourself
- who you truly are
- realise your dreams (not phantasies)

[Q: Is freedom necessary in order to serve others]

First, one has to learn who you are and for that...

> Freedom of constraint, constraint of freedom

## Aware of the Circle (math)

We measure, another way of naming natural phenomenon.

Perhaps Math is the naming of the energy inherent in the object. Alchemically, one could say that mathematics collects physical characteristics, and through its equations describes the spirit of the object. Be aware that the naming we give objects are just pointers to them; they do not describe the reality of the actual event/image/object.

eg: Circle is only a name to recall an image that exists in my mind, with a collection of qualities and characteristics that I have learnt to associate with them.
There is a difference between the name - which is a pointer - and the actual object. In fact, there is no hint of any of the characteristics of the circle in this word.

## Arrogance

> Presuming to be separate entities and sovereign independent beings.

This is the road to narcissism, and megalomania.

## Compass

"Providing people who are lost with a compass is not going to enable them to 'find' themselves. It is like providing a hungry man with a fish - rather provide him with a fishing rod, and a river or ocean filled with fish, and teach him to fish - hoping he won't die of starvation in the meantime! And when the fishing rod breaks, hope that he has caught enough fish to be able to repair it...

Keep it simple. If he is hungry, and you have a fish, let him eat... then teach him to fish (also so that he doesn't have to eat all your fish!).

In the physical world, with a compass we can navigate by the heavenly bodies. What heavenly bodies do we use to navigate in the esoteric world?

What we need is a more truthful map! Then a compass is very useful.

But the story is the same. One has to learn to read the map. In other words, one has to grasp the cosmology within which the map is drawn, what the symbols represent and also the actual language in which it was written - in order to understand where the map fits in relation to the world and the heavens.

In addition, one has to learn how the compass is used in the mapping system - through a similar process...

## Enlightenment

Perhaps another way of describing "enlightenment" is the ability to have greater understanding and insight into the working of the complex system we exist in.

The shame of this present generation is their lack of acknowledgement of the years of exploration into this complexity by those who are genuinely trying to explore its wonder.

Their arrogance is in their thinking that they are the first generation to wrestle with this existential problem - or are the best equipped to find a "solution" to a problem.

A problem that is in fact an intrinsic aspect of the system itself.
