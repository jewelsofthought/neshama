## Outline (todo)

1. Change the narrative (4D – 3D)
2. Language transference (angels -> quantum -> 4d)
3. Multi-dimensionality
   a) Dimensions
   b) all action occurs @ 1D, “the point”. What is the point (event, conversation, etc.).
   c) Sex – the erotic nature of the universe.
   Pt (masc.), encountering receptor (fem). {Remembering, that this is the process. In order to have a point that is penetrating, one has to have a space that is receiving too.}
   They touch at a “pt”, which, if received becomes a “collection” of points – which form, then, an object or event. Millions of pts of interaction occurring at any and every moment, extending from the center, which was the first point of contact.
4. Numbers (0 – 9 [10], 1 – 10 [10] -> 12?)
5. Geometry (shapes, 6, 12, etc)
6. Space, topology
7. Quantum
8. Imaginary numbers
9. Transcendental states (bliss, nirvana, enlightenment)

## Kaballah (kab_pieces)

If the ultimate goal of Kabbalah is to bring people back to Judaism and the Torah & _Mitzvot_, then it is not the Kabbalah that our sages propagated. For that Kabbalah comes after being steeped in Torah & from obeying the _Mitzvot_, i.e. being righteous, not before. Kabbalah is meant to lead the student into the deeper mysteries of the Torah (and universe), to gain a deeper understanding of God and His Purpose, how the Universe looks and works, what spiritual energy is and thus, how to understand it and its dynamics in our lives.

## Merkava Descent (Personal)

The Merkava Descent, as taught by Martha-Joy Aft, is correct (even if only for this time and this place). It is our inheritance - a portal to another world, perhaps the "other world", that is part of our true inheritance, in addition to this one.

## Metatron (qkab)

Each string (ala string theory) conjoins with others to form a "metatron", the primal/root particle, from which all others are formed. It carries all the information for the creation. One could say it contains the DNA/blueprint of Creation. {Examples: [Platonic solids](platonic_solids.html); [Hebrew letters](hebrew.html)}.

It is the principle of greater density, which is a product of "simultaneity". The relationship between these strings will determine the form that emanates. In this state, there is no time, and no space. It is the emergence into 3d space. Time, which emerges when something exists for a certain duration of time, long enough for us to cognite/perceive it.

## Quanta

Paradox:

- Quanta are not continuous but discreet.

Is this the nature of reality, or is it just because the receivers of this reality can only perceive reality in discreet packets? It is also possible that an aspect of our limited/finite reality, is determined by the fact that we can only perceive discreet packets of information. This is a limitation that mainfests in our very makeup.

- Yet the "reality" of quanta can only be described with waves (and probability waves at that!).

Perhaps there is a medium (water, &aelig;ther and/or G-d consciousness) which is affected by this energy &mdash; which is referred to as "the Will of G-d". As the wave on the ocean is produced by the winds (_ruach_) that move across the waters, perhaps that is what these perturbations that all these quantum hypothesis are trying to describe.

If we could only realise Spirit as Divine Energy, energy that we cannot measure except with a Divine instrument &mdash; which only the Divine can fashion. And as we are an instrument that has been fashioned by the Divine, this enables us to perceive this Divine Energy.

The Torah a manual and design handed down to us by the Divine.

## Desire

> Desire arose...

Desire, the only force in creation, is always towards the unknown, for we can only desire what we do not have. The only thing the Perfection does not have is "imperfection".

But why create imperfection just so it can be returned to its original state of perfection? Perhaps imperfection is part of perfection, in that, in order to be wholly and absolutely Perfect, it has to contain both perfection and imperfection. Just as the Buddhists say that the Void is not something and it is not nothing, but is No-thing. The thesis and antithesis are contained in the synthesis.

It could be that it is only a part of Perfection that would see imperfection in Perfection. In other words, it is not the Perfection has any imperfection in it, it is just that within Perfection, there is a part that exists within perfection that sees perfection as imperfection.

It is possible to express [Creation](creation.html) as a continuous process of synthesis, which contains both thesis and antithesis within it, else it could not fulfil its task of synthesising and would become fossilised.

Thus the story begins when the One, absolute unity, absolute perfection, becomes Two. That is the true miracle of Creation, and the reason for our existence.

## Divine Spark

Who recognises this Divine spark? For only the Divine can know the Divine.

It transpires that only if, paradoxically, you have a Divine self could you recognise the Divine &mdash; for it is the Divine self in you that recognises Itself. It is "G-d knowing Itself".

## Dimensional beings

> Manifesting as 2d beings living in a 3d reality with a 4d imagination.

Perhaps that is our evolutionary cycle. We are born as 1d beings: only know myself, my feelings, my needs. Then, upon realising the Other, become 2d: (right/wrong; pain/pleasure; love/hate; good/bad; rich/poor...) Everything is a this (me), and a that &ndash; that potentially opposes, is other, for me. Upon connecting with someone/something else's heart, encountering true love of some other, (entering the heart space together), it becomes a 3d reality, having depth now, as in deep pain/deep love; deep desire, infinite spaces to explore together, feeding and nourishing one another, getting to "know" the object of desire. Which is the reality we live in. It has not only length and breadth, but depth too. Now, and then (as has been recorded), we are embracing a 4th dimensional, imaginative, virtual reality that has strange laws and even stranger effects/beings.

## Constraint (_Gevurah_)

One needs to practise constraint prior to the event, not subsequent to it. The latter removes all pleasure, making the experience rather torturous. That is the role of the teacher/mentor, to constrain the pupil, and by constraining him, he attains his form. But before that, he needs to be anchored. This is important. In the beginning he is tethered or chained to the goal. This is through an oath or vow that he or she needs to declare. Once his position has been fixed, the teacher can then begin to take him deeper into the mysterious realm. Thus the constraint will form the student, not break him or her.

You have a choice:

> That of being constrained by your own will, or, if not, then you are allowing yourself to be constrained by the will of another.

Due to the truism that to overcome your own weaknesses is the most difficult battle of all, thus many are defeated by their own desires, driven by their selfish needs. The conclusion is that one needs help. As is said, "One cannot overcome the forces of evil alone." Yet If one seeks help from another, one runs the risk of falling under the other's influence, and not really acting from one's truth.

The only solution to this dilemma is to "create" an ideal, and to aim for that ideal. The most common and tested version of that is G-d, or some variant thereof. As long as that variant contains the same characteristics: Perfect, Absolute, Infinite, Unknowable Oneness.

## Attract/Reject

In the physical universe, like rejects like and opposites attract. That is because we can only desire what we do not have. In the physical realm it is a purely pain/pleasure response that directs us.

In the spiritual universe, the opposite occurs: Like attracts like, and opposites oppose. Thus the way to find the spiritual in your life, is to constrain one's physical desires.

Now the interesting aspect to this is that upon choosing, which is imposing constraints, you encounter, and attract, more choices. In other words, the "fruiting" happens through constraint. Through removing energy from extraneous attractions, one focuses more energy on the choice. Which then grows stronger, and thus more fruitful.

By choosing, and thus removing all the other possibilities ([wave collapse](wave_collapse.html)), one manifests.

However, if you no choice, i.e. choose not to choose, taking no action, slowly one's choices are reduced&mdash; until you find yourself in a place of not being allowed/able to choose - a place of "no-choice", which, G-d forbid, is to be in the realm of evil.

The felt reaction to the "no-choice", that of allowing some "other" impulse to direct your actions, is one of "guilt". In that place, the desire for constraint arises. Remember, I can only desire what I don't have. After (over-)indulging in one of my pleasures, a feeling of guilt arises. Guilt at having sinned. Guilt at having wasted pleasure. Added guilt because of the need to keep the sin secret. Which often is accompanied by lies... and more guilt. The only way of assuaging the guilt at this stage is by "penance", which means some sort of constraint (which could include pain/punishment). Thus the lack of constraint in that specific area is balanced by an excess of constraint in some other area - perhaps completely disconnected, but in most cases there is a threat that the [clairvoyant](clairvoyant.html) can see.

<p class="note">
{NOTE: Clairvoyant: one with clear vision. We don't have any names for the other 5 senses. Just an edge here. There is the shaman, who walks between two worlds. There are many types of shamans: healing with herbs/medicine; soul work. They speak of him walking between two worlds. That is because she is interacting with the spirit of mother earth (<i>Shekhina</i>). However, a clairvoyant is one who sees through the speculum into the other world - whether Shaman or not. A <i>Mekubal</i>, is one who studies, empirically, phenomenologically, and theoretically, the other spiritual realms. He is generally not interested in the non-spiritual.}
</p>

> What is fear but the memory of pain, and the hope to avoid it in the future?
> What is love but the memory of pleasure, and the hope to encounter it in the future?

## Free Will

We have been granted free will, and thus the choice to constrain ourselves. For through that choice we become empowered. Of those (of us) who have been born in a constrained environment, our only manner of expressing this principle is by exercising greater and greater restraint/control.

Thus, the principle of _Chesed_, Mercy, needs to be invoked, which allows for the imperfections of being human to be acknowledged and integrated by allowing differences not to separate, but to unify and strengthen. The more heterogeneous environment is always the more robust, whereas the homogenous, tightly coupled environment is highly effective, and while it's rigidity allows it to protect itself, it is susceptible to sudden collapse as the failure of one component will likely cause cascading failures.

## Compass

"Providing people who are lost with a compass is not going to enable them to 'find' themselves. It is like providing a hungry man with a fish - rather provide him with a fishing rod, and a river or ocean filled with fish, and teach him to fish - hoping he won't die of starvation in the meantime! And when the fishing rod breaks, hope that he has caught enough fish to be able to repair it...

Keep it simple. If he is hungry, and you have a fish, let him eat... then teach him to fish (also so that he doesn't have to eat all your fish!).

In the physical world, with a compass we can navigate by the heavenly bodies. What heavenly bodies do we use to navigate in the esoteric world?

What we need is a more truthful map! Then a compass is very useful.

But the story is the same. One has to learn to read the map. In other words, one has to grasp the cosmology within which the map is drawn, what the symbols represent and also the actual language in which it was written - in order to understand where the map fits in relation to the world and the heavens.

In addition, one has to learn how the compass is used in the mapping system - through a similar process...

## Aware of the Circle

We measure, another way of naming natural phenomenon.

Perhaps Math is the naming of the energy inherent in the object. Alchemically, one could say that mathematics collects physical characteristics, and through its equations describes the spirit of the object. Be aware that the naming we give objects are just pointers to them; they do not describe the reality of the actual event/image/object.

eg: Circle is only a name to recall an image that exists in my mind, with a collection of qualities and characteristics that I have learnt to associate with them.

There is a difference between the name - which is a pointer - and the actual object. In fact, there is no hint of any of the characteristics of the circle in this word.

## The lesson (qkab:math)

Think of it in terms of the lesson of mathematics: with a few simple rules, we build the most complex (and internally coherent) system.

My point is here that even in the realm of the imagination, where anything is possible, patterns appear.

## Stars (qkab:science)

What if each star was surrounded by some energy that "warps" light in such a way as to make them seem a certain distance, or look a certain way, or seem to have specific behaviours as observed by us. Perhaps they seem to be along away.

It is somewhat of an extension of the "observer affects what is seen". When we look at them, that is the information that the "light" carries. How do we know whether this light took 20 million or 200 million years to reach us?

So we become a ball hanging in space &ndash; which could be an infinite nothingness &ndash; with little star spaces, each with its own characteristics and each affected by the light they emit.

## Arrogance

> Presuming to be separate entities and sovereign independent beings.

This is the road to narcissism, and megalomania.

## Enlightenment

Perhaps another way of describing "enlightenment" is the ability to have greater understanding and insight into the working of the complex system we exist in.

The shame of this present generation is their lack of acknowledgement of the years of exploration into this complexity by those who are genuinely trying to explore its wonder.

Their arrogance is in their thinking that they are the first generation to wrestle with this existential problem - or are the best equipped to find a "solution" to a problem.

A problem that is in fact an intrinsic aspect of the system itself.

## Imperfection

It is not an imperfection in the perfection. It "arose" in the "mind" or "will" of the Creator to create (this creation). All of these words contain barely a grain of truth, because they are all anthropomorphic, using human ontology to describe the indescribable.

In other words, the creation arose out of the perfection as an expression of that very perfection.

Why, how, what or who, we will never know. For even the glimpses we are allowed might themselves be delusional&mdash;just keep on dreaming the dream. When enough of us dream the same dream, then we will begin to sing the songs that arise out of this dream. And when enough of us are singing the song of our souls, we will begin to manifest and build that which we dreamt and sang.

## Known

If it is know, then it is not unknown. Every piece of information now known was once unknown. For anything to exist it must be know&mdash;just maybe not by us!

## <i>Shekhina</i>

<div class="poem">

The _Shekhina_ is woman
She is the earth and the wind,
the water and the air
and all the beings that walk upon it,
the fish in the ocean, and the birds in the sky
and her source is Binah.

The man, whose source is Chokhmah,
and through Binah, the upper heart,
he can "under-stand" her.

The portal is through Tiferet
the central place where feminine meet male,
if balanced, otherwise, you will pass
through other portals
and that is where your healing
and work is &mdash; to centre
and find harmony between the
upper and the lower.

Tiferet in holding the axis mundi
can find the 4th dimension
through Binah.

There are 6 aspects, expressing
the 3 dimensions of space, Binah
being the 4th dimension, wrapped in time,
which permeats all space, but
is not of space, but rather
of consciousness,
through which the narrative
of your life is created.

## Insight

> Only with $$4^d$$ insight can we understand the $$3^d$$ nature of the tree.

![Insight](/posts/img/qkab/insight.svg)

## Infinite collections

- Infinite amount of infinite collections in the infinite infinities of infinite finites in infinity.

- It takes an infinte amount of supernal energy to produce a single packet of finite energy.

- In every material or manifest object there exists a spark of Divine Light.

- Fractals: The infinite exists at every point.

$$ \infty \rightarrow \epsilon $$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $$ \epsilon \rightarrow \infty $$

$$ \infty - \aleph \geq \epsilon $$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $$ \epsilon + \aleph < \infty $$
where $$\infty > \aleph$$ and $$\aleph \rightarrow$$ is there a number?)

The philosophical stance here is whether it began with infinity ($$\infty$$) or with a finity ($$\epsilon$$).

In a realm in which everything "known" is finite, including the universe(האולם - _ha'olam_), the first issue is where did the first $$\epsilon$$ come into existence. To ask where did the "first" infinity come into existence is, in fact, the same question, for how could there be an infinity without any finites? What was there before $$\\epsilon$$ came into existence?

No-thing, emptiness, darkness. Thus we speak of the miracle of "something out of nothing" as the "miracle of creation", and thus speak of a creator as the primal source of everything.

---

The only thing that can be $$< \infty$$ is finite. One infinity can be measured as $$>$$ than another $$\infty$$ only by counting the finite in the infinite.

So this has to be the beginning. Everything that exists/created must have come into existence else it would not then be able to fade from existence and everything we know in the universe, and in fact the universe itself, will fade and die.

Even deeper: In terms of infinities, one can distinguish one from the other. In other words, in the infinite realm, there is only infinity and nothing else, and we could make the absurd claim that there is only one infinity &mdash; just as there is only one zero (0).

By comparing different infinite collections of finite elements no matter &mdash; a reductive process could reduce each one of these elements&mdash;no matter how complicated&mdash;to a point. We can now speak of different infinities. Each one of which is, in essence, a pseudo-infinity, or one could even say, a partial infinity (another absurdity). This presupposes an element, bound in some fashion, to become finite.

## Balance the Tree

![Balancing the Tree](/posts/img/qkab/balancing_tree.svg)

## Poles

Everything can be described in terms of their polarity. The extent of any space or event will be measured/described in terms of its poles, that is its opposites/compliments.

In math this is expressed as, for instance, $$+/-$$, $$\Re$$/$$\Im$$.

Physically, these poles, these extremes, define the "borders" of whatever is being explored. They enable investigation into the limits of what is under observation.

Especially when investigating the imaginary realm, i.e. the more subtle realms, which include "personal" or self-reflective realms like consciousness, awareness, perception, etc.

## Dynamic flux

Instead of looking at ourselves as some sort of "object" [objectification], an "ideal" to attain, as in becoming like Jesus or some other significant figure, [golden_shadow], perhaps we should approach ourselves and our fellow man as works in progress. I would describe us as dynamic systems, always in a state of flux.

## Grows

Everything grows towards the light. If it is mobile, it tries to attain an optimum balance between light and dark, finally using the dark as energy.

## Wisdom

It is said that Wisdom is the ability to understand the essence, the principles, the “fundamentals” of a topic, and then are able to apply this understanding of principles to other initiatives. Perhaps one could then refer to mathematics as a language of wisdom, and equations as the sentences with which it speaks, the symbols beings vowels that bring the consonants to life.

## Intention/Outcome.

> The conclusions drawn from data is dependent on the system of measurement used, plus the tools of interpretations.

Time when future was unknown, the focus was on [intent](intention.html). After having gained some ["control"](control.html) (or so it may seem) - in terms of predictability/probability - of future events, [outcome](outcome.html) becomes as, if not more critical, important as intention was in the ancient and modern times.

These outcomes need to be measured through the same emperical measurements as science is using to measure the "imaginary" energies that are swirling all around us, which we, for many centuries, were generally unaware of (the quantum). And the principles derived by the same principles, and as accurate in prediction as F=ma is in its role of keeping the outcome on target!

> Outcome can only be measured in relation to the dynamics of the system itself. Whether postive or negative depends on the breadth of the measurement of the outcome (whether local or global/general), and its original impetus (what caused it), and its depth (how deep/powerful is its source).
>
> ## Meaning of the <i>Merkabah</i>

Kabbalists called it the _Merkabah_, meaning "four-wheel chariot."

Actually, _Merkaba_ is a compilation of Egyptian words. All the component syllables are Egyptian words. _Mer_ means "place of ascending", _Ka_ is “spirit-soul” and _Ba_ is “earth-self”. You can see there is a connection here.

## Multi-dimensionality of being

What if all these entities, our guardian angels, ego, consciousness and many such associated beings, are, in fact, expressions of the multi-dimensionality of our very beings. How would I experience multi-dimensional consciousness? Whether my own, or someone other beings.

## Todo

How: Reductionist $$\rightarrow$$ many phenomenon, few ideas.
Why: do not know.
Monotheism: One idea to explain everything. Means "dropping" to earth.
Same as apple dropping to ground, because they can be described by same equations.
5 forces - gravity, electromagnetic, hadronic, weak, strong $$\rightarrow$$ 5 platonic solids.
Rutherford discovered nucleus and proton by a fluke.
Positron: everything has anti-matter, "shadow". Same charge as $$e^-$$, must greater mass
Pion: $$\rightarrow$$ strong force.

| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| $$e^-$$, $$e^+$$, $$\pm neutrino | proton, neutron - banyon $$\rightarrow$$ 3q's |

## Journey into sacred imagination

We prefer to refer to this space as "sacred imagination" rather than the "spirit world".

The flute and its sound are separate but one, just as we are separate from G-d, but one with Her.

Using the feminine pronoun Her, when referring to G-d, except in Her manifestly masculine roles, is an open acknowledgement of the Feminine as an intrinsic aspect of the Divine and not just a hidden, generally unacknowledged backdrop to the masculine drama.

Myth, drama and poetry, inspiration and ritual all borrow from the sacred imagination in their attempts to discover or create "portals" to the realm of the sacred by attempting to capture some essence of Divine Spirit and manifest it in our lives i.e. in the world around.

For we know, we all acknowledge the need for the sacred in our lives. Those of us who are spiritually awake see it in the Great Mystery in which we are all enshrouded. Our despair based on the lack of acknowledge of the mysterious in our lives. This explains the compelling desire to embrace the Divine in our lives and grow it, until it becomes my life, the I have reached the world to come, _Olam ha'ba_.

_Olam ha'ba_ is like the limit in calculus, the potential infinity that we can always approach, but never reach, never quite fully embrace. Until, in some magical, mysterious fashion, passing through a point of singularity &mdash; a dark night of the soul &mdash; to arrive at the place of infinity, &mdash; the sacred imagination &mdash; only to find that we have returned, and are back in _Malkhut_ (T.S. Elliot - "To arrive at the end of the journey, and realise that it is the beginning").

For if, by edit, the "Will of G-d" is for me to incarnate, my "natural" direction is towards מלכות - _Malkhut_. So the return, תשׁובה - _tsuva_, occurs when you no longer look towards _Malkhut_ for your salvation, but change your orientation towards the heavens instead.

{NOTE:

The product (multiplication) of two numbers is a similar operation as the journey of two atoms merging. (see diagram)

}

We assume that we comprise a set of "functions" that are well-behaved, a class that, as it tends towards infinity, actually becomes rooted in the real world. These functions are all continuous, of course... Which is not completely true of our consciousness &mdash; even if it is only from the viewpoint of the physical brain. Or these functions could be more similar to the Mandlebrot set, which comprise a set of functions that have elements of infinity embedded in each one of the functions.

{NOTE: Though we could look at everything as having an element of infinity embedded in it. We show this by asking the question does a finite number have infinity embedded in it, when it, by definition is embedded in infinity itself (and sometimes multiple infinities &mdash; as in a real number, is also part of the infinity of whole numbers.)}

## Akashic record

It s about living a life. Just as the god's of creation carved the manifest universe out of nothing, so we carve our lives out in the divine space granted us.

When you say have a short time left, will you look back at your life and say "that was a life well-lived?"

Do not fret. For you who life has been remembered. Some call it the Akashic Records, the space where all the events of the past have been recorded. Where each one of our lives, our histories, are being kept &ndash; down to the minutest detail.

From this record, it is possible to recreate any being. In fact, it is possible to recreate any element that has ever manifested in the universe. The only criterion is that it needs to have time in its history. No time, no history! of course, the longer the time period, the less local is the history. Think of it like a database rewind.

Now one catch is that it is the very configuration of the spaces in which these events are occurring that contains the very full manifest history of these very events.

## Imagination

What are these images but trapped light? Light that we evoked or resonated with and now hold in our memory. This is how we learn we can manipulate the light.

## Axis of perception

Depending upon what axis you look, creates a different view. Thus time, as a one-dimensional view of space, becomes the way in which we create shapes in our imagination.

## Good and bad

> Oppose the bad, love the good.

It is not the good or the bad that is soul destroying &mdash; but the good in the bad. If it was all bad, then it is clear what it is. If it is all good, then it is a blessing. However, when there is some good in the bad, some pleasure in the pain, an attraction to something that was good, that is the guilt.

telnAnd if there is bad in the good, it it like a wheel that always turns.
