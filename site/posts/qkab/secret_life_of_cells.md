## Principle of Research (of this realm)

1. Singular, one-off, events are meaningful.
2. They are often, non-repeatable.(p19)
3. Extremes are normal/expected.
   - They are the boundaries that define the space.
4. Intention affects outcome.
5. Requires a different protocol of engagement
   - Elements/measure of spontaneity
   - Q: What would a system that includes spontaneity look like?
6. Included middle
   Perhaps from the geometrical standpoint could express it this way:
   It is possible to describe any geometrical object from 3 points of view:
   - The shape itself (calculus)
   - The inner shape that is formed (integral)
   - The outer shape that is formed (projective geometry – from the infinite point of view. E.g. Riemann’s sphere; 3d -> 2d projection of a globe, requires a point in infinity – essentially the “infinite point of view”, or “view from infinity, which requires the reduction/projection from a higher to a lower dimension, needing a “zeroing of infinity”.
   - The only way back to the upper realm is through the One – called the _Shma_ – which is also the call to hear/listen & obey, the One.
7. Multiple possibilities/even outcomes!

   Schroedinger’s equation has only 2 possible outcomes, because of the +/-, but that is surely also a result of the constriction in which it placed itself via the mathematics used to describe the events/information at hand – which themselves were constrained by the measuring mechanisms.

   Perhaps the only/best mathematics at that time to describe the unpredictability in the events observed was statistics, and thus probability waves became the norm to describe the strange uncertainty inherent in the information being collected.

   Remembering too that statistics will only deal with average, or behaviour of the many, and have nothing to say about the individual itself. In fact, only when there is a difference in the behaviour of the group can we measure any effect. Even if there is individual behaviour or any sort of behaviour but it does not affect the overall result, it will be unmeasurable.

   What if we could use AI/Quantum computing to describe these events? A model that expected uncertainty, an “Uncertainty Model”? Instead of trying to focus exclusively on certainty, and build our models with a certain modicum of uncertainty built into the equation, especially when dealing with social models.

   When working with probabilities, the tendency is to only look at the certainty side of probability. For instance, if the probability of something occurring is 75%, we work towards that 75%, believing it is a “good” probability, ignoring – a form of cognitive dissonance – the 25% “failure” that will need to be built into this system. Thus all systems (except the perfect system) have at least 2 outcomes – success or failure – and more complex systems might have multiple outcomes (i.e. wealthy, middle class, poor becoming super-wealthy (top 5%), etc.).

   The only solution, as for all living things, is a permaculture solution – though I like the term bio-dynamic or zero-waste solution. One in which the “waste/failure” of one part of the total system is utilised by another part of the system. In our (human/conscious/systemic) case, it would be that the waste of the system is allowed, even encourage/enabled, to be used by another.

   Thus my point boils down to the fact that whatever economic or social system we envisage, there will be a failure rate – what I am referring to as waste. There are various solutions that have been implemented, like social welfare solution, etc. But any proponents of any social system that claim that they have a system that will completely solve all social problems, or any problem, are conning us, as blithely as the quack selling snake oil to the masses.

8. Open mind
   Belief vs. scepticism (in-experience vs. out-experience == inexperienced vs experienced)
9. All living things communicate. (p38)

   Living things react to these thoughts/feelings/images/impressions – which are not in the human realm of the conscious senses – though they may be received (and transmitted) on another, perhaps more cellular level, which could be broken down further into chemical/physical and other, more subtle, influences – for which we don’t yet have the measuring tools adequate to investigate these subtle forms of communication.

   As R. Stone suggests, perhaps we are asking the wrong questions? (Are feelings the “thoughts” of the emotional body?)

   Living beings are like volatile memory that has a cpu attached to it and they feed off/communicate with, one another. Whereas (non-living) material objects that make up our universe are like non-volatile memory, acting as storage facilities where the information is kept, and used for the various tasks that the “mind” that programmed the computer would need to attend to – available as long as they have electrical/magnetic charges stored in them.

   (Electricity, chashmal, being the vivifying force [of the vivifying soul, _nefesh_]. Light/EMF being the higher manifestation of this force, _ruach_. Love/Supernal light being the highest form we can receive and transmit, _neshama_.)

   But in order to do this, it needs to take care of a huge amount of house-keeping. I believe Windows 10 operating system is more than a million lines of code, and you are frustrated because you cannot get your header just right – unaware of the immense amount of work that is allowing you to effortlessly edit a document in real time. I am not even talking about the immensity of sending an email, or checking your facebook account, and posting a picture to instagram. The millions of miles of cables of all different sorts to create such channels of communication, the multitude of computing devices that order the transmission, that enable it to reach its destination unharmed. Just as we have huge stars and galaxies, gravity and many other fundamental aspects to our environment that enable us to humans to exist and reluctantly, co-exist.

10. Oneness (p42)
    **“Crying out”** as cells break down.
    Are we surrounded by the sound of nature in pain? Anxiety?
    Forest bathing makes a lot of sense then.

    - Unary - Single point
      Cannot know if there is any other point
      Like human life on earth – aliens exist?

    - Binary - Another point exists
      2d, defines a line, beginning and end, space.
      Scientific method is linear, vector – has a direction, a goal
      Cannot expand horizontally, only vertically. Meaning “good fences make good neighbours”. Not working together, collaborating, but competing, and separately at that.

    - Defines breadth, and length – no depth.
      Opposites <-> compliments Love/Hate, Male/Fem, etc...
      **E pluribus unum** – from the many, one. Is that not the wrong way to approach it? We are the many formed from the One, and seek to return to the unified whole from which we were spawned – “Out of the many, comes the one”.

      “Unity is strength” – also produces dictatorship through forced unification).
