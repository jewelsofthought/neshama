## [Water & Chashmal

> Water as communication medium. So is Chashmal!

All was fine, until we encountered [electricity[(chashmal.html)]. This was something we could only experience. We could not percieve it with any of our 5 senses. It was tremendously useful, and people were dying in their desire and need for its benefits and use. We did not hesitate at the door to this discovery, but rushed madly in - as if it was a new discovery of gold or diamonds - and began using this limitless font of energy we had discovered to benefit "all" [which as per usual, meant first those who could afford, or were lucky enough to be born into, access to it].

No one thought to stop and the doorway and ask "What is it?". Because we were still in the trance of the certainty of emperical measurements - as many still are. It is an essentially 2d comprehension of the world around us, rather like the behemoth. And so we rushed in, where angels might fear to tread.

So onward intrepid explorers, armed with your electrically powered machines, and let us see what we can do... Well, we live in the [outcome](intention.html). I am old, but, if you are young, you have to live with outcome of your ancestors creations.
