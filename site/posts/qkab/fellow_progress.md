Instead of looking at ourselves as some sort of "object" [objectification], an "ideal" to attain, as in becoming like Jesus or some other significant figure, [golden_shadow], perhaps we should approach ourselves and our fellow man as works in progress. I would describe us as dynamic systems, always in a state of flux.
