## Aware of the Circle

We measure, another way of naming natural phenomenon.

Perhaps Math is the naming of the energy inherent in the object. Alchemically, one could say that mathematics collects physical characteristics, and through its equations describes the spirit of the object. Be aware that the naming we give objects are just pointers to them; they do not describe the reality of the actual event/image/object.

eg: Circle is only a name to recall an image that exists in my mind, with a collection of qualities and characteristics that I have learnt to associate with them.
There is a difference between the name - which is a pointer - and the actual object. In fact, there is no hint of any of the characteristics of the circle in this word.

For math to portray the energy of an object, it first needs to accurately describe it. As in "a circle is a geometric object that is formed by connecting a series of points that are equidistant from a single point, called the centre. Now that is a description!

## Arrogance

> Presuming to be separate entities and supreme independent beings.

This is the road to narcissism.
