The idea here is that the Tree emerged through a movement from above to below. It spiralled into existence, powered by the energies of emergence. As I understand it, it emerged from the more subtle to the dense.

There is also a two phase picture, one in which the tree existed in potential, and then in the next phase it manifested. There is also the concept of the ladder (known actually as Jacob's ladder) in which in progressed from the higher world (_Atzilut_) down to the lowest world (_Assisyah_) which is also the most dense.

Briefly, and I am not sure that what I have written below expresses this correctly, so it will need some updating, the idea is that it unfolds from _Keter_, down the central pillar to _Malkhut_. A kind of unrolling, falling down and sometimes up (as it says, "One descended, another ascended to be crowned above".) So bear with me, and hopefully I will express it more clearly soon.

The will of G-d is pushing the emergence down&mdash;down being into greater density. Force is always moving in a straight line (as a vector), so it is expressed down the central pillar. But the actual movement of the element(s) through the space is as spiral. Thus we see the emergence of the _sefirot_ along the central pillar, with the outer _sefirot_ emerging at the polarities of along the left and right side pillars.

Zohar: 5 sturdy leaves surround the rose and enshroud it, protecting it with the 13 attributes of mercy.

This is connected with ![The Principle of Five](/posts/img/qkab/the%20principle%20of%20five.svg), where there is a further explanation of the unfolding of the tree.

<h3>1.  Balanced tree</h3>

=> perfect cube, made up of balanced, equilateral $$\triangle$$<br />
=> within this, have all the balanced shapes of sacred geometry<br />
=> all is at rest, perfect.<br />

<h3>2.  The emergence, a birth</h3>

<figure style="float:left">
<img src="/posts/img/qkab/1st_emergence.svg" alt="Balance" width="200">
<figcaption>In the beginning</figcaption>
</figure>

=> The first emanation.
Emanation being emergence of the Divine in _malchut_.
The emergence of asymmetrical structure. Where good $$\neq$$ evil, i.e. there is no balance.
=> Rising to meet the beloved.
It starts with g = e but the reaching out, the desire (for union with the beloved) begins to "shape" the tree.

=> The first movement,
the first (upper) $$\triangle$$, the trigram.
The holy trinity.
The principle of creation, $$ s_1 \leftrightarrow s_2 $$,
  The Word G-d spoke, $$x = y$$
The first sentence&mdash;subject, verb, predicate $$\rightarrow y = f(x)$$
There is now a beginning and an end

Emergence of ellipse, ovals.<br />
Where G-d enters,
separation begins
Removal of nothing to make space for something
1st gaze is upward and outward

<figcaption><strong>Keter</strong> reflected in <strong>Yesod</strong></figcaption>
</figure>

Now we can see the reflection in _keter_ $$\Rightarrow$$ _yesod_
as is said: "as above, so below"
The energies that scintillate in the realms of the Divine manifest here in the realm of creation. The many splendoured dance above is reflected below. For each piece of creation there is a spark in the upper realm that is reflected here.

The analogy is that each whole number is surrounded by an infinite array of rational number, and an even greater amount of transcendental numbers. In fact, there are so many transcendental numbers, they completely drown out the existence of the numbers we are familiar with&mdash;to such an extent that it could be said that it is a miracle that we are able to identify any whole numbers at all. In other words, it is as if we were provided these whole numbers, almost to say that we were programmed to be able to identify them by some consciousness that had either created or was already aware of them.

The seven sisters transfrom the cloud of _keter_ into the denseness of _malchut_. The two energies, referred to as the male and female, direct the show, expressed as the Divine splitting to "do" creation.

<h3>Duality:</h3>

The dropping is also the first splitting.
The actualisation of the duality expressed in _Malchut_ as _Shechinah_ and מלכות, the masculine and feminine aspects of G-d. This splitting is a transformation of the 1<sup>st</sup> idea.

So says Rabbi Chinoos: The crystal was formed in the words "It is good"

<h3>3. Central pillar:</h3>

The first separation
The splintering
Reflections
The chording
The energy of transmutation of movement travels down the central pillar, and causes a split in the middle of the middle.
(Think of the middle child, always split $$\Rightarrow$$ reflects both up & down)
The lighter piece floats up to become דעת
Because it is light, it is also more hidden.
The heavier part of the middle drops to become תפארת, the groom.
He is connected with his higher self through knowledge (hence the push to understanding), so can be filled with beauty and love. Although it can get caught up in the midst of it all, becoming too heady and all-knowing, as there is a the dark underbelly that pushes downward and tests the foundation upon which it rests.

<h3>4. Testing of the foundation, the splintering</h3>

The 3rd droppings
The heaviness of holding creates the 3rd movement

Can't go up, so goes down.
Spits, this time into _Yesod_, the foundation.

_Malkhut_, the created, manifest world, the wondrous expression of our experience. We see the need for the light in the pulling of the spark from its diagonal to its vertical, pulled by the centre spark's only vertical movement, except for the entry into the tree via _Keter_

Sexual energy = energy of (pro)creation = energy of G-d's creating
The same energy that moves through the Divine is the energy that vivifies and enervates us. That feeling of "sexiness" pervades the universe. He wants us to revel in it.

Most of our neuroses, as Freud correctly pointed out&mdash;perhaps having learnt about that from his Rabbinic teachers&mdash; about sublimating sexual desires - denying the ecstasy that courses through our veins in interacting with all that is; the fear/excitement of the live and death. This is how we express/honour the Divine that has created us, through dancing the ecstasy that pours through us all the time, seeking to revel and enjoy His creation, through expressing ourselves sexually/sensually&mdash;just being ALIVE - what an incredible, awesome, unbelievable miracle!

</div>

Actually _Tiferet_ is pulled down by its lower urges, as they are heavier than _Da'at_.

Desire?

Goes down
Closer to _Tiferet_, "attracts its light"

Bounces back up. Left a shadow attracted to the light of _Tiferet_

Place for light of _Tiferet_ = _Da'at_
Removed _Tiferet_'s light. It now becomes darker and heavier
But because it is _Tiferet_, balance, it releases its dark side to maintain balance -- _Yesod_, which ends up in _Malchut_ (son)

Perhaps this is the engine. If we wish to be uplifted, we lift the tree "above" its ground state.

Upon its uprising, _Keter_ remain above. It is so connected, once it has arisen, it will not go down again unless commanded by G-d.

_Da'at_, in union with _Keter_ will be rejected again, and this will start the downswing to creation.

Desire... pulls light out of _Tiferet_ which drops. That is the path of desire. The path of love is where _Keter_ is attracted to the mystery. You could say the desire arises in _Keter_.

_Keter_ split
Up goes most of its light.
But being a Bhodisattva, she leaves something behind. This is the placeholder for her _Da'at_. But here is the information (if you have the wisdom and understanding to handle it.)

Pulls _Tiferet_, splits light up -> _Da'at_. Lower piece is _Tiferet_, but still has light component.

Pushes down on _Yesod_. Drops its darkness to create _Malchut_

Pushes on _Yesod_
_Malchut_ ends up being the creation.
All the rest is just preparation.
