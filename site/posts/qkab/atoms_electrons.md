## Electron Existence

Spiritual - Manifest awareness of itself

Self-realisation, quantum existence throughout, and eventually the energy would become self-aware.

Electrons are spinning clockwise or anti-clockwise. Perhaps the electron spirals from a point to an area of activity and back again, very fast&mdash;faster than we can "see" or measure. After all, what is this “energy” that it possesses? It is coming into being and returning to the Source, all the time (**Hod**/re-verberation/vibration). As $$e^-$$ spirals out, and emerges back in the same spot. Because of the laws of G!d, blessed be the Creator of everything, there will be a need for that energy to manifest and the Lord, in His Loving Kindness, will provide it.

Is it absurd to think of the $$e^-$$ as individuating? To wonder whether it is the same $$e^-$$ that manifests each time? To imagine that it could be a different $$e^-$$ each time? How would we be able to tell?

Many things, some of which we are aware of, and some not could affect this manifestation and its behaviour. If it was consciousness that could influence it, we could never know if it is or isn’t the same $$e^-$$.

How can we always measure this as clockwise, if it is being reborn? How does anything maintain state? There has to be some universal principle, an energy that maintains the narrative, the so-called continuum which we refer to as memory&mdash;and perceive as time. This has to be embedded in the very structure of being. This becomes your dialogue with the Creator. For your memory will reproduce effects. This the way in which I begin to create my own reality, participating in my the creation of my own specific narrative.

$$e^-$$ also moves around. So there is an area of birth. The sphere for the _‘s’_ orbitals, the tears for the _‘p’_, that form quantum flowers of the universe. They are also the place where interactions take place.

The $$e^-$$ would spin on all the vectors available in the sphere, completely “occupying” its orbital. Why then only clockwise and anti-clockwise? Because the emanations obey certain laws just like the angels. They can only manifest under certain conditions, and thus are all constrained similarly. It being a 2 dimensional being, it can perceive only itself or its opposite. An $$e^-$$ of spin $$\theta$$ would only recognise one of opposite spin,$$-{\theta}$$, or one of the same spin.

The neutrons and protons&mdash;perhaps all the sub-atomic particles are actually spiralling in and out of existence.

## Hydrogen bonds

Let’s think of hydrogen as a single, as it has a single electron. It is thus eminently available to form relationships with other atoms, as it is missing its partner to complete the basic, and most primary, shell (s). All other atoms, lacking 1 or more electrons that will only form a part of a relationship, completing a secondary shell (p, d or f). When hydrogen finds its mate, to form this very special relationship that only it is capable of, it gives up most of its electron leaving behind a void (positive charge) towards the rest of the universe, which naturally attracts all sort of charged bodies with which it will want to bond. Because it is so eager to join with another it is willing to give up some of its power for the relationship that completes it.

Carrying the idea further, we come across the fact that unless it is in an identical relationship with another hydrogen atom (H2), the attachment is somewhat unbalanced or polyamorous as one might describe it, as in H2O, and the hydro-carbon chains that form the fats and oils of life. In fact, a very interesting aspect of hydrogen, is that it is a major components of the two liquids that make up most of the form of living beings – oil and water. And those two forms are antagonistic.

“As below, so above” is an expression of the Kabbalistic principle of the macrocosm and the microcosm, reflections of the same Divine intent. If G!d wanted to teach us, would he not manifest the principle of “as in Heaven, so it is on Earth”? That is, use the “Laws of Nature” to lead us to Heaven? Would that not be the way of a compassionate G!d?

There are some interesting examples of this. An intricate one, is following the idea of the brain as being a quantum computer. Consequently we, at some point, become aware of the quantum nature of this reality.

Let us propose the atoms and molecules as Angels of G!d. They react, they do their work as they have been created to do, never deviating from their appointed mission, sacrificing themselves if necessary, but always “providing” the same interface, the same “message”. While we are the uncertainty, with what we call “free choice” that live in a world of probability, or rather indeterminacy, expressing our “living spirit”, living in that it can be influenced by intention and will – that which we call “choice”.
