## Like a bullet (4d)

As a 4th dimensional being, you are constantly "being" in each one of these realms of interaction – from 4th to 1st.

Think of each moment of interaction (action -> reaction) as a supernova that spews out material as it bursts into light. A light so bright that it traverses infinity.

From my point of view, it looks something like this:

> _From the depth of my being rises the impulse.With enough power and faith, it bursts forth and engages the other. At that tangential moment/pt of contact, the “shock wave” spreads out in all directions, proportional to the impact/power of the interaction._ >_It could be fleeting; it could be life changing._

In other words, everything that actually "happens", occurs at the point of contact. Or, to be more specific, in the local area of “contact”, the meeting, or conjugal point.

If a 2d object interacts with a 4d object, although this interaction might affect that 4d object in all 4 of its dimension, the 2d object would only be aware of the 2d interaction. If that contact is 2d, it is a 2d point of contact, and will only affect half of the 4d object/event.

But for any point (whatever its dimension) to manifest, there must be a simple, powerful hadronic type of force that causes a 1d moment of “recognition”, of manifestation/form, yet it is one which has nothing but position (and intent?), perhaps shape and energy – but naught else! In some strange way, whatever the dimension, the only interaction really occurs at the actual point of contact.

Hadronic energy = 1d energy – that is why it is so immensely powerful.

It “holds” these energies for long enough for them to manifest.
