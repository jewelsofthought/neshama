## Like a bullet (4d)

As a 4th dimensional being, you are constantly "being" in each one of these realms of interaction – from 4th to 1st.

Think of each moment of interaction (action -> reaction) as a supernova that spews out material as it bursts into light. A light so bright that it traverses infinity.

From my point of view, it looks something like this:

> _From the depth of my being rises the impulse.With enough power and faith, it bursts forth and engages the other. At that tangential moment/pt of contact, the “shock wave” spreads out in all directions, proportional to the impact/power of the interaction._ >_It could be fleeting; it could be life changing._

![Like a bullet](/posts/img/qkab/Diagram%20Kab3%20-%20Bullet.png)

In other words, everything that actually "happens", occurs at the point of contact. Or, to be more specific, in the local area of “contact”, the meeting, or conjugal point.

If a 2d object interacts with a 4d object, although this interaction might affect that 4d object in all 4 of its dimension, the 2d object would only be aware of the 2d interaction. If that contact is 2d, it is a 2d point of contact, and will only affect half of the 4d object/event.

But for any point (whatever its dimension) to manifest, there must be a simple, powerful hadronic type of force that causes a 1d moment of “recognition”, of manifestation/form, yet it is one which has nothing but position (and intent?), perhaps shape and energy – but naught else! In some strange way, whatever the dimension, the only interaction really occurs at the actual point of contact.

Hadronic energy = 1d energy – that is why it is so immensely powerful.

It “holds” these energies for long enough for them to manifest.

In Kab. the lightning bold descends from Binah to Chesed. This is not accurate and a fairly patriarchal point of view. Keter actually splits into Chesed and Gevurah simultaneously

## Skin/Klipah

[In other words, for anything to happen (in the “real” world), it has to occur in all 4 dimensions.]

- 2 dimensional circle has an infinite set of 1 dimensional points enclosing it.
- 3 dimensional sphere has an infinite set of 2 dimensional circles (that form its skin) enclosing it.
- 4 dimensional hypersphere has an infinite amount of 3-dimensional spheres enclosing it as its skin.

# The Beginning

## The Veil

I cannot penetrate the veil between the finite and the infinite. It is a mystery as to how the infinite can manifest something perceived as finite. And it is just as amazing for the finite being to even try to postulate an infinite consciousness.

## Wave of consciousness

![Wave of Time](/img/qkab/Diagram%20Kab4%20-%20Wave.png)

Because we awaken here, in this wave, we can only begin to work from this space. Just as G!d started from a point, and expanded equally, producing the sphere, so we “start” from a point in G!d’s consciousness, except that we are not so fortunate as to expand equally from the centre, but expand according to environmental and inherited conditions, but expand we do, nevertheless.

In the Divine realm, it could be said that the point and the circle emerged simultaneously, for it occurred in a place without time nor space.

![Human Consciousness](/img/qkab/Diagram%20Kab5%20-%20Human%20Consciousness.png)

## In the beginning

In the beginning there was only the infinite void – darkness, chaos, _tohu v’bohu_ – the unchanging, perfect, balanced. Anything said about it, any characteristics describing it, can never express this inexpressible state – for it is unmanifest and thus indescribable.
This was what was before there was anything. It is something that is not something, yet also not nothing. It has been described as the Void or Infinite Light. It is only described as infinite from a finite perspective. How would the infinite describe itself to us? “I am that I am” or “I will be what I will be”... or is it “I was what I will be” or “I am what I was never”?

Out of this infinite, endless nothingness something arose, a beginning, and we call it a ‘point’. Because the Void is perfect and balanced (all human terms), this emanation occurred in all directions simultaneously – which will create a space which is represented by a ‘circle’. Thus this point is called the middle point, the point of origin [Math/Dim](dimensions.html).

It is possible that many (perhaps an infinite amount of) points arose simultaneously. However, one of them is the point of origin of whatever circle is under investigation. Mathematics uses different language. It states (and proves) that it if there are many points, it is unimportant which point is chosen, and calls it the axiom of existence.

If I may digress for a moment, and propose that each of us has a ‘point of origin’, a beginning. Thus, although each one of us may be gazing at the same event/object, each ‘point’ will have a different ‘point of view’.

## A point of density

Imagine a spot of density – the middle point.

What is that point? It is a point of finity – the emergence of which takes an infinite amount of “energy”. One could say that it takes a infinity to produce a single finite point, and the mystery of the circle – which could be thought of as an expanded point (or a point could be thought of as a tiny circle – which is close to what we observe, as the particles that make up our world are not points at all, but “fields of influence”. This mystery of the circle speaks of the mystery by which the unbounded infinite becomes the bounded finite – creation ex-nihilo. The emergence of something from other; the source is different from the result, there being no correlation between cause and effect.

## The middle point

From the middle point the universe emerged. We refer to it as the ‘big bang’. There is a version of this creation story that speaks of many big bangs occurring simultaneously.

Everything starts of as a ‘point’. A point just represents presence and thus position. Nothing has yet ‘manifested’. It is just ‘in position’. Similar to voltage, which is ‘potential’ energy, and is ready to manifest as soon as it is hooked up to a circuit. Thus the energy of the point is potential, and it too waiting to be ‘connected’.

Let us for a moment look at everything from this point of view. We can think of everything as consisting of points, but it is the middle point, the point of origin that we could look at, and reduce an event to a ‘point’. So, in order to be connected, and thus flow, the point needs to recognise or acknowledge some other point. Think of it like a goal. One has to have somewhere one desires to go, in order to move. [lech lecha](go.html) [However, in Abram’s case, before he had been given the place to go, he was told by G-d to “_lech lecha_”.] It is like imagining some other point, and then heading in that direction. In a sense you could say that you created a line of energy between your present point, and some future point. The line that emerges to connect the two points is two dimensional, or binary. It is referred to as the relationship between the two points. I like to think of it as a vector, which is a line that has direction, though that direction is limited to 2d.

Now these two points could replicate or connect to many other points, creating patterns and object of immense complexity and beauty, but it would still only be in 2d. How then, does it manifest in 3d, I ask. Is it just a miracle, or magic, evolution or chance? It is, indeed a mystery.

On one hand, in order for a 3d point to be expressed, there has to have already existed the 3d space. Which makes complete sense. If the Void emanated in all directions simultaneously, there has to be it has to have an infinite amount of dimensions. Now perhaps to manifest this existence in which we all find ourselves, it may have only required 10 or 11 dimensions, and so the rest are irrelevant to us, but they still exist in the ‘mind of God’, or, as we use in our modern and much more ascetic language, as ‘potential.

But whereas 2d can easily be expressed in terms of length and breadth, there is something impetus that enabled these point to plumb the depths of their existence, and discover 3d. It is similar to, in the history of art, most ancient paintings had a 2d, or flat, perspective.

## The veil again

A mysterious veil exists between the finite and infinite. Another exists between between 1 and 0. It is incomprehensible how the infinite “becomes” finite, even greater than the mystery of how the finite can comprehend the infinite. My experience of life is finite – it has a beginning and an end – and that is a fact we all live with. Everything around me is finite Thus I have a clear and fundamental idea of what is finite. However, as a finite being, I can only approach infinity, never quite reaching it. So the deep existentialist question remains: how can the finite comprehend the infinite? This mystery is called the Pakod, the curtain or veil. It is like a mist we cannot pass through – only imagine. As much as I extend myself, I can never “become” infinite.

Thus I come to the conclusion, that unless the finite has risen out of the infinite it could never “return” to it. In fact, only from the infinite could the finite have come, for only the infinite has no source, no beginning and no end. But how? In the upper view, there is no finite, only the Infinite. In the finite materialistic view/comprehension, the infinite is a collection of finite objects – quanta, particles of matter. Somehow, we have a deep belief that because we are created from the universe, we might be able to understand it! But how can the finite mind understand an infinite cause? We can only track and learn from Its behaviour, Its reactions, Its “communication”. What is communication? It is the transfer of information. Thus the Infinite communicates to us finite beings through the finite things of this world. And it for us to listen to Its guidance.

Everything thus leads to G!d.

It turns out, once again, paradoxically, that the only possible meeting place of the finite and infinite is 0, zero, nothing, the null set, the point of origin. By removing all the extraneous effects, all the coverings, letting go of self and ego and becoming like a hollow bone, I can return to my point of origin, and in a state of Nothing attain an experience of the Infinite. As has been mentioned before, I can try and expand to embrace the infinite, or fill myself up with everything I can, and never reach the end, the fulfilment – the desire, the drive to reach the goal, the end, will only become more extreme, and soul-destroying, as your being become more and more covered in material.

Only way to expand beyond your finite constraint, and experience the Infinite, is to encounter the Zero point, the point of simultaneity, where through annihilation you touch the Infinite pleuroma. Death is the only doorway to life – not physical death! The alternative is to try and become infinite. But no part of the finite can ever contain the infinite, even if it believes it can. The only infinite is infinite desire – which means that it is a desire that can never be assuaged – and that is where this desire ends up, in an infinite loop – and, all our energy is devoted to the fulfilment (i.e practise) of that desire.

That is the discipline: Turning inward, through restraint. Impulse from below ... your impulse!
