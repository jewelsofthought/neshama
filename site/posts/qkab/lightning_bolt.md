## Like a bullet (4d)

As a 4th dimensional being, you are constantly "being" in each one of these realms of interaction – from 4th to 1st.

Think of each moment of interaction (action -> reaction) as a supernova that spews out material as it bursts into light. A light so bright that it traverses infinity.

From my point of view, it looks something like this:

> _From the depth of my being rises the impulse.With enough power and faith, it bursts forth and engages the other. At that tangential moment/pt of contact, the “shock wave” spreads out in all directions, proportional to the impact/power of the interaction._ >_It could be fleeting; it could be life changing._

In other words, everything that actually "happens", occurs at the point of contact. Or, to be more specific, in the local area of “contact”, the meeting, or conjugal point.

If a 2d object interacts with a 4d object, although this interaction might affect that 4d object in all 4 of its dimension, the 2d object would only be aware of the 2d interaction. If that contact is 2d, it is a 2d point of contact, and will only affect half of the 4d object/event.

But for any point (whatever its dimension) to manifest, there must be a simple, powerful hadronic type of force that causes a 1d moment of “recognition”, of manifestation/form, yet it is one which has nothing but position (and intent?), perhaps shape and energy – but naught else! In some strange way, whatever the dimension, the only interaction really occurs at the actual point of contact.

Hadronic energy = 1d energy – that is why it is so immensely powerful.

It “holds” these energies for long enough for them to manifest.

In Kab. the lightning bold descends from Binah to Chesed. This is not accurate and a fairly patriarchal point of view. Keter actually splits into Chesed and Gevurah simultaneously
