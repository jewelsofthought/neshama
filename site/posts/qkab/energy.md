## Fundamental property

> Consciousness is a fundamental process/property of the universe.

Think of consciousness as self-aware energy, and self-aware energy is energy that is aware of the information it is receiving and transmitting - to a lessor or greater degree.

I like to express it in terms of [dimensions](/tags/dimensions/).

The above idea might open one to the theories of _panpsychism_, which says that even a rock has consciousness. It exists as a rock, with all the characteristics of rock, but is it self-aware?

However, there is a theory, a cosmology, wrapped in a practice and the living expression of an ancient tradition, in which consciousness IS the fundamental property of the universe, called {[kabbalah](kabbalah_intro.html)}.

## Subtle vs. dense energy

- Subtle energies affect congnition.
- Denser energies affect the physical.

- It is not a dialogue between good and evil.
It needs to be a dialogue that recognises denser or subtler energies and their relative effects upon us and the world around us.

## Light energy

- Everything grows towards the light (plants).
  
As soon as it is mobile, it moves towards the light (insect) until, as it becomes more conscious, it tries to attain an optimum balance between light and dark (animal), eventually using the energy of the dark (predator).

## Waves

- Energy as the basic material in our world, is expressed as waves that exist everywhere/anywhere at once (or all the time).

This energy has no time or spacial constraints, as we understand these concepts from our time/space bound 3d perspective, though there might be  different time/space boundaries in other realities/dimensions.

## Release of energy

Just before the energy is released, there is the greatest pressure, for it has to reach critical mass/density/energy in order to have enough force to expand &mdash; or replicate, which is an organic way to expand.

## Energy as Form

When energy encounters constraints, it solidifies (densifies). As long as there is some state of local dynamic balance, it can  be perceived as form or matter.

If it reaches a sustainable or relatively stable state of dynamic balance [though this does not mean it is by any means, quiet - it means that the total energy contained within its constaints, is balanced]{.note}, it would be perceived as something relatively stable or static, and one would think of it as energy at rest. Like a table, or a mountain. It would include living beings, ,for they are constained (physically) within a "skin".

[Note: QK: This is an aspect of the _Nefesh_, one's vivifying soul. It is the soul that "rests" here.]{.note}

Energy "at rest" can be [measured](/posts/qkab/energy/index.html#measurement). Thus what we perceive (or calculate) to be a "particle" is energy, quite subtle energy actually, that is "slow" enough to be seen/measured by our instruments &mdash; that have become our eyes and ears that extend into the deepest and farthest part of the universe that we are able to.

## Force & Form

- As energy as a vector, having direction and linear movement; as in linear momentum.
- Form as energy in a spiral or vortex; the expression of a linear movement from a midpoint to as far as it can go; as an expression of angular momentum.

![Two aspects of energy](../img/qkab/two%20aspects%20of%20energy.svg)

[from EnEx 20200802]{.is-hidden}
In energy there are two states: at rest, or potential energy; and dynamic, doing work, or power &mdash; causing some effect, some change &mdash even if that change is just to maintain state. Just as with stores of value, like money. When it is at rest, static, it has "potential" value until it "moves", i.e., is used to financially power some event. [**ToL**: This is where it connects to SOA, or microservices, architecture. Making it actually data driven could determine a baseline that is necessary for a social governing framework, in which decisions which impact communities and people have to be made.]{.note}

## Measurement

We have two types of measuring instruments.

### Real

- which measures real things, with real measuring tools.
- in order be able to measure, a measuring tool &mdash; let's call it a ruler &mdash; is needed.
- this tool has to be crafted to a certain agreed standards of measurement (cm, in, etc).
- in this case, measurement is a kind of standard that everyone has agreed to, so that it can be "traded" quantitatively.

### Virtual

- which measures by collating &mdash; in many different and complex ways &mdash; data collected with complex data collection tools, all linked by the sophisticed chains of mathematics.

This I refer to as a virtual (one could almost say imaginary) field of measurement, which is far more intricate and complex than that of our empirical way of measuring that we are used to. It requires complex measuring devices (that have names like particle accelerators, etc), and even more complex mathematics work out what they are actually measuring. The problem here is not the agreement of standards, it is more that we are not sure what we are measuring or if our methods of calculation are valid &mdash; yet somehow, through some miracle, they work!

Let me give you a simple example. If I know that the answer to the problem is 13. Everyone ponders possible solutions to the problem. The along comes Prof. Dumbledee, and proves that 1 + 5 + 7 = 13. Everyone is ecstatic, and he is greatly honoured for that insight. Even more honour is heaped upon me when I show that it can predict outcomes. In other words, if I have "it" and find another 5 "it"s. Then upon gathering another 7, I show that, as predicted, I will indeed have 13! Everybody is celebrating this giant leap forward.

Then along come Prof. Doodledee and shows that if I take just 4 "it"s, and then put another 9 into the basket, I will also get 13. What a disruption this causes. Does that mean that "it" is different, or have we stumbled upon two 13's?

> This is what happens when we get confused between the virtual and the real.

## Human measurement

In the same way, we have two types of experiences:

### Real: Form

- can be measured
- can be uniquely identified in time and space.

### Imaginary: Wave

> A wave is an imaginary mapping of the sensation that you feel.

> A sensation can only be measured/experienced when it causes an observable (measurable) change in some recognisable (measurable) characteristic of an identifiable
> (measurable) object. This is [entanglement](entanglement.html).

Thus the more subtle the wave/sensation, the more sensitive a measuring instrument is needed.

When a wave becomes **entangled** &mdash; either with enough other waves, or with a "standing wave", or any other energetic event, then it becomes possible for that event to be recognised as a particle. This we call "the collapse of the wave (function)". Thus a wave can only be "experienced/measured" when it interacts with something, and causes some change in the state of the "observer" (or object of or under investigation).

## Energy

> Energy that does not have form and cannot be represented in this world. It can only be recognised through its interaction with some other "form".

It is only mathematics that is able to represent or describe these energies that do not have a manifest form, like gravity or electricity. However, in the latter case there seems to be a form or order inherent in the energy &mdash; a form which is itself only probable&mdash;which we can conveniently refer to as packets, or, as the wont is nowadays, quanta. Thus we intrinsically believe that there will be a similar form for Gravity. Though what if there is not? For all of this has been created not just for God's or our pleasure, but for our learning. Somehow, we were lost, or, as we refer to it biblically, fallen. Perhaps we are errant souls or expressions of some desire for self identity existing in the [pleroma](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pleroma). However that may be, we are here and dream always of the world to come in which the evil that roams the world will have been banished or demolished. And perhaps gravity and electricity will be a koans that lead science deeper into the mystery of creation.

> The only way we are made to be aware of this subtler energy is through its effect.

The quantum arena speaks of such energy. We feel it's effect in our everyday lives with our cell phones and other wireless devices. Yet there is an even more subtle energy, and it's one that vivifies everything. We call it life when we see it move, and an inanimate object when it does not. Yet they all react to input and energy affects their structure and sometimes their behaviour too. Thus they are in some sense alive.

## Light - electricity - water

The light is us seeing/receiving the electrical information all around us. What we call "light", generally refers to that visible light energy that exists outside of ourselves, whereas there is also the actual experiencing of receiving, which we call "seeing", this electromagnetic energy&mdash;that has been called often been called the &AElig;ther.

It is the same in the "real" world we inhabit. While we think that it is the object that we interact with, it is actually an electrical (or electromagnetic) interaction that we are having. That we experience something as solid is because of the electrical interaction between my being and that of its being. It is the electrical force of its being that defines it to me as, for instance, solid, liquid or gas. For, as real as these physical states might be for us, none of those three physical states are "real". They just speak of three different "electrical" states.

We create "form" in the world around us by naming the experience we are having, and upon naming the experience, we both assume and perhaps add, certain characteristics to that experience. Good/bad, hot/cold, solid/liquid... etc. In naming the experience, we can communicate it to our fellows. For we are here to recognise and communicate our experiences to one another, and for our fellows to be witnesses to this lived experience. This changes the emphasis of being human &mdash; not to achieve, but to share our lived experience with at least one other, if not one another... to be.

## </i>Chashmal<i>

[Turning _Noga_ into _Chashmal_](https://astillsmallvoice.org/turning-noga-to-chashmal/) by [Sarah Yehudit Schneider](https://astillsmallvoice.org/)

[Theories of Truth (1): Correspondence and Coherence
](<<https://www.inner.org/torah_and_science/theories-of-truth-correspondence-and-coherence)> by Harav Yitzchak Ginsburgh.

[The Torah’s Greatest Secret, Revealed](https://www.mayimachronim.com/the-torahs-greatest-secret-revealed/) from the website [_Mayim Achronim_](https://www.mayimachronim.com/).

[The Electricity of G-d – **חשׁמל**](https://www.chaimbentorah.com/2015/06/word-study-the-electricity-of-god-%D7%97%EF%AC%AA%D7%9E%D7%9C/)

> Electricity has opened the portal to the next stage of humanity's evolution.

What if we look at _chashmal_ as the full electro-magnetic spectrum and beyond?

> _Chashmal_ is the vivifying force of creation
> _Chashmal_ is the information bearer of creation

When we feel something&mdash;that is _chashmal_. But it can only be detected/experienced as secondary effects. That is by its effect upon something that is already manifest.

The power is always flowing through the system&mdash;even if we only experience it as discreet, with a gap between each pulsation. It does not cease, but when it is in "negative" space, we cannot experience it, except as a lack/no-thing. It is how that power is used i.e. regulated and constrained, that determines the information that is transmitted and received.

> The only thing that can contain everything is nothing.

> The more information carried in the system, the greater is its complexity, and the higher are its energy requirements.

## Water

> Water as communication medium. So is _chashmal_!

All was fine, until we encountered electricity (_chashmal_). This was something we could only experience. We could not perceive it with any of our five senses. It has become tremendously useful, and people were and are dying in their desire and need for its benefits and use. We did not hesitate at the door to this discovery, but rushed madly in &mdash; as if it was a new discovery of gold or diamonds &mdash; and began using this limitless font of energy we had discovered to benefit "all" &mdash; which as per usual, meant first those who could afford, or were lucky enough to be born into, access to it.

No one thought to stop and the doorway and ask "What is it?". Because we were still in the trance of the certainty of empirical measurements - as many still are. It is an essentially 2d comprehension of the world around us, rather like the behemoth. And so we rushed in, where angels might fear to tread.

So onward intrepid explorers, armed with your electrically powered machines, and let us see what we can do... Well, we live in the [outcome](intention.html). I am old, but, if you are young, I pray that it will lead you to paradise and not to some dystopian cyber-prison.

## Energy is energy - good or bad

Energy is energy, whether good or bad, positive or negative, replenishing or diminishing.

Electricity, just as fire, is both and bad. To the universe, there is no difference – though to G-d there might be. Perhaps it is a rallying call, a guiding beacon calling us, challenging us to “manifest” the upper in the lower, using the power of the upper to thus energise the lower.

## Zero Waste (Energy)

If the synergy is balanced and harmonious, then there is **zero waste**, as all inputs will be used and all outputs nourish something in the chain of life [**TODO**: differentiate between local & global in/outputs]{.note}. The metaphor for this is the _Oroborus_, the serpent that is swallowing its tail, representative of the circle. Spiritual food never leaves any waste, as the _manna_ given to the Son of Israel while they were wandering in the desert produced no waste as it was spiritual food.

The more harmonious/balanced the interaction, the more effective will the energy usage be and the smaller the amount of wasted energy. It takes energy to deal with energy &ndash; even wasted energy. In fact, wasted energy is an expression of the propagation of error, for as the energy exchange increases, the waste will increase as well.

> Nature has no waste. _Nothing_ in nature is wasted. Waste being energy that is not used or incorrectly, (mis-)used.

## "Trapped" energy

For something to exist in material form, it has to have "energy". The energy of form is trapped energy, energy that is held in a certain form. Two types of "trapping": one is benign, the other is forced. The first is one in which the being decides to constrain itself, the other is one in which it is forced by circumstances (or outside forces) to be constrained. It has what I call, angular momentum. As it holds that energy static, it is now in a potentially recognisable form. Energy has been removed from its locale. This is what forms it brane or skin. The energy held in a from is required to maintain a certain stasis or, potentially dynamic, balance.

If it is "dead" this stasis is relatively stable, with a very small amount of energy being transferred form it into its environment and vice-versa. One could then define death as an energy situation that is below a certain threshold. If it is "alive", there is a more active interchange&mdash; which could even be judged by measuring the energy of these interactions. Thus, trivially, being alive is a measurement of a certain level of energy.

As a result of this, in order to remain alive, requires an energy input. The entity/form needs energy/nourishment form its surroundings. Thus the inherently destructive aspect of being alive is generally ignored in the full energy equation/interaction.
