## Magic of the Ordinary

What is magic?

Let us speak of the magic in/of movies as a representation of 4d. Perhaps that is why movies are so attractive. The world of the movie magically changes from scene to scene. How come we accept these magical stories? Because they contain the myths of the modern world, presented in picture stories. The myths of our cultures have always been told as stories, and each one of them (those that have survived) have some magic in them. Something that resonates in the human experience that cannot quite be grasped, and that stimulates our imaginations, shaping our dreams and fantasies.

Prior to movies, stories unfolded with words, providing us with the pictures, which were what we imagined them to be. Today we are fed images that are meant to enhance the sense of the words. This is true whether a romance movie, an adventure movie or a documentary. Yet the visual impacts us much more intensely than does the spoken word. It can also provide a large amount of subliminal information. Garnered from the clothes the people wear, the vernacular they use, the emotions they portray, even more subtle influences, like their reactions to certain situations, how they develop within the story, etc.

Scenes are presented to us in images, and the mark of a "good" movie, or interesting story, is that it unfolds in unexpected ways &mdash; ways that we could barely imagine. In essence, the story unfolds in the imagination of the maker of the movie, and we fill in the “missing” pieces in our own imagination, the imagination of the viewer, the audience.

But we don't have to activate our imagination. We can just go for the ride, and enjoy the movie &mdash; leaving our common sense and notions of reality at the entrance to the theatre. That is what a written story requires as well, however, in the comfort of your home, using just your imagination, you can picture the story, "as you would imagine it to be". Here is the essential difference. In the latter case, _you_ have to activate your imagination. In the second, you receive the story from the movie, and don't need to imagine anything. In that way, it is the lazy man's book.

Because all finite things&mdash;which are essentially the things we are certain of, thus we "imagine" to be real&mdash;are defined by their extent, that is by the beginning and end of them. This beginning and end stand as two opposites, each line thus defined producing different possibilities in relationship.

In the spaceless & timeless world of 4d, distance is a measure of relationship (or ratio) of similarity&mdash;one of shared characteristics. Thus the ideal is one of shared spiritual characteristics. Our friends, our true friends, are those with whom we feel a spiritual kinship. Our true love is the one who sees into our soul. Anything else will have one or more opposing characteristics. These shared interactions are the relationships in which you learn about your edges, about what opposes you, and, in order to grow and overcome them, you need to find the love, the empathy, the place of altruism (known in Kabbalah as **Chesed**).

These “measurable” shared or opposing characteristics are referred to as the “lower” similarity. They are formed of judgement, through a description of the measured structures in which we live, and will be characterised by fear, jealousy, and other insecurities. They are born of ego, of the character that you create to function and survive in your life. One could say they are the bonds (and bondaries) of existence. Whereas the “higher” similarities are those that exist in your “soul”.

These two polarities that we have are unknown to the other upon meeting. These upper characteristics exist in the upper realm, and you would need the aid of the seers/prophets of yore to determine whether there exists a compatibility between the couple or not. In a time when we lived in community and the elders knew those involved, they were able to discern whether there was “spiritual” compatibility. In this postmodern era we would rely on machines, and AI, and other cultural apparatus to determine this, for we no longer acknowledge our connection to this upper realm and thus no longer have access to the information.

## Event based (4d)

What if, using the same geometric projection that we use to project objects from the 3rd dimension to the 2nd, we use to project from 4th to the 3rd, but instead of “objects” in the 4th dimension, I referred to them as “events”? Thus a single 4th dimensional event would produce an infinite amount of 3d projections, which we refer to as objects in 3d. In 3d those events would be “seen” according to the particular rays of light passing through this 4d event, (ala stereographic projection and according to the Ari’s _tsimtsum_) projected into 3d space. Just as one could produce an, admittedly inaccurate, projection of the earth and it’s continents by projecting a ray of light from a point (referred to as the infinite point which is also the only “missing point”) onto a 2d surface. Now, we accept this stereographic projection as a valid image or representation of the earth, and many think that the earth’s surface actually looks like that distorted image on the 2d map. However, due to the process of projection, the northern lands appear much larger than they actually are.

In this 4d realm, as there is no time, we could say that “time” in 4d is then measured by events or the process that is unfolding in 4d, allowing us to describe 4d as process orientated. Thus “time” unfolds according to the events that make up this 4d process.

We, in 3d, would only be able to perceive those events according to, firstly, the the collection of rays of light shining from the 4d object, and secondly, by our ability to perceive this light.

Now, in Wolfsen ("Speculum that Shines", p208, and n83, p210), I read about the archons, your _mazzal_ (or daemon). Thus you have an image below (you, your body) and an image above, that we refer to as your soul (or _nefesh_)

## Time based (3d):

In other words, what is swift in 4d, slows down to light manipulated on a “screen” or background, showing these holographic changes in 3d. As 3d is “slower” or one could say denser, and thus less complex, and therefore has greater “difficulty” in representing the 4d event. In relation to 3d, an event in 4d is instantaneous, whereas in 3d, it takes “time” to unfold. Now, instead of doing a “materialistically” based analysis of events in 3d, what if we did a time based one.

That is:

- 4d: No time, no space, only events
  Events occur (in 3d time) instantaneously, or over a long time.
  They just unfold according to the process.
  One could call this realm, process orientated.

- 3d:

Like movies which occur in 2d, using light and perspective to trick our brains into imagining it taking place in 3d. A type of virtual hypnosis... or delusional state in which we think something actually happened in 3d. Our reactions match whatever occurred in the imagined event projected onto the 3d screen of our perception, to which we are programmed to respond in a 2d fashion.

Thus in our mind’s eye, the story of the movie unfolds in 3d. And we experience it in 4d, the imaginary realm. In an hour we can experience a lifetime(s). We love, laugh, cry with the people in the story. We identify with them, and for a moment live their lives.

In 4d, an event, a “moment”, could in 3d, be a lifetime, a moment, or a millennia.

- 5d – idea/will of G-d,supernal thought;
- 4d – + event,
- 3d – + time,
- 2d – + polarity, that manifest the flow from here to there, as the only movement is from point A to point B.

2d being defined by a this and a that, beginning point and end point, in which exists a relationship, which, in order for us to comprehend we define as a line (which is just a continuous set of points) which we collapse into binary system, a this and a that, then rationalise as the only, necessary points that make up the object/event as we perceive it. Ending up with a barebones description of the event unfolding from a this to a that, a “to be” or “not to be”.

## Messiah

Thus the coming of the Messiah is an event – as it determined and thus emerges from the upper realm, and therefore it is not time based, but event based.

That is why we speak of the “influence/impulse from below”, as it is an spiritual event that has to first occur here. As the Sages say, only when we all acknowledge and live in the knowledge of the Divine influence in and over all our lives, will the Messiah appear. It is not a “material” or “technical” solution, but a shift or opening of our consciousness that is required. Once it happens here—the below—the Messianic “time” will be upon us—and we will create/manifest the Messianic Age.

## Space of the I

We have to move from the space of the ‘I’, the ‘1’, and embrace the One-ness—the One that contains everything, and expressed the greater unity within which we experience our existence. We can then begin to experience the “Messianic” age, a time not of You or I, but We—the We that is made up of the You’s and I’s, but yet is so much more. Just as all 4d objects are made of 3d objects, yet are so much more.

## Bridge between

Think of it not as two realms, the material and the spiritual, but as two countries. And we are a bridge that crossed between these two countries.

Here the principle of similarity will influence the ease of passing between the two countries. In other words, if one’s spiritual attitude as manifest in this world has similar characteristics, will be easier to pass through the border . For instance, passing between European countries, will be easier than going from an African to a European country.

So it is in the spiritual/material realm.

Heaven & Earth, two abodes—albeit abodes of consciousness.

Through action in the world we communicate our consciousness to one another.

Like ships meeting in emptiness we call space. First there is communication, then there is connection, and then there is possible transference.
