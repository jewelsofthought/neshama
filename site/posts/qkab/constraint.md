## The constraint (Gevurah)

That it takes an infinite amount of energy to produce a finite packet of energy is an expression of constraint (_tzimtzum_) inherent in this world&mdash;which is essentially a world of limits. Because in order for the finite to emerge from the infinite, the infinite has to constrain itself! Creating a world in which the infinite expresses itself is an expression of the finite inherent in the infinite.

$$\infty \longrightarrow {\epsilon} <  0 $$
$$0 < \epsilon \longrightarrow {\infty^+} $$

Any form of order requires constraint.

## Power exchange

Another view of mercy as the infinite constraining itself to become finite, to allow the finite to exist. Constraint being another aspect of Love.

And love always has an element of power (or energy). We speak of the power exchange inherent in all relations, because in order for there to be any relationship, or flow of energy, there has to be a difference, an energy differential between the two interacting elements, else there can be no exchange.

This becomes a journey that is an exploration of power in love and love in power: _Chesed_ & _Gevurah_

## The Veil

A mysterious veil exists between the finite and infinite. Another exists between between the finite and zero. It is incomprehensible how the infinite "becomes" finite, yet, once it "emanates", it will eventually reach zero, and "disappear" thus transforming into that which we cannot measure.

My experience of life is finite – it has a beginning and an end – and that is a fact we all live with. Everything around me is finite Thus I have a clear and fundamental idea of what is finite. However, as a finite being, I can only approach infinity, never quite reach it. So the question remains: how can the finite comprehend the infinite? To explore this mystery is like trying to peek behind the curtain that veils the mystery of union. As we reach close to it, it rises like a mist we cannot pass through – only imagine. As much as I extend myself, I can never "become" infinite&mdash;but I can have an experience of endlessness.

I cannot penetrate the veil between the finite and the infinite, but there is something in me that can. It will always be a mystery as to how the infinite can manifest something that is aware of itself as finite. How astounding is it for this finite being to even postulate an infinite consciousness. A consciousness that is other than itself.

Thus unless the finite has risen out of the infinite it could never "return" to it. Actually, only from the infinite could the finite have come, for only the infinite has no source, no beginning and no end.

In the upper realm, there is no finite, only the Infinite. In the finite view/comprehension, the infinite is a collection of finite objects – particles of matter. We believe that because we are created from the universe, we might be able to understand it! But how can the finite mind understand an infinite cause? We can only track and learn from Its behaviour, Its reactions, Its "communication".

What is communication? It is the transfer of information. Thus the Infinite communicates to us finite beings through the finite things of this world. And it for us to listen to the Infinite guidance.

Everything thus leads to G!d.

It turns out, once again, paradoxically, that the only possible meeting place of the finite and infinite is 0, zero, nothing&mdash;the point of origin. By removing all the extraneous effects, all the coverings, letting go of self and ego and becoming like a hollow bone, it is possible to return to my point of origin, and in a state of Nothing attain an experience of the Infinite. As has been mentioned before, I can try and expand to embrace the infinite, or fill myself up with everything I can, and never reach the end, the fulfilment. The desire, the drive to reach the goal, the end, will only become more extreme, and soul-destroying, as your being become more and more covered in material.

Only way to expand beyond your finite constraint, and experience the Infinite, is to encounter the Zero point, the point of simultaneity, where through annihilation you touch the Infinite pleroma. Death is the only doorway to life – not physical death! The alternative is to try and become infinite. But no part of the finite can ever contain the infinite, even if it believes it can. The only infinite is infinite desire – which means that it is a desire that can never be assuaged – and that is where this desire ends up, in an infinite loop – until all our energy will be devoted to the fulfilment (i.e practise) of that desire.

That is the discipline: Turning inward, through restraint. Coming to terms with your impulse ... the pulse from below. And by meeting it, and acknowledging it, turning into the life affirming/positive energy.
