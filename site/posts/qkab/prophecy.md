1. [Future Sight](#future-sight)
2. [Clairvoyant](#clairvoyant)

## Future Sight

When you have future sight, you cannot speak of it to anyone (unless told to). If you have to speak of it, speak of it not more than 2. If you can explain or teach it, do not teach it to more than one person. For, the very nature of prophecy is an act which changes the future.

Seldom is prophecy speaking of the only possible future. Prophecy only become prophetic in the fulfillment of the prophecy. And the title of pophet is only bestowed on those who already have a history of predicting the future. Thus a prophet is deemed a prophet by having experiencing his or her ability to predict events. In our tradition, there is only one prophecy - that of the coming of the Messianic age.

## Clairvoyant

There are many interpretations of the word Clairvoyant, but the one I want to work with here, is the one that literally means "Clear vision", because clairvoyance is a form of shamanism. It is a shaman who can see clearly. See what clearly... why the other world (or worlds) around us. I, for one, have experienced another reality - a so-called death experience - and since, am not sure if the "other" realities I have encountered are just parts of the first, or are really different realities.

U not equal to L
L subset of U:

- Is L completely contained in U?
