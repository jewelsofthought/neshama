The ray of light of Infinity evolves into ordinary reality through five "Worlds" which express five levels of its progressive "enclothement"; that is, through five basic levels of consciousness. "Higher" and "lower" Worlds refer to the degree the light of Infinity is concealed; a higer World is not in any way "closer" spatially to G-d than a lower World. Rather, each of the five levels of consciousness is enclothed with the "garment" of the other; each WOrld is the soul or inner-consciousness of the succeeding one. All five Worlds exist one within the other within the other in each moment of consciousness. The principle of inter-inclusion (_hitcalelut_) is conscidered fundamental to all truth (![Fig 6](</posts/img/qkab/Kab_Consciousness_(Fig%206).jpg>)).

The five Worlds are levels of consciousness; an infinite number of screenings of the immanent light would not result in physical matter which involves the creative power of transcendent Light. At the lowest levels of consciousness are fantasies, dreams and nightmares. Nevertheless, important _qualitative_ differences or jumps exist between the Worlds themselves. This is especially the case between the two higher as compared to the three lower Worlds; and, as well, between all the Worlds of consciousness and the physical realm. The World of _Assiyah_ (literally "making" or action, "doing") is the dimension of ordinary consciousness. They physical world also takes place at this level.

The following simplified example, using five developmental stages involved in building a "house" (the Creation), may illustrate the distinction between the worlds:
(1) _Adam Kadmon_ (Primordial Man): the will to build the house;
(2) _Atzilut_ (Emanation): the wisdom as to how build a house;
(3) _Briah_ (Creation): the general concept of the house, its architectural design;
(4) _Yetzirah_ (Formation): the building instructions and detailed construction plan;
(5) _Assiyah_ (Action Making): the final building of the house, the actualisation of the original will and purpose.
