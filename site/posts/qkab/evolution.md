## Evolution not revolution

<blockquote style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 2rem">
We do not want to revolve, but instead evolve.<br />
Bro, in order to evolve, you need resolve.<br />
We do not want a revolution, but some resolution -<br />
Though what we are doing to our Mother, is truly revol-u-ting.
</blockquote>

We do not seek resolution, or revolt – though what we are doing to our planet, and the living beings both animal and plant, is revolting. We believe it is necessary to evolve. Whatever emerges will have to come from this time and place, not from some imaginary place that doesn’t yet exist. It is like trying to work out where a rock that is thrown will land. We can guess at best, until we have the equations to calculate its ballistics. And from that understanding we can then manufacture bullets – specially shaped rocks that we can aim and project at high speed to a specific target.

## Messianic Narrative

The messianic narrative is actually a revolutionary credo. It is not a “religious” narrative, as such, describing a journey to God, or some perfected “superior” type of human. It proposes a way to find a place of harmony, and balance that is not directed by man, or by some man that has assumed the right god-like powers over his fellow man.

The gospels were written in Greek, a language which neither Jesus nor most of his disciples, certainly not those who were purported to have written the gospels, were familiar with.

Moses calls the Jewish nation with his “Let my people go. Let them be free to worship their G-d.” It is a call to freedom, but freedom for a purpose. Not just as a freedom from the oppressor, but a freedom to serve a higher purpose, a king that is not a human king, but one who rules from the Heavens. But in order to even reach these heights, firstly we have to free ourselves from the slave mentality, which is the real cause of human bondage. This is what the festival of passover celebrates “Our freedom from slavery. We were oppressed by Pharoah, and we yearned to be free.” It was not a call to sovereignty either. In fact, as the story goes, it began as a request to be able to be able to spend three – yes, only three – days in the desert to carry out our ancestral prayers to our G-d. Upon this being refused, there arose a protest movement, which Moses spearheaded. Perhaps he was at the “right” place at the “right” time – what we call “an act of faith” or “karma”, but previously it was known as “God’s Will” or “Destiny”.

Exodus is a great story of a people overcoming oppression and tyranny. On the mundane it contains beautiful lessons, especially the deep one of "freedom for" what, instead of simply freedom from human or external bondage.

However, in its magical and divine representation, in its narration of the incredible miracles that took place, both cause one to question its "reality". Thus it becomes a test of faith.

Human bondage has to be done carefully, a delicate balance between the needs and desires of the people. Divine/universal servitude, is the "natural" limits and constraints of the system in which we exist. It has "involuntary" needs and natural limitation, many of which are described through our understanding of the laws of nature/nuture, physics, etc.

The better we understand the truth of such limitations, of the laws of the universe around us (which one could interpret as an expression of the Will of G-d), the more harmonious and successful will be our society.

Freedom from human bondage, not Divine bondage (service), which is, according to our faith, the essential meaning of human responsibility&mdash;to be serving the essential Will of G-d!

The journey (as we very aware) does not end here either. For it seems that if we are not under human bondage, then our default would be to be held by the “universal” laws of being, or as some would say, “G-d’s laws” which are the laws that are embedded in the universe. The very laws, like $$e = mc^2$$ or $$f = ma$$, that science claims to have “discovered”&mdash;ignoring the fact that the laws were already in existence long before we “discovered” them. Thus avoiding the uncomfortable fact that we are like children discovering the garden in which we were raised.

A note on “the Will of God”. Our tendency is to anthropomorphise it, and think of it in a human context. But we are here referring to the Infinite Will&mdash;_Ohr Ein Sof_&mdash;which permeates all existence, living and non-living, and is expressed in every bit of creation.

## Akashic record

The ancients left us with something that was termed the "Akashic records", rather like the Book of Life, in which everything that occurred was written. It was scoffed at for many years, but science stumbled upon something which they have called the "microwave background", which has been around since the big bang. This background (apparently one amongst many) contains much information about the moment the universe "emerged" into existence. Now that scientists can only read the things that scientists can read, and scoff at other attempts to elicit information from such phenomenon, could one thus not assume that with the correct instruments, it would be possible to elicit other information about the history of our universe?

After all, even space, once called empty space, is filled with an immense amount of energy&mdash;much of which science only acknowledges as energy, and cannot interpret with the limited tool of mathematics as its option. Mathematics will interpret in mathematics, which is essentially mathematical, and thus in the mind. Mathematics has no ability to interpret the things that are human, and of the senses, nor, it has become apparent, the peculiar sentience of human beings.

This is the achilles heel of science for it is denigrates the role and perceptive capacity of the human being. By denying that we have a soul, which is an instrument of great subtlety and flexibility with which we actually experience the universe around us.

In fact, we cannot deny , that perhaps it is this that is one of its greatest strengths as well.

Where mathematics actually comes from, and how come we are able to even conceive of such ideas as these abstractions that we scratch around in, and "prove" mathematically, is still in debate. In essence we seem to have been given mathematics as a tool to describe the world around us in a very rich language. However, that we have reached the position of granting more relevance to the role of the language, rather than base our Wisdom on the very experience thereof.

At the same time, the language of modern psychology, and its claim to be representing the space that religious archetypes and myths had spoken of, began to influence the stage on which we lived. Which has become a useful tool to denigrate human experience, that cannot be empirically, or rationally explained, to the abnormal, thus furthering the invalidation of any part of our human existence that does not fit into whatever narrative is being perpetuated to ensure the continuation of the power structure.

## Operating system of the universe

Science is the attempt to crack the program that runs the universe by reverse-engineering it. Instead of trying to understand and asking what the mind behind this program wants with us; instead of trying&mdash;as the mystics through the ages have&mdash;to communicate with It, asking It for guidance and direction, we are planning a mutiny. Because we, as a human race have not succeeded, we now believe that the captain has abandoned ship and that our only option is to replace the captain with one of our own. A serious mistake, if you ask me, full of the sin of arrogance.

## Reality overlay

What if the reality we are experiencing is just a human/virtual overlay of control, not Divinely ordained? (In fact, I think it is an arrogant assumption that we could ever measure up to the Infinite Power that controls and rules and nourishes this universe, without whose mercy we would not be here.)

> Anything that materialises in the reality of the ego has to first pass through veil of the ego.

It has to be self-identifiable, to have some primal idea of “beingness”, of existence within and of existence without. [Here the 3 shapes formed by the triangle...](/posts/qkab/trinity/) In other words there is some inner resonance or image of the what that is perceived externally. And the beloved ego is like a security system that we have to pass through to find the gold hidden in ground of your being. Thus the need to go beyond ego, to seek the actual source, or root, of this that I am, [the beginning/starting point](/posts/qkab/in_the_beginning/), where the source/realm from/with which it emerged, is most clearly present.

By the 4th generation, most traces of the source of an event have been lost. Thereupon the rise of symbols and archetypes, representations, reminders of the source and any transmission thereof will thereupon be encoded using symbols that are meant to represent the real thing itself. Only those who have had an experience of the Reality that these symbols are representing can ever understand what they are saying or expressing.

The whole of creation is like a coded message for those who can read the code. An athiest is then one who cannot, often, does not want to, believe in the code and thus, of course, will conclude that there is no code, and thus no “mind” behind that non-existent code – even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
