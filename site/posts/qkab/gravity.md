> Gravity is the breath of God that I breath in order to live

GRAVITY is the expression of the dark energy, the void that holds all of creation. It is not an internal force. It does not come from “mass” (which is the energy) of the object. It is the way the (energetic) “mass” interacts with this dark energy. In fact, mass is the name we give to the gravitational energy of the object itself.

It is this energy that keeps everything “moving”. For if we removed gravity and retained all other energies, what would we have? What would the world, our universe look like? It is very likely that there would be no interactions &mdash; or no “meaningful” ones.

To understand this we need to take a journey into infinity.[^5] Talk about synchronicities! I have just been talking about the singularity, the point where the opposing points co-exist, the singularity from which the duality emerges &mdash; thus eventually attaining the sufficient complexity through for the requirement of continuity &mdash; to proceed.

  <blockquote>
  In mathematics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere">the Riemann sphere</a>, named after Bernhard Riemann, is a model of the extended complex plane: the complex plane plus one point at infinity. This extended plane represents the extended complex numbers, that is, the complex numbers plus a value &#8734; for infinity. With the Riemann model, the point &#8734; is near to very large numbers, just as the point 0 is near to very small numbers. <br />

## What is infinity - Exercise 1

- Let us make an infinite line.
- But first we need to have a starting point.
- Start at a pt. (axiom of choice)
- Instead of a goal,
- Instead of a imagining something else (GRAVITY), some other place.
- Remember the starting point, ø, zero, the origin.
- Stay at that point
- hold it
- begin to imagine this point moving – while “holding” on to the starting point
