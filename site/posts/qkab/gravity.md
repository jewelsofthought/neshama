> Gravity is the breath of God that I breath in order to live

GRAVITY is the expression of the dark energy, the void that holds all of creation. It is not an internal force. It does not come from "mass" (which is the energy) of the object. It is the way the (energetic) "mass" interacts with this dark energy. In fact, mass is the name we give to the gravitational energy of the object itself.

It is this energy that keeps everything "moving". For if we removed gravity and retained all other energies, what would we have? What would the world, our universe look like? It is very likely that there would be no interactions &mdash; or no "meaningful" ones.

To understand this we need to take a journey into infinity.through the singularity, the point where the opposing points co-exist, the singularity from which the duality emerges &mdash; eventually attaining sufficient complexity for the requirement of continuity to proceed.

  In mathematics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere">the Riemann sphere</a>, named after Bernhard Riemann, is a model of the extended complex plane: the complex plane plus one point at infinity. This extended plane represents the extended complex numbers, that is, the complex numbers plus a value &#8734; for infinity. With the Riemann model, the point &#8734; is near to very large numbers, just as the point 0 is near to very small numbers. <br />
