## Consciousness of the Event

When we speak of the "Consciousness of the Event", we are referring to our ability to perceive, to become aware of, an event in our 3D material reality. Our perception is always based on our openness and ability to receive the event, whatever it may be. For in order to perceive any reality, it must pass through our senses and be "registered" by our mind, and it is there that we can and do affect our perception of the event. This is illustrated in the varied testimonies given by eye-witness of events.

By changing one letter, we find that receive could be "re-sieve", implying that any reception entails filtering, and only that which passes through the filter, collapses into an actual 3D event.

Let's propose we have a 4D-event. Through light passing through the 4D-object, one can project a 3D-object – or rather produce a projection of that 4D-object in 3D. Potentially an infinite amount of 3D-spheres can be produced by a rays of light passing through the 4D-sphere and projecting its "shadow" into 3D.

One could take the opposite view, and say that, as perceived by an entity that can only perceive 3 of its 4 dimensions, a constrainted, or partial, piece of the 4D-object will be "seen" or perceived by the 3D-observer.

One of the ancient expressions of this was through the concept of meta- or arch-angels. These are single angels that seem to have affected and been in the consciousness of many people. How could an angel affect and be in the consciousness of many people at the same time? How can they serve so many simultaneously? Perhaps the angel is a 4D-being that is capable of projecting a slew of 3D-spheres—events in 3D—that will be felt by many.

He is a 4D-being and can thus manipulate the object in 4D. He can, thus, control its appearance in 3D by moving the 4D-object and controlling the light that is projecting its energy into 3D. Thus it is through these rays of light ([זוהר = קרן אור]{dir="rtl"}) that he is able to keep track, these rays are the connection.

- Each ray will contain information, being of light, and thus will enlighten what needs to be manifest. It is the blueprint of what will emerge in 3D.
- Without this ray of light projecting the image, it would immediately disappear.
- Thus there is a form of communication occurring from the 4D-object to its 3D projection.
- If, in addition, there is a change in this projection, if there is a history expressed by some pattern, some state of order that differentiates itself from the Oneness, and there is some entity in 3D that is consciously recording these changes, some memory, a narrative that is being noted, then we have a scenario of what is actually occurring.
- For, although the ray itself contains information and that is expressed by the image that emerges, if these images are changing according to some order, then that change itself is information for the entities recording them in their consciousness.

Think of it as destiny.

What if you walk a different path? Will he change and update his rays of light to suit your way, or will he wait for you to return to the projected path, and then, once again, you will feel the light? Is that what darkness then is, that time you spend out of the range of your journey-projection?

If we continue with the above description then it seems that there is a guardian angel that each one of us is born with. Some call it your daemon – the one that knows your true soul purpose. We [Kabbalists] would call it as Neshama, your highest soul, the repository of your true soul destiny.

Thus the actual projections are then manipulated by your daemon. Think of it like a spotlight on a stage, lighting up a specific role. While you are in that role, the spotlight is on you. If you change your role, then you stand outside the spotlight.

You have an area, a neighbourhood, which is yours. If you wander too far out of your neighbourhood, who knows what might happen? This works in the same way. Each of us has the option to do what we wish with what we have been given, but if we do those things that are aligned with our soul purpose we will feel like we are in the light—but if not…
