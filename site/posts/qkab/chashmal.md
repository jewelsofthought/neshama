## Chashmal/Electricity

> Electricity has opened the portal to the next stage of humanity's evolution.

What if we look at _chashmal_ as the full electro-magnetic spectrum and beyond?

## Water

> Water as communication medium. So is Chashmal!

All was fine, until we encountered electricity (_chashmal_). This was something we could only experience. We could not perceive it with any of our 5 senses. It was tremendously useful, and people were dying in their desire and need for its benefits and use. We did not hesitate at the door to this discovery, but rushed madly in - as if it was a new discovery of gold or diamonds - and began using this limitless font of energy we had discovered to benefit "all" [which as per usual, meant first those who could afford, or were lucky enough to be born into, access to it].

No one thought to stop and the doorway and ask "What is it?". Because we were still in the trance of the certainty of empirical measurements - as many still are. It is an essentially 2d comprehension of the world around us, rather like the behemoth. And so we rushed in, where angels might fear to tread.

So onward intrepid explorers, armed with your electrically powered machines, and let us see what we can do... Well, we live in the [outcome](intention.html). I am old, but, if you are young, you have to live with outcome of your ancestors creations.

## Shabbat (Judaism)

What if the decision to associate _chashmal_ with fire, and impose all the same criterion to its usage as was associated with fire in the religion?

Even if that was the true prophetic insight, perhaps it is not an "equals", but an "equivalent" and there are some places where it fits exactly, and some that it doesn't - even some that we haven't even thought of, or perceived yet. We were not aware of a lot of the following implications of this new force that followed the writ.

And, in this time of lockdown, this decision is being tested. Just as the decisions that were made regarding _kashrut_ were made in a time where certain context that have emerged were not yet present. At each step of evolution of the Jewish cultures and traditions, we have stepped forward into them, and, even though there might have been dissension in the ranks, eventually stepped forward into the new revolution.

For instance, one man, Isaac Luria, the Ari, changed the course of Jewish evolution. Another Isaac..., not even an ordained rabbi, significantly influenced the way we conducted our affairs. Rambam, Maimonides, influenced many generations of Jews with his _Mishna Torah_. We had certain traditions that were clearly laid out during the temple era, which are no longer practised, and have, for the most part, been replaced by others.

There are two major areas that need to take into account what is happening in the world around us, and not to bury our heads in the sand, saying "God will save us". [Story of Adam and Eve](adam_eve.html)

The first is _kashrut_. The second is electricity.

Let us begin with the latter. If we can no longer gather and take our services together, the best we have at this stage is to do it virtually. What if we recorded a shabbat service, and the screen automagically went on (ala _shaon shabbat_) and we could watch and participate in the service in one's own home.

If we were allowed, we could even carry on the service together (ala _One Giant Leap_). This is the kind of collaboration we need. We cannot be held by these constraints that were interpreted by a bygone age. Just as the original tablets could be read by anyone in their mother tongue, so He would want us to see it through eyes that are true to the Beholder, and not trying to see what others see. If the intention is not to use it for spiritual upliftment, then it is not sanctioned. Remember, the truth is known to the One.

## Energy is energy - good or bad

Energy is energy, whether good or bad, positive or negative, replenishing or diminishing.

_Chashmal_, electricity, as fire, is both and bad. To the universe, there is no difference – though to God there might be. Thus both are equal in the universal scheme of things – though the outcomes might be different.

Perhaps it is a rallying call, a guiding beacon calling us, challenging us to “manifest” the upper in the lower, and thus transform the lower.

## Zero Waste (Energy)

If the synergy is perfectly in sync, then there is **zero waste**, as all inputs will be used and all outputs nourish something in the chain of life [differentiate between local & global in/outputs] (like the [Oroborus](oroborus.html)). Similar to the _manna_ given to the Son of Israel while they were wandering in the desert - which produced no waste as it was spiritual food.
