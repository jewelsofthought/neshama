It is said that Wisdom is the ability to understand the essence, the principles, the “fundamentals” of a topic, and then are able to apply this understanding of principles to other initiatives. Perhaps one could then refer to mathematics as a language of wisdom, and equations as the sentences with which it speaks, the symbols beings vowels that bring the consonants to life.
