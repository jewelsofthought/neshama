## Living beings

**Every sensation you feel, every thought you are conscious of, every heartbeat is an expression of the energy that permeates - nay, Is - the entire existence.**

Are we essentially planar beings, living in a 3d space, like vegetation and animals who perceive mainly 2d (with a little depth)&mdash;like a slice of 3d?

Living speaks of a certain fluidity, an ongoing dynamic of a certain nature. With inanimate objects, this "life", this growth is not fluid, but occurs in more discrete steps; plus its growth only affects the object peripherally - perhaps to stabilise its containment.

Living beings also embody an inner consciousness that is expressed in their lives and how we live it.

There is a localised consciousness/will that drives this inanimate object and is a part of their life force i.e. their (involuntary) drive to live. Only humans or imprisoned animals will try to take their own lives.

Thus it is not essentially a planar being, but will just be an objective expression of this life force in whatever dimension it emanates in.

### 1d beings

What if we acknowledge the existence of 1d entities - who were never seen, only whose presence was able to be detected. In fact, though we might claim to "see" them, it is only through sensitive instruments specially crafted that we are able to "sense" them. There are many stories of their influence, but nothing is certain. They would be the minute particles that surround us and influence us at every turn. We call them things like quarks, when they are mere hints, forces from another place. They are called atoms, which cluster in crystalline forms we call molecules, when elemental. But they are also the virii and bacteria that surround us, and both feed us and feed of us, part of the living matrix that enables life to exist.

### 2d beings

We need to include the insects in this batch. Imagine a 2d encountering a 3d. All it would see are the bottom of your boots - from the side. In fact, if you take a step, it will be almost magic to him, for your boot will dissapear - if he is lucky, he will have a glimpse of the sole of your boot, and then reappear somewhere else, probably a decent distance away for him. But for you, it was just a step. Your voice will come from the "heavens" (G-d knows where that is!) - but somewhere "above" him - if he even has the concept of above, otherwise he will perceive it all around him. You kindly kneel down to show him yourself, but this weird visage, something he could never recognise, let alone describe will suddenly appear close to him, perhaps as large as a mountain. As he has no depth perception or, for the sake of our story, very limited ability, he will only see a partial image of your visage. Something like those sculptures of a face emerging from a rock. I do not think it will assuage his terror at your appearance.

They are essentially a 2d life form in a 3d space, unaware of the 3d space in which it exists, just as a fish is unaware of the water in which it lives&mdash;until that moment that it is ripped from it by an external force, the fisherman. Thus only by being removed from its natural existence, thus dying, is it able perceive the water which in which it lived.

Perhaps certain humans experience something similar when dying. If G-d created the ocean of existence, then only upon being removed from that ocean are we suddenly able to understand that we are just like a fish in G-d's ocean.

All living things are aware that they are alive&mdashand I would include vegeation in that. Animals and vegetation are planar because their vector of movement is planar.

For instance, one might think of a tree as a 3D composition, but its thrust, its dynamic, i.e. its mode of growth, is 2D. For it is essentially linear, with its convolutions being due to environmental and other constraints. And it is only because we are have 3d perception (which we might have gained at some point), that it is obvious to us that the tree grows, the bird flies, and the dolphin swims in a 3d space. However, one can exist in a 3d space, and only move in a 2d fashion.

For a branch grows in essentially a straight line, a vector that has a "goal"/direction, and is shaped by environmental influences, emerging not quite as straight as it was intended to be.

Similarly an animal, running on the earth lives essentially on the plane. One sees it with a deer trying to escape from a lion. Most of its evasive manoeuvres are angular - unless the need arises to go around something.

Birds & fish experience in 2D but have an extra dimension of movement. In other words they can experience the 3 axes but only as 2D planes. One can see it in the evasive manoeuvres of the bird being hunted by another. but still relate to it as planar.

There might be, very possibly, certain of the mammalian fish that are aware of the 3d space in which they play.

Similarly, we move essentially in a 2d, planar space, just as do the other animals. But we are (or have become) aware of the 3d space of our actual existence. Because we have been granted an "soul", an awareness of the unreal aspects of existence, there are those amongst us who can even perceive the 4d space in which we live. But only a small group of human beings seem to be capable of this. Some are scientists, and some are philosopher; some are priests and some are shamans. They will all have a spiritual awareness, though they might not all call it that.

### 3d beings

To the 3d's you are like an ant, or worse, he might not even be able to perceive you, as he has limited 2d perception - though I propose his consciousness is 2d, though the reality that he live in is 3d. He needs to be trained to live from a 3d perspective and is not necessarily more effective than a 2d entity.

### 4d beings

Then above 3d, we encounter, or are "under" 4d, something we can only intuit, but not perceive - as we do not have 4d consciousness. But you have to remember something about consciousness - it is like a wave, and thus is an expression of energy, and energy is infinite in expression. That is, it can and will express itself anywhere. In other words, it will find and outlet, using whatever material is available to express itself. The only manifestation will be like the "waves on the ocean", soundless but full of sensation/feeling.

## 4th dimensional being

As a 4<sup>th</sup> dimensional being, you are constantly aware of each one of these realms of interaction - from 4<sup>th</sup> to 1<sup>st</sup> (and even 5<sup>th</sup>).

Imagine each moment of interaction (action -> reaction) as a supernova that spews out material as it bursts into light. A light so bright that it traverses infinity.

From my, the individual, point of view, it looks something like this:

<blockquote class="poem">
From the depth of my being rises the impulse. With enough power and faith, it bursts forth and engages the other. At that tangential moment/pt of contact, the “shock wave” spreads out in all directions, proportional to the impact/power of the interaction.<br />
It could be fleeting; it could be life changing.

## 3d designs for 4d systems

By using 3d designs to build 4d structures, we are only perpetuating the 4d paradigm we are presently struggling with. We have to being to perceive our existence and what is happening and why from a 4d perspective, using 3d structures, in order to untangle the mess we currently find ourselves in.

One could view 4d as movement in 3d. In fact, it is through this very movement/change of 3d objects, that have enabled us to discover and describe the 4d version of said 3d object. Only through some movement, some change of state in 3d, that we could not describe using our 3d mathematical tools, could we even become aware of the possibility of the existence of such a 4d version. This led to more accurate (4d) descriptions (of the 3d empirical experience of matter). We describe the 4d objects as a composite of what we know&mdash;3d objects&mdash;just as a 2d description may form a composite of 3d form.

Although a 2d perspective is highly effective in a 3d environment, it is limited, and predictable, and thus can be easily controlled from a 3d perspective. So it is regarding one who has a 4d perspective on our 3d existence.

Up till now, we have presented this 4d landscape in religious, mythological and sociological terms, emphasising the qualities of love, kindness, humility, gentleness, etc. Though it includes pride, greed, lust, desire, etc. too. One could describe this as the 4d aspect of human beings, an unpredictable indescribable experience that that can have huge effect on our lives. Even among the aspects of 4d that we do know or recognise, they all “suffer” from unpredictable, yet known, behaviour. That is, although we know how it behaves, we cannot say what it will do at any moment with any certainty, until it has already done it (made its choice – so as to say).

---

We have managed to overcome much of what has threatened us in the past. I believe many of the ills that we suffer from now, at this point of human evolution, are caused by humans... us. // We are our own worst enemy. We say that on an individual basis, and, it seems, as regarding the present crises we are facing. \\ We are supposed to be an intelligent species – and we are. But if this is the best we can do, then it seems that some beastly, self-destructive urge is what has driven us to this evolutionary point.
My message it for us to enter the timeless zone of 4d prepared, because judging from what is unfolding, we are passing through into this amazing place, full of incredible surprises and amazing gifts. But let us not charge blindly into the space that angels fear to tread.

## Shamans & Mystics (& Mekubalim)

Shamans and mystics, those intrepid explorers of the other realms, have indeed encountered this space in the earliest of days. How they did, we do not know. But there are many records of such journeys and dealings with this realm from all over the world.

In a time when the only language one could use to describe these realms was story and myth, we used archetypes and symbols that would awaken the unconscious mind, from mandalas to myth. However, we do have another language today to describe that space, although it is like the prince that will not take his place on the throne, denying all connection to his family – and that is the language of mathematics.

Science suffers from all the ills of any living religion. From the fanatics to the liberals, and all the various levels of interpretations of its texts, often by those who do not understand the original language it was written in.
So let us enter into the magical realm of 4d and work together to live in a future that is not decreed and driven by this 3d chaos, but embraces where life is leading us, and gather to ensure a future for being human.

## Multi-dimensionality of the Human experience.

What if all these entities, our guardian angels, ego, consciousness and many other such associated beings are, in fact, expressions of the multidimensionality of your being. Take, for instance, your Guardian Angel, or even your Daemon. The question is, what would multi-dimensional consciousness actually look/feel like?

The Kabbalah Tree is, in essence, an expression of this multi-dimensionality that we are becoming aware of.
-- R’ Y”mba

## Characteristics of Dimensions

1. Every dimension contains within it every lower dimension.
2. There are an infinite amount of projections of any higher dimensional object onto a lower dimension.
3. The basic “reality” that is experienced in any dimension is the point of interaction, what we often call the “here and now”, a singularity&mdash;the (present) moment.
4. Every object/event is made up of a set of points.

Q: Is a higher dimensional point equivalent to a lower dimensional point?

Each point can be represented exactly in every dimension. (As it goes up it would increase in dimensionality, but still be a point - albeit an _n_ dimensional one.
But a point has “emptiness” in it, that can get filled, and so it would remain where it was, perhaps made more dense by all the energy from the upper dimension that has now been collected at that point. This is an interesting way of looking at the density of our dimensions. As one descends, it becomes more and more dense.

5. The point is invariant, irrespective of dimension.

It just takes more variables, more reference information, to locate the point in higher dimensions.

6. Every N dimensional space has a N+1 brane or skin that “encloses” it. A soccer ball, for example.

## Descriptions of Dimensions

### 1D

It is, a moment, an event. Generally represented by a circle. The only information is its position. It signifies the existence of something; its "first" emergence, or manifestation thereof. The point, or tangent of something.

But that brings us to immediately recognise that if there is 1, a something, there has to be something "else", even if that other is the NOT of the previous. More often, in order for there to be any continuation, any recognition, there has to be at least one other. Basically there cannot be 1 that emerges without their being at least 2&mdash;the 1 that emerged and the whatever it emerged from!

### 2D

Represents a this and a that; an other appears, thus there is an awareness of self because of existence of other.
Now we have length & breadth but no depth

### 3D

This could be indicative of a relation between two (at least). It introduces the aspect of depth, thus perspective. Also of reproduction&mdash;out of the two comes the one.

### 4D

Represented from our 3D space as the imaginary number. Which has a different space/time continuum. It manifests as effects in our space. Also known as the angelic realm, also the imaginary realm.

In relation to 3D, would be able to “see" and pass through walls. Just as a 4d mage could “see the future”, similar to "passing through walls".

A being, or consciousness, fully embodied in a dimension, is very effective within it. One finds man different examples of this. Someone who ignores or denies their 4d consciousness (what the Kabbalists call their _neshama_), will be incredibly efficient in the 3d. One who embraces, and focuses, only on the elements of his 2d existence – separating the world into recognisable/unrecognisable, useful/useless, good or bad will be horribly efficient in the short term, but woeful in the long term.

### 4 worlds

The 4 worlds of the Kabbalah, with also the 4 levels of interpretation of the writings, could be interpreted as dimensions, expressed in other terms.

The 4 levels of "worlds" in the multi-world theory.

## Summary

1 -> pt
2 -> line - relationship between 2 points in space
3 -> plane/field - encompassing the 2 original points, and their relationship, thus producing shapes. Is the place where the points replicate/reproduce. This is the expression of the points connecting with other already existing elements.

## Human

> We are living in 3d space with 4d consciousness, moving along a 2d vector. But are descended from some 5d+ super-consciousness, or root soul.

We are 4d (consciousness) beings having a 3d (real/mundane) experience. Or having an experience of living in a 3d reality.  
Thus there is something always missing, something that we are always seeking, and the only way we can find it is by accepting the 4d consciousness that we are capable of accessing.

Animals for instance; amoral people; those that live in a world of polarities, of right and wrong, good and evil. If one takes all you have to calculate for 3 dimensions into account, while another is only working in 2, the latter will be able to arrive at a decision sooner, as it can even implement it more swiftly, while you are hamstrung by the extra dimension you are taking into account. However, he is hampered by the inaccurate assessment that will haunt him all through his actions. This is due to propagation of error, which, as an approximation of the reality of the event, will be inevitable.

### Interactions

It is the difference between the one who says, “This is in my way. If I push all else aside, I can continue”, verses the other that considers the effect upon the one being pushed aside. And thus does not deal with the situation in the most efficient way in the moment, but could fumble at the critical point.

## Gears

A 4th to 3rd dimensional down-shift is like gearing down from 4th gear to 3rd gear. 3rd is a "denser" gear, providing more power and torque, but restricting the speed and distance that you can achieve in that gear. So it is with our consciousness. Most of us have not been taught and have to learn on the road how to use one's "gears". We exist in our bodies much like we behave with our cars. We expect it to work when we want to use it, and if something goes wrong, we take it to the mechanic (doctor) to fix it for us, and feel we need to know next to nothing about the running and maintenance of our bodies.

But even more intense would be to think of us as a 4th dimension being living in 3d.

## Dimensional axioms

<blockquote dir="rtl">
יענך יהוה ביום ישלח עזרך מקדש
</blockquote>

Underlying everything are the broad strokes, the “axioms”, the philosophic agreements, physical laws, etc. These are so subtle, that only gifted individuals can comprehend them and of those only the destined become anointed.

In each world there are core principles. Each one has its own "physics" and aspect of time.

# Point of reality

Everything that actually "happens", occurs at the point of contact. Or, to be more specific, in the local area of “contact”, the meeting, or conjugal point.

If a 2d object interacts with a 4d object, although this interaction might affect that 4d object in all 4 of its dimension, the 2d object would only be aware of the 2d interaction. If that contact is 2d, it is a 2d point of contact, and will only affect "half" of the 4d object/event.

But for any point (whatever its dimension) to manifest, there must be a simple, powerful hadronic type of force that causes a moment of “recognition”, of manifestation/form&mdash;which could be referred to as an essential 1 (or 0) dimensional interaction, a truly spiritual moment. A moment which is not yet formed in the space/perception of the multidimensional being that it is occurring to. This moment will be one which has nothing but position (and intent/will). Although, if it is mature enough, it may perhaps have both shape and energy–but that information has not yet been arrived! In some strange way, whatever the dimension, the only interaction really occurs at the actual point of contact.

Perhaps Hadronic energy is truly 1d energy and that is why it is so immensely powerful. It “holds” these energies for long enough for them to manifest as something that is perceivable.
