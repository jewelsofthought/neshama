## Living beings

**Every sensation you feel, every thought you are conscious of, every heartbeat is an expression of the energy that permeates - nay, Is - the entire existence.**

Are we essentially planar beings, living in a 3d space, like vegetation and animals who perceive mainly 2d (with a little depth)&mdash;like a slice of 3d?

Living speaks of a certain fluidity, an ongoing dynamic of a certain nature. With inanimate objects, this "life", this growth is not fluid, but occurs in more discrete steps; plus its growth only affects the object peripherally - perhaps to stabilise its containment.

Living beings also embody an inner consciousness that is expressed in their lives and how we live it.

There is a localised consciousness/will that drives this inanimate object and is a part of their life force i.e. their (involuntary) drive to live. Only humans or imprisoned animals will try to take their own lives.

Thus it is not essentially a planar being, but will just be an objective expression of this life force in whatever dimension it emanates in.

### 1d beings

What if we acknowledge the existence of 1d entities - who were never seen, only whose presence was able to be detected. In fact, though we might claim to "see" them, it is only through sensitive instruments specially crafted that we are able to "sense" them. There are many stories of their influence, but nothing is certain. They would be the minute particles that surround us and influence us at every turn. We call them things like quarks, when they are mere hints, forces from another place. They are called atoms, which cluster in crystalline forms we call molecules, when elemental. But they are also the virii and bacteria that surround us, and both feed us and feed of us, part of the living matrix that enables life to exist.

### 2d beings

We need to include the insects in this batch. Imagine a 2d encountering a 3d. All it would see are the bottom of your boots - from the side. In fact, if you take a step, it will be almost magic to him, for your boot will dissapear - if he is lucky, he will have a glimpse of the sole of your boot, and then reappear somewhere else, probably a decent distance away for him. But for you, it was just a step. Your voice will come from the "heavens" (G-d knows where that is!) - but somewhere "above" him - if he even has the concept of above, otherwise he will perceive it all around him. You kindly kneel down to show him yourself, but this weird visage, something he could never recognise, let alone describe will suddenly appear close to him, perhaps as large as a mountain. As he has no depth perception or, for the sake of our story, very limited ability, he will only see a partial image of your visage. Something like those sculptures of a face emerging from a rock. I do not think it will assuage his terror at your appearance.

They are essentially a 2d life form in a 3d space, unaware of the 3d space in which it exists, just as a fish is unaware of the water in which it lives&mdash;until that moment that it is ripped from it by an external force, the fisherman. Thus only by being removed from its natural existence, thus dying, is it able perceive the water which in which it lived.

Perhaps certain humans experience something similar when dying. If G-d created the ocean of existence, then only upon being removed from that ocean are we suddenly able to understand that we are just like a fish in G-d's ocean.

All living things are aware that they are alive&mdashand I would include vegeation in that. Animals and vegetation are planar because their vector of movement is planar.

For instance, one might think of a tree as a 3D composition, but its thrust, its dynamic, i.e. its mode of growth, is 2D. For it is essentially linear, with its convolutions being due to environmental and other constraints. And it is only because we are have 3d perception (which we might have gained at some point), that it is obvious to us that the tree grows, the bird flies, and the dolphin swims in a 3d space. However, one can exist in a 3d space, and only move in a 2d fashion.

For a branch grows in essentially a straight line, a vector that has a "goal"/direction, and is shaped by environmental influences, emerging not quite as straight as it was intended to be.

Similarly an animal, running on the earth lives essentially on the plane. One sees it with a deer trying to escape from a lion. Most of its evasive manoeuvres are angular - unless the need arises to go around something.

Birds & fish experience in 2D but have an extra dimension of movement. In other words they can experience the 3 axes but only as 2D planes. One can see it in the evasive manoeuvres of the bird being hunted by another. but still relate to it as planar.

There might be, very possibly, certain of the mammalian fish that are aware of the 3d space in which they play.

Similarly, we move essentially in a 2d, planar space, just as do the other animals. But we are (or have become) aware of the 3d space of our actual existence. Because we have been granted an "soul", an awareness of the unreal aspects of existence, there are those amongst us who can even perceive the 4d space in which we live. But only a small group of human beings seem to be capable of this. Some are scientists, and some are philosopher; some are priests and some are shamans. They will all have a spiritual awareness, though they might not all call it that.

### 3d beings

To the 3d's you are like an ant, or worse, he might not even be able to perceive you, as he has limited 2d perception - though I propose his consciousness is 2d, though the reality that he live in is 3d. He needs to be trained to live from a 3d perspective and is not necessarily more effective than a 2d entity.

### 4d beings

Then above 3d, we encounter, or are "under" 4d, something we can only intuit, but not perceive - as we do not have 4d consciousness. But you have to remember something about consciousness - it is like a wave, and thus is an expression of energy, and energy is infinite in expression. That is, it can and will express itself anywhere. In other words, it will find and outlet, using whatever material is available to express itself. The only manifestation will be like the "waves on the ocean", soundless but full of sensation/feeling.

## 4th dimensional being

As a 4<sup>th</sup> dimensional being, you are constantly aware of each one of these realms of interaction - from 4<sup>th</sup> to 1<sup>st</sup> (and even 5<sup>th</sup>).

Imagine each moment of interaction (action -> reaction) as a supernova that spews out material as it bursts into light. A light so bright that it traverses infinity.

From that vantage point, it looks something like this:

> _From the depth of my being rises the impulse. With enough power and faith, it bursts forth and engages the other. At that tangential moment/pt of contact, the “shock wave” spreads out in all directions, proportional to the impact/power of the interaction._ > _It could be fleeting; it could be life changing._

## 3d designs for 4d systems

By using 3d designs to build 4d structures, we are only perpetuating the 4d paradigm we are presently struggling with. We have to being to perceive our existence and what is happening and why from a 4d perspective, using 3d structures, in order to untangle the mess we currently find ourselves in.

One could view 4d as movement in 3d. In fact, it is through this very movement/change of 3d objects, that have enabled us to discover and describe the 4d version of said 3d object. Only through some movement, some change of state in 3d, that we could not describe using our 3d mathematical tools, could we even become aware of the possibility of the existence of such a 4d version. This led to more accurate (4d) descriptions (of the 3d empirical experience of matter). We describe the 4d objects as a composite of what we know&mdash;3d objects&mdash;just as a 2d description may form a composite of 3d form.

Although a 2d perspective is highly effective in a 3d environment, it is limited, and predictable, and thus can be easily controlled from a 3d perspective. So it is regarding one who has a 4d perspective on our 3d existence.

Up till now, we have presented this 4d landscape in religious, mythological and sociological terms, emphasising the qualities of love, kindness, humility, gentleness, etc. Though it includes pride, greed, lust, desire, etc. too. One could describe this as the 4d aspect of human beings, an unpredictable indescribable experience that that can have huge effect on our lives. Even among the aspects of 4d that we do know or recognise, they all “suffer” from unpredictable, yet known, behaviour. That is, although we know how it behaves, we cannot say what it will do at any moment with any certainty, until it has already done it (made its choice – so as to say).

We have managed to overcome much of what has threatened us in the past. I believe many of the ills that we suffer from now, at this point of human evolution, are caused by humans... us. // We are our own worst enemy. We say that on an individual basis, and, it seems, as regarding the present crises we are facing. \\ We are supposed to be an intelligent species – and we are. But if this is the best we can do, then it seems that some beastly, self-destructive urge is what has driven us to this evolutionary point.
My message it for us to enter the timeless zone of 4d prepared, because judging from what is unfolding, we are passing through into this amazing place, full of incredible surprises and amazing gifts. But let us not charge blindly into the space that angels fear to tread.

## Shamans & Mystics (& Mekubalim)

Shamans and mystics, those intrepid explorers of the other realms, have indeed encountered this space in the earliest of days. How they did, we do not know. But there are many records of such journeys and dealings with this realm from all over the world.

In a time when the only language one could use to describe these realms was story and myth, we used archetypes and symbols that would awaken the unconscious mind, from mandalas to myth. However, we do have another language today to describe that space, although it is like the prince that will not take his place on the throne, denying all connection to his family – and that is the language of mathematics.

Science suffers from all the ills of any living religion. From the fanatics to the liberals, and all the various levels of interpretations of its texts, often by those who do not understand the original language it was written in.
So let us enter into the magical realm of 4d and work together to live in a future that is not decreed and driven by this 3d chaos, but embraces where life is leading us, and gather to ensure a future for being human.
