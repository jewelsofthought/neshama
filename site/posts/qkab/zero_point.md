## "I am that I am"

Only the Divine, Great Spirit can be represented by the statement "_I am that I am_".

In a sense, it represents the trivial statement, the one of identity, represented by $$1 = 1$$.

However, the truth behind it is this: $$I$$ am the only $$I$$ that is fully $$I$$. In other words $$I$$ am the only $$I$$ that fulfils $$I = I$$. This is known as the "enlightened" one, a fully self-realised person. Any one else is $$i < I$$, incomplete, not fully realised, still in flux.

[To represent the Rav's concept of _benoni_ mathematically, one could propose that 0 is the wicked person, and 1 is the full-realised, righteous person. Also remembering that nothing can be 0, so that even the completely wicked one is not zero, but at least a small amount greater than 0. However, that could be represented as $$0 < i < 1$$]

## Everything exists between 0 & 1.

How can I say that?

Start from 1. Is that really the beginning? Our narrative can only begin with the existence of something – at minimum 1.
The paradoxical nature of this statement is that actually, in order for there to be any narrative, we need 2 – the binary, the duality, this and that. 1 is insufficient as there is nothing to know of the existence of the singularity, if that is all that there is. One could refer to it as a closed loop. Selfish, self-centred and narcissistic. Thus in order for anything to “exist”, there needs to be 2 – itself and the other, the other that can relate or receive the narrative, the one we call the “witness”.

The accepted wisdom was that everything arose from the One, and everything is reducible to the One. Oneness, which is, was and always will be the Source of Everything. It was our brothers from the Ancient Middle East who alerted us to the existence of a state before the One. A place from which the ‘I’ had not yet emerged. They called it naught, Ø, the empty set – a place where even the one does not exist. This upset the monotheistic religions, who had battled the many, reducing it to the primal One, until we accepted the incorporeal into our language.

## Zero & One

Starting with only a zero (0) or a (1), all fractionalisation occurs upon encountering the densities of our manifest existence.

From zero nothing emanates. It is the only point that is not a point. Once one emerges, then all other "numbers" can emanate from the one. But only nothing emanates from nothing. So how did something emerge from nothing? That is the deepest mystery of all.

Regarding our conscious awareness, we start of as 1, aware only of the I and it's needs. Purely egotistical and trying to survive in a hostile environment. Selfish, youthful, unaware, we awaken to an other, and now are entering 2d. We move from the beautiful innocence of I to the awareness of the duality. From the simple - it is what it is - to seeing the reflection in the illusion, encountering the unreality of some deeply held beliefs until there is a deep splintering of inner and outer. It is here our true journey begins. We have just passed through the first gate and reached the outer temple courtyard. We have entered the exploration of duality.

- 3rd - child, something born, another enters.
- 4th - realising it is all in your imagination!

## Definitions

Before I continue, let me set the field. There are certain constraints within which I make that statement, which will become apparent. There even might be an exception to this rule that someone may think of. Thus, I will say that this statement is correct, with a negligible margin of error.

Mathematically speaking, there is a one-to-one correspondence between all the real numbers between 0 &amp; 1, and all the integers. In other words for every whole number there is a corresponding number less than one, and greater than zero.

So, between 0 & 1 there is an infinity of numbers, that can be mapped to all whole nubmers that "exist".

## Atom of Existence

However, rather than launch into a rigorous rationalisation of this idea, I would like to present it rather as a story of an unfolding. A story starting with the awareness of being aware&mdash;something which I like to refer to as "The Axiom of Existence". All I know, without a doubt, is that I aware of being alive. With this awareness comes the awareness of the state of not-being alive. Somehow, we have been granted the ability to perceive the future&mdash;that which is not but will be. In the presence of the certainty of life, we are simultaneously aware our future demise. Of nothing else are we certain&mdash;especially as regards the future.

This is why, instead of an axiom, I like to refer to this living conscious being, as the atom of (consciousn) existence.

$$I$$ exist.... $$I$$ am... me?. Let's identify this I as $$1$$... a single entity. However, do not become confused, I am not the One that is everything. I am only one number in the infinity of possible numbers&mdash;what is known as the set of numbers&mdash; that make up the Infinite One.

## The beginning

In the beginning though, I am not aware of the end nor that there is even an end.

I come into being not knowing where I came from. Some might say that we came from "nothing". (Though what that means in terms of their cosmology, I am unsure of.) Life as a single autonomous event&mdash;unconnected from anything else that occurred or had occurred. Others believe that we are G-d, blessed be His name, the First Principle, wanting to have a "human" experience. After we depart this world, a spark of life leaves my physical body, and for those who remain, I, as represented by my physical body, am no longer alive.

Was the "spark" of life something that "arose"&mdash;from nothing and nowhere&mdash;because of a certain combination of material that just happened to come together spontaneously - that is, according to "natural" laws? Or was it the result of something&mdash;like a particle or perhaps a wave&mdash;that emerges under certain, unknown, conditions?

We just do not know. Perhaps this "eternal life" that is spoken of, or dreamt of, is the one whereby we will know&mdash;and be able to transition, that is, relate to whatever it is we will learn in death, that we could not while alive. Through this experience of death, we become aware of the greater continuum of existence.

### In the end

A major step in consciousness is the realisation that I am going to die in the end which puts the I-story into a greater context. That is, although I live my life, something else&mdash;the same something that somehow enabled me to now awaken in this "place"&mdash;will at some unknown point, once again remove this particular awareness that I am now expressing (by writing this &ndash; for instance).

This I-ness is not yet an aware $$I$$. It is just conscious of its I-ness. For this $$i$$, its I-ness is a fact (or life, one could say). It takes many years (six or so, I believe), for the $$i$$' to become aware of its $$I$$. And it actually only becomes real, upon truly knowing another $$I$$&mdash;which will generally happen through love, if 1 lucky enough to experience it.

## The journey of the I

My story begins with the one $$i$$ am becoming. The only way to do that is to explore all the $$i$$'s that 'I am not'... yet. {NOTE: Perhaps that is the only progression to contemplate. That which brings the $$i$$ to fully experience its own $$I$$-ness. As is said, "The only person to strive to be better than, to be superior to, is your own previous self." } Now, one thing we know(s), is that there was a time when there was no-one. As far as this particular one was concerned, there was no other one, 'no-thing', at very least, no one. So one decided to give itself a name, and called itself Point. Thus this $$1$$ can be represented by a point.

Another way of looking at it, is that every shape has a positive version and a negative one. For instance the triangle has both an inner triangle, and an outer one. Why is this a positive and a negative? Well, if we think from the perspective of the triangle, then everything inside the triangle is part of triangle, and everything outside of triangle is out of triangle, like $$t+$$ and $$t-$$.

This other I, we give the concept of 0, or zero - nothingness. Before I existed, what was there? When I don't exist anymore, what is there? So, we signify the other as 0, and the I, the point of existence, as 1. And this point 0, we can also represent as a point, or rather as the non-point (or place).

Thus we have two points, 0 & 1, and the "line" or space/time between them. The gap that makes up our "consciousness"&mdash;for to realise that something has occurred after it has transpired&mdash;never before.

## Unpack

Start with number 1 (me, I). Think of it as a moment in "time" in which I (1) appear(s).

If 1 is aware, then there must have been a time when 1 was unaware, and as such, 1 did not exist, and that point we represent as 0. In fact, we can represent this death/extinction as 1 - 1 = 0.

The dash representing the life you lived, and then was extinguished again. This is a statement we are all familiar with. But if we break it down philosophically, it reads something like: If we remove (subtract) the 1 which has appeared, with another 1, then we will, in essence, have annihilated the 1st 1, and produced nothing, or emptiness, which is 0 &ndash;nothingness.

Let us work it through this way. The space we are working in, is that space in which each one is unique, on the one hand, and that there is no difference between any one&mdash;they are all alike. These two extremes define our space/line. To be practical, we start with the simple, knowing that it might not be correct, and work out everything with that foundation. That is fine when one deals things that can be empirically compared. For instance, 1m = 1m... no doubt about it. In this case, the one only speaks of quantity. But, when we enter into more undefined areas, this is very limiting. Does 1 dog = 1 dog... Well, only if it is the same dog. In other words, every one is different. Now, if we base all our data models on this principle, we would have to reduce it to the case where 1 dog = 1 dog, else we will not be able to use our mathematical modelling to come to conclusions, and thus "solutions" (to what? for what purpose .i.e, what problem are we solving?).

This even becomes more out of sync when it is referring to human beings. Then numbers become death dealers, reducing humanity to a common pool of value, to be traded and used, just like any item of value.
