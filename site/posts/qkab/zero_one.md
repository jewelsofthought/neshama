There is a 1-1 correspondence between any set and the real numbers between 0 & 1.

## "I am that I am"

Only the Divine, Great Spirit is expressed by "I am that I am".

In a sense, it represents the trivial statement, the one of identity, represented by $1 = 1$.

However, the truth behind it is this: I am the only I that is fully I. In other words I am the only I that fulfils $I = I$. Everything else is $< 1$, incomplete, not fully realised, still in flux.

## Everything exists between 0 & 1.

How can I say that?

Before I continue, let me set the field. There are certain constraints within which I make that statement, which will become apparent. There even might be an exception to this rule that someone may think of. Thus, I will say that this statement is correct, with a negligible margin of error.

## Atom of Existence

Rather than launch into a rigorous rationalisation of this idea, I would like to present it rather as a story of an unfolding. This story starts with an awareness of being aware, - something which I like to refer to as "The Axiom/Atom of Existence". All I know, without a doubt, is that I am alive, and aware. I exist.... I am... I am the 1. which we represent in our language, interesting enough as 'I'.

In the beginning I am not aware of the end, or that there is even an end. A major step in consciousness is the realisation that I am going to die - which puts the I-story into a greater context. That is, although I live my life, something else&mdash;the same something that somehow enabled me to now awaken in this "place"&mdash;will at some unknown point, once again remove this particular awareness that I am now expressing (by writing this &ndash; for instance).

This I-ness is not yet an aware $I$. It is just conscious of its I-ness. For this $i$, it's I-ness is a fact (or life, one could say). It takes many years (six or so, I believe), for the 'i' to become aware of its I. And it actually only becomes real, upon authentically encountering another I - which will generally happen through love, if 1 is lucky enough to experience it.[The journey of the I](I.html)

My story begins with the one I am becoming, in the all that 'I am not'. Now, one thing one know(s), is that there was a time when there was no-one. As far as one was concerned, there was no other one, 'no-thing', at very least, no one. So one decided to give itself a name, and called itself Point. So we say that this one can be represent ed by a point.

[excluded_middle](excluded_mid.html){This is also an expression of what is known as the principle of the excluded middle: if P then there exists a ~P. For everything that exists there is an equal and opposite, if only in potential. Or, with something everyone is familiar with: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction". This applies to energy, but I propose that it applies to everything - though not necessarily equal and opposite by our standards of measurement.}

Another way of looking at it, is that every shape has a positive version and a negative one. For instance the triangle has both an inner triangle, and an outer one. Why is this a positive and a negative? Well, if we think from the perspective of the triangle, then everything inside the triangle is part of triangle, and everything outside of triangle is out of triangle, like $t+$ and $t-$.

This other I, we give the concept of 0, or zero - nothingness. Before I existed, what was there? When I don't exist anymore, what is there? So, we signify the other as 0, and the I, the point of existence, as 1. And this point 0, we can also represent as a point, or rather the non-point (or place).

Thus we have two points, 0 & 1, and the "line" or space/time between them.

## Unpack

Start with number 1 (me, I). Think of it as a moment in "time" in which I (1) appear(s).

If 1 is aware, then there must have been a time when 1 was unaware, and as such, 1 did not exist, and that point we can represent as 0. In fact, we can represent this occurrence as 1 - 1 = 0.

This is a statement we are all familiar with. But if we break it down philosophically, it reads something like: If we remove (subtract) the 1 which has appeared, with another 1, then we will, in essence, have annihilated the 1st 1, and produced nothing, or emptiness, which is 0 - nothingness.

Now we have a 1, and a 0 - something & nothing. As well as an action (subtraction), from which we can almost propose the state of nothingness. Using our previous formulation, we could say the for every 1, there is a not-1, or ~1. So there naturally needs to be a process by which we can merge them somehow.

Interestingly enough, by only having the basic process of addition, '+', which is easily followed, by the example of if I have an apple, and you give me another apple then I have in my basket, 2 apples, an apple plus another apple... That is quite natural.

For the previous case, I could rephrase my statement as
1 + (~1). Which says: If I have an apple in my basket, and I add a "non-apple" to it, it will cancel out the apple and I will have an empty basket.

## Complimentarity

This also illustrates the Principle of the Anti, or the: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction", illustrated also in quantum theory, where for sub-atomic particle, there exists an anti-particle.

I extend the statement to: "For every object in the universe, there is an equal and opposite object". And I use the example of the triangle to show this (see fig on left, and refer to 'The 3 spaces' page).
