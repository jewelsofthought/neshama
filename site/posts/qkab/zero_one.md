There is a 1-1 correspondence between any set and the real numbers between 0 &amp; 1.

## "I am that I am"

Only the Divine, Great Spirit is expressed by $$"I am that I am"$$.

In a sense, it represents the trivial statement, the one of identity, represented by $$1 = 1$$.

However, the truth behind it is this: $$I$$ am the only $$I$$ that is fully $$I$$. In other words $$I$$ am the only $$I$$ that fulfils $$I = I$$. This is known as the "enlightened" one, a fully self-realised person. Any one else is $$I < I$$, incomplete, not fully realised, still in flux.

## Everything exists between 0 & 1.

How can I say that?

Before I continue, let me set the field. There are certain constraints within which I make that statement, which will become apparent. There even might be an exception to this rule that someone may think of. Thus, I will say that this statement is correct, with a negligible margin of error.

Mathematically speaking, there is a one-to-one correspondence between all the real numbers between 0 &amp; 1, and all the integers. In other words for every whole number there is a corresponding number less than one, and greater than zero.

## Atom of Existence

However, rather than launch into a rigorous rationalisation of this idea, I would like to present it rather as a story of an unfolding. A story starting with the awareness of being aware&mdash;something which I like to refer to as "The Axiom of Existence". All I know, without a doubt, is that I am alive, and aware of the fact that I am alive. With this awareness of being alive, comes the awareness of the state of not-being alive. Somehow, we have been granted the ability to perceive that which is not. In the presence of life, we perceive death.

$$I$$ exist.... $$I$$ am... $$I&nbsp;am&nbsp;the&nbsp;I$$. I identify this I as 1... a single entity. However, do not become confused, I am not the One that is everything. I am only one number in the infinity of possible numbers that make up the Infinite One.

In the beginning though, I am not aware of the end nor that there is even an end. A major step in consciousness is the realisation that I am going to die - which puts the I-story into a greater context. That is, although I live my life, something else&mdash;the same something that somehow enabled me to now awaken in this "place"&mdash;will at some unknown point, once again remove this particular awareness that I am now expressing (by writing this &ndash; for instance).

This I-ness is not yet an aware $$I$$. It is just conscious of its I-ness. For this $$i$$, it's I-ness is a fact (or life, one could say). It takes many years (six or so, I believe), for the $$i$$' to become aware of its $$I$$. And it actually only becomes real, upon authentically encountering another $$I$$ - which will generally happen through love, if 1 is lucky enough to experience it.{[The journey of the I](I.html)}

My story begins with the one $$i$$ am becoming. The only way to do that is to explore all the $$I$$ that 'I am not'... yet. {NOTE: Perhaps that is the only progression to contemplate. That which brings the $$i$$ to fully experience its own $$I-ness$$. As is said, "The only person to strive to be better than, to be superior to, is your own previous self." } Now, one thing one know(s), is that there was a time when there was no-one. As far as this particular one was concerned, there was no other one, 'no-thing', at very least, no one. So one decided to give itself a name, and called itself Point. This that this one can be represented by a point.

Another way of looking at it, is that every shape has a positive version and a negative one. For instance the triangle has both an inner triangle, and an outer one. Why is this a positive and a negative? Well, if we think from the perspective of the triangle, then everything inside the triangle is part of triangle, and everything outside of triangle is out of triangle, like $$t+$$ and $$t-$$.

This other I, we give the concept of 0, or zero - nothingness. Before I existed, what was there? When I don't exist anymore, what is there? So, we signify the other as 0, and the I, the point of existence, as 1. And this point 0, we can also represent as a point, or rather as the non-point (or place).

Thus we have two points, 0 & 1, and the "line" or space/time between them.

## Unpack

Start with number 1 (me, I). Think of it as a moment in "time" in which I (1) appear(s).

If 1 is aware, then there must have been a time when 1 was unaware, and as such, 1 did not exist, and that point we represent as 0. In fact, we can represent this death/extinction as 1 - 1 = 0.

This is a statement we are all familiar with. But if we break it down philosophically, it reads something like: If we remove (subtract) the 1 which has appeared, with another 1, then we will, in essence, have annihilated the 1st 1, and produced nothing, or emptiness, which is 0 &ndash;nothingness.

{NOTE: As a caveat, here is a fundamental difference in evolutionary perspective. This existential question is whether every one is the same as any (and every) other. In order to accept most mathematical proofs at this point, you will have to accept that every one is essentially the same. Thus I can easily say 1 - 1 = 0. But if I say that each one is unique, to do any mathematics will be extremely complex, and very soon reach insane levels of complexity. So, how do we deal with this problem?

Let us work it through this way. The space we are working in, is that space in which each one is unique, on the one hand, and that there is no difference between any one&mdash;they are all alike. These two extremes define our space/line. To be practical, we start with the simple, knowing that it might not be correct, and work out everything with that foundation. That is fine when one deals things that can be empirically compared. For instance, 1m = 1m... no doubt about it. In this case, the one only speaks of quantity. But, when we enter into more undefined areas, this is very limiting. Does 1 dog = 1 dog... Well, only if it is the same dog. In other words, every one is different. Now, if we base all our data models on this principle, we would have to reduce it to the case where 1 dog = 1 dog, else we will not be able to use our mathematical modelling to come to conclusions, and thus "solutions" (to what?).

This even becomes more out of sync when it is referring to human beings. Then numbers become death dealers, reducing humanity to a common pool of value, to be traded and used, just like an item of value.

We are on the cusp of stepping into an interaction that will enable us to have these methods of quantification expressing a greater set of diversities, rather than a single characteristic, that itself needs to be homogenised in order to be useful to our system of valuation.{[microsystems](microsystems.html)}
}

Now we have a 1, and a 0 - something & nothing. As well as an action (subtraction), from which we can almost propose the state of nothingness. Using our previous formulation, we could say the for every 1, there is a not-1, or $$\neg{1}$$. So there naturally needs to be a process by which we can merge them somehow.

Interestingly enough, by only having the basic process of addition, $$+$$, which is easily followed, by the example of if I have an apple, and you give me another apple then I have in my basket, 2 apples, an apple plus another apple... That is quite natural.

For the previous case, I could rephrase my statement as $$1 + \neg{1}$$). Which says: If I have an apple in my basket, and I add a "non-apple" to it, it will cancel out the apple and I will have an empty basket. This becomes, in a more limited sense expressed in the commonly known form $$1 + \(-1\)$$

## Complimentarity

This also illustrates the Principle of the Anti, or the: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction", illustrated also in quantum theory, where for every sub-atomic particle, there exists an anti-particle.

I extend the statement to: "For every object in the universe, there is an equal and opposite object". And I use the example of the triangle to show this (see fig on left, and refer to 'The 3 spaces' page).
