A complete sine wave in the time domain can be represented by one single spike in the frequency domain.

A single-frequency sine wave is not useful in data communication. We need to send a composite signal, a signal composed of many simple sine waves.
According to Fourier analysis, any composite signal is a combination of simple sine waves with different frequencies, amplitudes and phases.
