## Circular Journey

> Everything journey is circular

The circle becomes a spiral in time, as it has a "greater spiral" too, that is the emanatory impulse. We experience it as a wave, and see it as a sine wave.

A complete sine wave in the time domain can be represented by one single spike in the frequency domain.

A single-frequency sine wave is not useful in data communication. We need to send a composite signal, a signal composed of many simple sine waves.
According to Fourier analysis, any composite signal is a combination of simple sine waves with different frequencies, amplitudes and phases.
