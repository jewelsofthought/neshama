And has been most often used as a tool/weapon of oppression and power.

Now, if man is essentially evil, and a "sinner", according to current religious view, then one must assume that our leaders - who are just human - are evil too!

Which will bring us to the conclusion that we are in the grip of a powerful, oppressive group of evil leaders!

The "innocent until proven guilty" approach. However, guilt is decided according to the criterion and biases of the legal context within which this guilt is being decided. In the case of religion, there is the application of the laws of God according to the perspective and understanding of that particular culture - all influenced by human foibles and weaknesses and desires.

In fact, this premise of intrinsicly evil, has resulted in the doctrine of "Orignal Sin". Which proposes that God made us, and the world around us, essentially evil. If it is, in this case, up to Christ to redeem us, at worst. At best, for each one of us to make the right choices - even when we receive the wrong education - one that teaches us how to serve in society, but not how to deal with the moral, ethical or spiritual aspects of one's life.

### PEMS

| PEMS      | God is Good          |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| Physical  | Nutrition            |
| Emotional | Vicitudes of Puberty |
| Mental    | Clear thoughts       |
| Spiritual | Fear of G-d          |

If God is Good, why create evil people? No. Rather, why create everyone evil, and then we need to spend the rest of our lives "redeeming" ourselves? It is like being born in debt, and having to spend the rest of your lives paying someone back for the debt you "inherited".
