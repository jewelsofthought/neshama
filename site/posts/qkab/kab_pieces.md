## 3 splendours (pp 90,96)

> tzachtzachot - צחצחות

There is a connection with the Trinity and the three faces of the Hindu deity, and the trigram of the I’Ching.

צמצם or צימצום is the Kabbalistic _tsimtsum_, or constriction&mdash;through resistance begins the manifestion. Going from the spiritual, almost virtual energy to the grosser, thicker, slower energies that are the manifestations we are aware in. As such, it is a seen as circular, an expanding or contracting spiral.

One bifurcates. Two are manifest, the third splendour is the one that emerges as the relationship between the two manifest. It may emerge in multiple forms too, as the doubling, or joining of the two. It also continues the process of life, the bifurcation.

Perhaps the 3 are just really 3 out of the 10. As Judah Hasid mentions the 10 spheres, or ספירות… These are the 3 that are manifesting the known world. The rest are expressions, or steps into the ineffable. It seems that there are the 3 at the top, the six that make the One, and finally the Kingdom, מלכות, that manifests.

Of course, within מלכות, the pattern begins once again&mdash;the unmanifest, inner radiation of אין סוף.

An aspect of the finite within the infinite, in order for it (the finite) to be eternal, it will have to return to its beginning at some stage.

His is the Law, carried down from heaven. If the same structure, the same pattern, applies to both then obviously the same influence, the same laws, will have the same effect.

> If אין סוף is manifest, then It contains everything,

<div style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic">

In the beginning,
there was אין סוף
Then nothingness,
Then the 3 splendours,
Then 1st emanation
Then the Manifestation

G!d in relation to his creation
Assumes the existence of G!d.

G!d in relation to Himself
Is Incomprehensible
For He is a part of us,
And we are part of Creation.

## The kabbalist

> I was born in the cauldron of creation

A kabbalist does nothing... except perhaps pray &ndash; with all his heart and soul. All his work is in the upper realm. The one referred to as the imaginal realm. A realm exemplified by the imaginary numbers of mathematics, producing, through the intermarriage of the real and the imaginary, the realm of the complex.

He performs the acts necessary to maintain his physical being, but only in order to pursue his calling and work in the upper worlds.

Working as close to Source as he is able to, he has no apparent effect on anything tangible. As we are all connected to this source, his work can affect anything and everything. However, how long it will take till his actions manifest some effect, depends on many factors, both known and unknown.

## Kabbalah is a way of life.

In the past, in order to learn Kabbalah, or participate in this way of life, one had to be fully immersed in the Jewish tradition. Presently, it seems, that Kabbalah is often used as a means of drawing new age proponents into the Jewish fold. I'm afraid I don't really live up to the "requirements" of the modern (or ancient) Kabbalistic meme. However, I feel a connection with **HaShem**, _Adonai_ and the _Elohim_ almost constantly, hovering in the space between the immanent and the transcendent &ndash; in dialogue with both. Kabbalah has helped me to find a language with which to express that, and a means with which to come to terms with my "practice" thereof.

But living as a singular Jew in the mountains of the Eastern Cape&mdash;"frontier" country as it is called&mdash;brought here, btw, by following the flame by night and the cloud by day, I suddenly stepped into my own dream, and found my practice slipping. That space being filled by sublime moments alone and in communion with the greater "I" that surrounds all.
