## 3 splendours (pp 90,96)

> tzachtzachot - צחצחות

There is a connection with the Trinity and the three faces of the Hindu deity, and the trigram of the I’Ching.

צמצם or צימצום is the Kabbalistic _tsimtsum_, or constriction&mdash;through resistance begins the manifestion. Going from the spiritual, almost virtual energy to the grosser, thicker, slower energies that are the manifestations we are aware in. As such, it is a seen as circular, an expanding or contracting spiral.

One bifurcates. Two are manifest, the third splendour is the one that emerges as the relationship between the two manifest. It may emerge in multiple forms too, as the doubling, or joining of the two. It also continues the process of life, the bifurcation.

Perhaps the 3 are just really 3 out of the 10. As Judah Hasid mentions the 10 spheres, or ספירות… These are the 3 that are manifesting the known world. The rest are expressions, or steps into the ineffable. I am not sure. It seems that there are the 3 at the top, the six that make the One, and finally the Kingdom, מלכות, that manifests.

Of course, within מלכות, lies the pattern once again&mdash;the unmanifest, inner radiation of אין סוף.

His is the Law, carried down from heaven. If the same structure, the same pattern, applies to both then obviously the same influence, the same laws, will have the same effect.

> If אין סוף is manifest, then It contains everything,

<div style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic">

In the beginning,
there was אין סוף
Then nothingness,
Then the 3 splendours,
Then 1st emanation
Then the Manifestation

G!d in relation to his creation
Assumes the existence of G!d.

G!d in relation to Himself
Is Incomprehensible
For He is a part of us,
And we are part of Creation.
