## (I) 3 splendours (p96 – Kabbalah) tzachtzachot - צחצחות

There is a connection with the Trinity and the three faces of the Hindu deity, and the trigram of the I’Ching.

- It is a palindrome as צחצח I thought this was צמצם or צימצום, which is the Kabbalistic צימצום, or shrinking, resistance, manifesting. Going from the spiritual, almost virtual energy to the grosser, thicker, slower energies that are the manifestations we live in. As such, it is a circle. Only two are manifest. The third splendour is the one that manifests in form, in the relationship between the parts, i.e. spirit. It has multiple forms too. As it is also the doubling, or joining of the two.
- Perhaps the 3 are just really 3 out of the 10. As Judah Hasid "mentions 10 spheres, or ספירות…" These are the 3 that are manifesting the known world. The rest are expressions, or steps into the ineffable. I am not sure I agree with this. It seems that there are the 3 at the top, the six that make the One, and finally the Kingdom, מלכות.

## (II) Everything fits

The unmanifest, inner radiation of אין סוף:

![Tree within Tree](/posts/img/qkab/tree_in_tree.png)

Now, of course, within מלכות, lies the pattern once again.

His is the Law, carried down from heaven. If the same structure, the same pattern, applies to both then obviously the same influence, the same laws, will have the same effect.

It is the same thing:

<div style="margin-left: 2rem">
  In the beginning, there was אין סוף<br />
  Then nothingness,<br />
  Then the 3 splendours,<br />
  Then 1st emanation<br />
  Then the Manifestation (p90)
</div>

P88 – Kabbalah
G!d in relation to his creation
Assumes the existence of G!d.

G!d in relation to Himself
Is Incomprehensible
For He is a part of us,
And we are part of Creation.

(p91)
x1. Disagree. It is a natural consequence, and is derived from amongst the concept in physics of a parallel universe.
If אין סוף is manifest, then It contains everything,

## (III) QK: Kabbalistic/Quantum interpretation of the 4 worlds.

| _Sefirah_    | Physical  | Entity  | Vibration     |
| ------------ | --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| **Atzilut**  | Spiritual | Creator | Ein-soph      |
| **Beriah**   | Quantum   | Light   | Emanation     |
| **Yetzirah** | Chemical  | Water   | Atomic        |
| **Assiyah**  | Organic   | Earth   | Gravitational |

## (IV) Dimensions

<blockquote dir="rtl">
יענך יהוה ביום ישלח עזרך מקדש
</blockquote>

Creates the 4 dimensions, the circling curved ה’s.
Doubled -> 4 dim = stability, structure.
5th element, added to understand the 4th dim. Just as the squares on the right angled triangle are needed to find the size of one of the sides. Also produces (and holds) the upper and the lower.

Underlying everything are the broad strokes, the “axioms”, the philosophic agreements, physical laws, etc. These are so subtle, that only gifted individuals can comprehend them and of those only the destined become anointed.

Actually, in each world there are core principles.

| Realm           | Worldly   | M/F   |
| --------------- | --------- | ----- |
| Kabbalah        | Spiritual | (m/f) |
| Physics         | Physical  | (m/f) |
| Math/Logic      | Mental    | (m)   |
| Psychology/Mind | Emotional | (f)   |

## (V) QK: Electron Existence

Spiritual - Manifest awareness of itself

Self-realisation, quantum existence throughout, and eventually the energy would become self-aware.

Electrons are spinning clockwise or anti-clockwise. Perhaps it is a spiral and the electron spirals from a point to an area of activity and back again, very fast. After all, what is this “energy” that it possesses? It is coming into being and returning to the Source, all the time (**Hod**/re-verberation/vibration).

It would almost be absurd to think of the $$e^-$$ as individuating—to think of asking the question of whether it is the same $$e^-$$ that manifests each time. It could be a different $$e^-$$ each time. So $$e^-$$ spirals out, and $$e^-$$ could emerge back in the same spot. Because of the laws of G!d, blessed be the Creator of everything, there will be a requirement of that energy to manifest and the Lord, in His Loving Kindness, will provide it.

Consciousness can affect this manifestation and its behaviour, so you can never know if it is or isn’t the same $$e^-$$.

How can we always measure this as clockwise, if it is being reborn? How does anything maintain state? There has to be some universal memory/principle, an energy that maintains the narrative, the so-called continuum which we call our memory-and perceive as time. This has to be able to be embedded in the structure of being. This becomes your dialogue with the Creator. For your memory will reproduce effects. This the way in which I begin to create my own reality, participating in my own creation.

$$e^-$$ also moves around. So there is an area of birth. The sphere for the _‘s’_ orbitals, the tears for the _‘p’_, etc. _‘p’_ are the tears that form quantum flowers of the universe. They are also the place where the interactions take place. This digs into quantum ideas of limitations of areas of influence.

The $$e^-$$ would spin on all the vectors available in the sphere, completely “occupying” its orbital. Why then only clockwise and anti-clockwise? Because the emanations obey certain laws just like the angels. It can perceive only itself or its opposite. An $$e^-$$ of spin $$\theta$$ would only recognise one of opposite spin,$$-{\theta}$$, or one of the same spin.

Is downward independent of the clockwise spin or not?

The neutrons and protons—and perhaps the sub-atomic particles, the muons, gluons, etc., as well—have the same characteristics. They are all actually spiralling in and out of existence. That is why they have clockwise and anti-clockwise motions, plus the up and down directions.
