## (I) 3 splendours

P96 – Kabbalah:

> tzachtzachot - צחצחות

There is a connection with the Trinity and the three faces of the Hindu deity, and the trigram of the I’Ching.

צמצם or צימצום is the Kabbalistic _tsimtsum_, or shrinking, resistance, manifesting. Going from the spiritual, almost virtual energy to the grosser, thicker, slower energies that are the manifestations we live in. As such, it is a seen as a circular, the expanding or contracting spiral.
Two are manifest, the third splendour is the one that manifests as the relationship between the two manifest parts. It will emerge in multiple forms too, as it is also the doubling, or joining of the two.

Perhaps the 3 are just really 3 out of the 10. As Judah Hasid mentions the 10 spheres, or ספירות… These are the 3 that are manifesting the known world. The rest are expressions, or steps into the ineffable. I am not sure I agree with this. It seems that there are the 3 at the top, the six that make the One, and finally the Kingdom, מלכות, that manifests.

Now, of course, within מלכות, lies the pattern once again&mdash;the unmanifest, inner radiation of אין סוף.

His is the Law, carried down from heaven. If the same structure, the same pattern, applies to both then obviously the same influence, the same laws, will have the same effect.

P90 - Kabbalah:

<div style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic">
  In the beginning, there was אין סוף<br />
  Then nothingness,<br />
  Then the 3 splendours,<br />
  Then 1st emanation<br />
  Then the Manifestation 
</div>

P88 – Kabbalah:
G!d in relation to his creation
Assumes the existence of G!d.

G!d in relation to Himself
Is Incomprehensible
For He is a part of us,
And we are part of Creation.

p91 - Kabbalah:
x1. Disagree. It is a natural consequence, and is derived from amongst the concept in physics of a parallel universe.
If אין סוף is manifest, then It contains everything,

## (III) Interpretation of the 4 worlds.

| _Sefirah_    | Physical  | Entity  | Vibration     |
| ------------ | --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| **Atzilut**  | Spiritual | Creator | Ein-soph      |
| **Beriah**   | Quantum   | Light   | Emanation     |
| **Yetzirah** | Chemical  | Water   | Atomic        |
| **Assiyah**  | Organic   | Earth   | Gravitational |

## (IV) Dimensions

<blockquote dir="rtl">
יענך יהוה ביום ישלח עזרך מקדש
</blockquote>

Creates the 4 dimensions, the circling curved ה’s.
Doubled -> 4 dim = stability, structure.
5th element, added to understand the 4th dim. Just as the squares on the right angled triangle are needed to find the size of one of the sides. Also produces (and holds) the upper and the lower.

Underlying everything are the broad strokes, the “axioms”, the philosophic agreements, physical laws, etc. These are so subtle, that only gifted individuals can comprehend them and of those only the destined become anointed.

In each world there are core principles. Each one has its own "physics" and aspect of time.

| Realm           | Worldly   | M/F   |
| --------------- | --------- | ----- |
| Kabbalah        | Spiritual | (m/f) |
| Physics         | Physical  | (m/f) |
| Math/Logic      | Mental    | (m)   |
| Psychology/Mind | Emotional | (f)   |

## (V) Electron Existence

Spiritual - Manifest awareness of itself

Self-realisation, quantum existence throughout, and eventually the energy would become self-aware.

Electrons are spinning clockwise or anti-clockwise. Perhaps the electron spirals from a point to an area of activity and back again, very fast&mdash;faster than we can "see" or measure. After all, what is this “energy” that it possesses? It is coming into being and returning to the Source, all the time (**Hod**/re-verberation/vibration). As $$e^-$$ spirals out, and emerges back in the same spot. Because of the laws of G!d, blessed be the Creator of everything, there will be a need for that energy to manifest and the Lord, in His Loving Kindness, will provide it.

Is it absurd to think of the $$e^-$$ as individuating? To wonder whether it is the same $$e^-$$ that manifests each time? To imagine that it could be a different $$e^-$$ each time? How would we be able to tell?

Many things, some of which we are aware of, and some not could affect this manifestation and its behaviour. If it was consciousness that could influence it, we could never know if it is or isn’t the same $$e^-$$.

How can we always measure this as clockwise, if it is being reborn? How does anything maintain state? There has to be some universal principle, an energy that maintains the narrative, the so-called continuum which we refer to as memory&mdash;and perceive as time. This has to be embedded in the very structure of being. This becomes your dialogue with the Creator. For your memory will reproduce effects. This the way in which I begin to create my own reality, participating in my the creation of my own specific narrative.

$$e^-$$ also moves around. So there is an area of birth. The sphere for the _‘s’_ orbitals, the tears for the _‘p’_, that form quantum flowers of the universe. They are also the place where interactions take place.

The $$e^-$$ would spin on all the vectors available in the sphere, completely “occupying” its orbital. Why then only clockwise and anti-clockwise? Because the emanations obey certain laws just like the angels. They can only manifest under certain conditions, and thus are all constrained similarly. It being a 2 dimensional being, it can perceive only itself or its opposite. An $$e^-$$ of spin $$\theta$$ would only recognise one of opposite spin,$$-{\theta}$$, or one of the same spin.

The neutrons and protons&mdash;perhaps all the sub-atomic particles are actually spiralling in and out of existence.
