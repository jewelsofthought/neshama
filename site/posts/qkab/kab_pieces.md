## 3 splendours (pp 90,96)

> tzachtzachot - **צחצחות**

There is a connection with the Trinity and the three faces of the Hindu deity, and the trigram of the I’Ching.

**צמצם** or **צימצום** is the Kabbalistic _tsimtsum_, or constriction &mdash; through resistance begins the manifestion. Going from the spiritual, almost virtual energy to the grosser, thicker, slower energies that are the manifestations we are aware in. As such, it is a seen as circular, an expanding or contracting spiral.

One bifurcates. Two are manifest, the third splendour is the one that emerges as the relationship between the two manifest. It may emerge in multiple forms too, as the doubling, or joining of the two. It also continues the process of life, the bifurcation.

Perhaps the 3 are just really 3 out of the 10. As Judah Hasid mentions the 10 spheres, or **ספירות**… These are the 3 that are manifesting the known world. The rest are expressions, or steps into the ineffable. It seems that there are the 3 at the top, the six that make the One, and finally the Kingdom, **מלכות**, that manifests.

</figure>

Of course, within **מלכות**, the pattern begins once again &mdash; the unmanifest, inner radiation of **אין סוף**.

An aspect of the finite within the infinite, is that in order for it (the finite) to be eternal, it will have to return to its original form at some stage.

His is the Law, carried down from heaven. If the same structure, the same pattern, applies to both then obviously the same influence, the same laws, will have the same effect.

> If אין סוף is manifest, then It contains everything,

<div class="poem">

In the beginning,
there was <b>אין סוף</b>
Then nothingness,
Then the 3 splendours,
Then 1st emanation
Then the Manifestation

G!d in relation to his creation
Assumes the existence of G!d.

G!d in relation to Himself
Is Incomprehensible
For He is a part of us,
And we are part of Creation.

</div>

## The kabbalist

> I was born in the cauldron of creation

A kabbalist does nothing... except perhaps pray &mdash; with all his heart and soul. All his work is in the upper realm. The one referred to as the imaginal realm. A realm exemplified by the imaginary numbers of mathematics, producing, through the intermarriage of the real and the imaginary, the realm of the complex.

He performs the acts necessary to maintain his physical being, but only in order to pursue his calling and work in the upper worlds.

Working as close to Source as he is able to, he has no apparent effect on anything tangible. As we are all connected to this source, his work can affect anything and everything. However, how long it will take till his actions manifest some effect, depends on many factors, both known and unknown.

## Kabbalah is a way of life

In the past, in order to learn Kabbalah, or participate in this way of life, one had to be fully immersed in the Jewish tradition. Presently, it seems, that Kabbalah is often used as a means of drawing new age proponents into the Jewish fold. I'm afraid I don't really live up to the "requirements" of the modern (or ancient) Kabbalistic meme. However, I feel a connection with **HaShem**, _Adonai_ and the _Elohim_ almost constantly, hovering in the space between the immanent and the transcendent &ndash; in dialogue with both. Kabbalah has helped me to find a language with which to express that, and a means with which to come to terms with my "practice" thereof.

But living as a singular Jew in the mountains of the Eastern Cape&mdash;"frontier" country as it is called&mdash;brought here, btw, by following the flame by night and the cloud by day, I suddenly stepped into my own dream, and found my practice slipping. That space being filled by sublime moments alone and in communion with the greater "I" that surrounds all.

## In depth

**G‑d said to Moses: “Come in to Pharaoh” (10:1)**

Rabbi Shimon [bar Yochai] continued: It is now fitting to reveal mysteries connected with that which is above and that which is below. Why is it written, “Come in to Pharaoh”? Ought it not rather have said, “Go to Pharaoh”? It is to indicate that G‑d brought Moses into a chamber within a chamber, into the abode of the supernal mighty serpent that is the soul of Egypt, from whom many lesser serpents emanate. Moses was afraid to approach him, because his roots are in supernal regions, and he approached only his subsidiary streams. When G‑d saw that Moses feared the serpent, He said, “Come in to Pharaoh.”

(Zohar)

**We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters (10:9)
**
Pharaoh was willing to let the menfolk go, as long as the children remain behind; for as long as the younger generation remains “in Egypt,” there would be no future for the people of Israel.

The “Pharaohs” of our day have the same attitude. If the older folk wish to cling to Jewish tradition, that is perfectly acceptable; but the youth should be raised in “the spirit of the times” . . .

(Maayanah Shel Torah

---

**Stretch out your hand towards heaven, that there shall be darkness over the land of Egypt (10:21)**

Why did G‑d . . . bring darkness upon the Egyptians? Because there were transgressors in Israel who had Egyptian patrons and who lived in affluence and honor, and were unwilling to leave. So G‑d said: “If I bring upon them publicly a plague from which they will die, the Egyptians will say: ‘Just as it has passed over us, so has it passed over them.’” Therefore He brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, so that the [Israelites] should bury their dead without their enemies seeing them.

(Midrash Rabbah

---

**A man did not see his fellow, nor did anyone get up from his place for three days (10:23)**

There were six days of darkness. . . . During the first three, “a man did not see his fellow”; during the last three days, one who was sitting could not stand up, one who was standing could not sit down, and one who was lying down could not raise himself upright.

(Midrash Rabbah)

There is no greater darkness than one in which “a man did not see his fellow”—in which a person becomes oblivious to the needs of his fellow man. When that happens, a person becomes stymied in his personal development as well—“nor did anyone get up from his place.”

(Chiddushei HaRim)

**G‑d spoke to Moses . . . : “Please, speak into the ears of the people, that every man ask of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, articles of silver, and articles of gold . . .” (11:2)**

Why was it so important that the children of Israel should carry out the wealth of Egypt, to the extent that this was foretold hundreds of years earlier to Abraham as an indispensable component of their redemption?

Every creation contains a “spark of holiness” which embodies its divine purpose. When a person utilizes an object, force or phenomenon to serve the Creator, thereby realizing its function within G‑d’s overall purpose for creation, he “redeems” and “elevates” the divine spark at its core.

Every soul has its own “sparks” scattered about in the world, which actually form an integral part of itself: no soul is complete until it has redeemed those sparks which belong to its mission in life. Therein lies the purpose of galut in all its forms: the exile of the soul from its sublime origins to the physical world, and the various exiles that nations and individuals experience in the course of their history, impelled from place to place and from occupation to occupation by seemingly random forces. All is by divine providence, which guides every man to those possessions and opportunities whose “spark” is intimately connected with his.

As the father and prototype of all exiles, the Egyptian galut was a highly concentrated period of history, in which the foundations were laid for all that was to unfold in subsequent centuries. The material world contains 288 general “sparks” (each of which includes innumerable offshoots and particles); of these, 202 were taken out of Egypt, redeemed and elevated when the Jewish people carried off its gold and silver and used these to construct a sanctuary for G‑d in the desert (see Exodus 25–31).

(The Chassidic Masters)

**Time** is the first creation (see Sforno on Genesis 1:1); thus, the sanctification of time is the first mitzvah commanded to Israel.

(Lubavitzer Rabbi)

**A mixed multitude went up also with them (12:38)**

The Hebrew word rav (“multitude”) has a numerical value of 202; the “mixed multitude” represents the 202 sparks of holiness that the Jewish people extracted from Egypt (see commentary on 11:2 above).

(The Kabbalists)

## Gaze into the Face of G-d

Why should we be afraid to look into the face of G!d and die? For will we not then end up in heaven with the Angels? What is wrong with that?
The story of the four Rabbis ascending to the Pardes – the throne room of the Divine. One saw the beauty and died. Clearly, upon encountering the Divine glory, he decided to remain. If we have an encounter with the Divine, would we not want to stay there – in that space? If you met your Beloved, would you not want to spend eternity with your B'shirt?

That is the True sex drive – Desire for Union with the Beloved – the search for your B'shirt.

The descent is also a descent into Duality. Where you see the One as Two. As described in the story of one of the four Rabbis – the one who entered and “became an apostate”, because he saw two where there is only One. The is the move into movement and form, that had to happen on a soul level.

Metaphorically, it is the wave seeking its "identity". Just like we are the expression of a wave that has "collapsed into time", a spirit being (which is equivalent to a wave in our vocabulary), incorporeal, and timeless, manifesting in this 3d skin and existence.

In fact, this is termed the _Tzimtzum_ – separation created by the contraction of the spiritual potential that is derived from the Omnipotent Presence. If desire is the only energy – what is your desire? Some say the ultimate is to desire nothing, no movement. However, the soul has now been split into masculine and feminine. They long to be joined into the Holy Matrimony of Union.

As expressed in the film the Broken Crystal – the crystal that has a shard missing, creating Good and Bad. And the end is of them coming together, the light and the shadow, wave and particle joining to become the Supernal light – the light that throws no shadow, known as “Tikkun Olam”.

## Free will and angels

Call this “angels fear to tread” because they are forbidden to come down here without invitation or permission. They are also “afraid” to come down here, as they need to purify themselves after contact with this realm. Yet they are drawn to experience the realm of free will and once, having tasted it, they might revolt – and go “against” the will of G!d and, G!d forbid, sin – where sin is defined as not obeying the Will of Ha'Shem. This is perhaps the story of Samael and his cohorts, who, after co-habiting with humans, became tainted and had to be removed by the flood.

In fact, there is a possibility, that that is what the impetus to the story of the fall actually was. And we are fashioned from angels who wish to experience “free will”.

## Realm of Spirit

The realm of spirit accessible via the imagination. Which brings me to propose to call what is referred to by the sages as the realm of the intellect, as the realm of the imagination.[^1]

In the beginning we walked with G!d (Adonai). There was no separation between mind and spirit, which occurred only after the flood!
The spiritual realm consists of live “spirits”, which is one of the names for angels. To access this realm, one of the places to start is Ezekiel's vision, upon which the _Merkaba_ mysticism is based.

The Holocaust is was a deluge, like the flood, it too removed a generation. Why? What was their “sin”? It says if we are righteous, we will be rewarded, yet many orthodox Jews died in this deluge. What went wrong?
Perhaps the Holocaust generation was too devout. If you do the same thing over and over again, how can you expect a different result? We are now accessing 4th dimensional information, seeing different things, understanding the unseen as science. What a methodist minister calls “New light – old light...” We cannot live life looking into the rear-view mirror. Only a fool trips up on what is behind him.

They say we are far removed from Sinai, when we were holier, thus closer to G!d. I say perhaps we are further removed from the generation that sinned and were not allowed to enter the Holy Land. We have moved from needing animal sacrifices - which themselves were a replacement of human sacrifices - and use instead prayer. Which is indicative of removing the “animal” in you and sacrificing it to a Higher purpose.

Perhaps we are closer to entering the mystical Holy Land. May we be the generation that will merit that – entering into the Olam Ha'ba, the place we will walk in the presence of the Lord, **ברוך שם קבוד**... at our side.
Perhaps the veil, the מחסום, is getting thinner and we will be able to communicate with the angels – only this time it is a more self-aware communication, a live conversation, a conscious one, where we will sit at the feet of the Holy Presence, when we need to. Like a friend, whom we visit, or who visits us, when we want. Whom we call upon when we are in need.

Similar to the way that **HaShem** appears to people (not necessarily prophets) in the _Tanach_.

There are many tales in the Torah of the appearance of **HaShem** to others besides Israelites and Jewish Israeli Prophets. Prophets are designated by people, not by G!d. He chooses those who He wants to fulfil His purpose. In the same way, we choose people to fulfil our purpose(s) – not to fulfil His Holy Purpose.
