# Wave/Particle

Any wave can be represented in any wave form.

The [included middle](/posts/qkab/middle/) is the domain of the involuntary, the "wave".

The particle represents the intention, which sets the direction of the vector.

It is always in flux, always in motion. "The river of time continues to flow, and will continue to flow until the end of existence".
