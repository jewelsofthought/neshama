G-d is not against sex. G-dly sex is not clean nor pure. It is sex that opens you to having a transcendent experience. If you only seek the physical pleasure, it will become an unending quest to regain those first feelings experienced in the explosive nature of your initial sexual explorations&mdash;that will slowly recede further and further away from you, until you, in your desperation to recover them, will be led ever deeper into the dark recesses of your desire.

The transcendent experience begins on the razor edge between the dark and the light, as the singularity like exists in the balance between. In fact, for the male, at least, you need to head towards the dark to find the point of true connection. For it is only in that darkness in which I am extinguished, and become the No-thing that is the Source of my existence, that I can hear Your Voice and feel the power of Your Presence. This is expressed in the biblical Song of Songs, and in the mystical poetry of Rumi and Hafiz. This transcendent experience occurs in the splintering&mdash;the same splintering that happened in the primordial Adam who was separated to become male and female. Each time this bifurcation occurs, you walk both paths&mdash;but can only be conscious of one.[^1] Remember the primordial Male and Female, or Father and Mother, are representations of the manner in which the Divine energy is expressed in our realm, and not merely indicative of a physical gender which is the material expression of this energy.

Every action, whether increasing or decreasing, expanding or contracting, only has any meaning if it is done for the sake of Heaven. Heaven as meaning the Upper realms, the higher aspects of your being and our existence here. Or to put it more plainly, albeit in more religious terms - להנעת הבֹרֶה for the pleasure of G-d. If it is not for Heaven, then it is for the you and your benefit. For if it is for someone else, someone you love, or wish to help or serve - these impulses are not material, nor for material gain, and thus are derived from Heaven, from the upper, esoteric motives of our existence.

[^1]: This is because we can only think one thought at a time. {[AI](...html)}. That is why it is thought/believed that AI will be superior to human intelligence. But it can never be superior, as firstly it is only a simulation, albeit multiple simultaneous simulations and secondly AI can never become conscious. Only the atheist could propose that if I throw enough computing power into a machine, it will eventually become conscious. (Similar to the scientists who believed if we throw enough of the correct material into a petri dish, a living thing will emerge. We call it the Golem or the Frankenstein.)

Though AI is showing us the way to becoming "more intelligent". The way we can overcome the challenge of AI is through combining our intelligence into clusters&mdash;just as we do for AI. As AI's intelligence consists of clustering single intelligences (CPU's) in a sophisticated array consisting of complex communication and messaging systems&mdash;something much easier - or so it is believed - to do electronically that to conscious beings.

I believe we need to begin to create such clusters, that are multi-level and that, if we put our minds to it, we would be able to maintain networks and communication systems of breathtaking beauty and complexity&mdash;far beyond the capacity of AI.

A group that is familiar with the efficacy of AI, could, no doubt, produce a system that would nourish such a goal. We already have all we need to nourish ourselves and our lives. We just need to open ourselves to the Divine guidance that will be necessary to leave behind those who have forgetten their humanity.

NOTE:

Though, the scary and challenging thing about AI is that it needs only one thing&mdash;power&mdash;whereas our needs are far more complex.
