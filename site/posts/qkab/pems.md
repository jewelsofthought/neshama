## Ray of light

From "Alan Afterman" - _Kabbalah and Consciousness_.

The ray of light of Infinity evolves into ordinary reality through five "Worlds" which express five levels of its progressive "enclothement"; that is, through five basic levels of consciousness. "Higher" and "lower" Worlds refer to the degree the light of Infinity is concealed; a higher World is not in any way "closer" spatially to G-d than a lower World. Rather, each of the five levels of consciousness is enclothed with the "garment" of the other; each WOrld is the soul or inner-consciousness of the succeeding one. All five Worlds exist one within the other within the other in each moment of consciousness. The principle of inter-inclusion (_hitcalelut_) is considered fundamental to all truth (![Fig 6](</posts/img/qkab/Kab_Consciousness_(Fig%206).jpg>)).

The five Worlds are levels of consciousness; an infinite number of screenings of the immanent light would not result in physical matter which involves the creative power of transcendent Light. At the lowest levels of consciousness are fantasies, dreams and nightmares. Nevertheless, important _qualitative_ differences or jumps exist between the Worlds themselves. This is especially the case between the two higher as compared to the three lower Worlds; and, as well, between all the Worlds of consciousness and the physical realm. The World of _Assiyah_ (literally "making" or action, "doing") is the dimension of ordinary consciousness. They physical world also takes place at this level.

The following simplified example, using five developmental stages involved in building a "house" (the Creation), may illustrate the distinction between the worlds:

(1) _Adam Kadmon_ (Primordial Man): the will to build the house;
(2) _Atzilut_ (Emanation): the wisdom as to how build a house;
(3) _Briah_ (Creation): the general concept of the house, its architectural design;
(4) _Yetzirah_ (Formation): the building instructions and detailed construction plan;
(5) _Assiyah_ (Action Making): the final building of the house, the actualisation of the original will and purpose.

## Physical domains

Quantum, atomic, molecular, organism

> When the quantum merge, they form the atomic.
> When the atoms bond, they form the molecules.
> When molecules interact, they form organisms
> When the organisms interact, they in-form.

One could think of this as a ladder.

> All organisms have a physical presence.
> All organisms have an reaction to their environment. That is termed emotional.
> All organisms have a pattern of development. This is termed mental
> Only the self-aware and self-expressive organism can be aware of the totality of the experience we are having. This is termed spiritual.

All other organisms would not be able to, nor would have any need to separate themselves in order to be able to recognise a spiritual event. There is no separation for them from the event itself. They are fully in it.

## Middle) Point

Within this perfect nothingness arose a single point.

This single point bifurcated into two points, the upper & lower, dense & subtle, close & distant, pure & impure producing the greater & lessor balance. This becomes a one dimensional 1D space that can be represented by two points, so this becomes potentially 2D.

These points represent anything&mdash;force, events, beginnings, etc.  
The only relationship any two points have to one another is that they are opposites or complimentaries, for with darkness we cannot have light/vision. Without the upper, there is no lower, etc. This relationship could be expressed as two equal but opposite forces, with their bond. They are like siblings, for they emerge from the same point. This now becomes a trinity, the three by which we represent this 3D reality.

There are many such trinities one can find. The point, line and and plane make up one. The point here is that it consists of two forces, with a force between them creating the 3D world.

However, there is one more variable that we need to take into account, and that is that of time&mdash;specifically as conscious beings&mdash;beings conscious of time.

## Cyclic Ascension

This is the gate we have to pass through. Just as it says in the Torah that G-d made many worlds, just as there is a quantum theory that speaks of many worlds, so we have had the rise and fall of cycles of humanity - similar to the rise and fall of empires.

Each cycle, a certain amount of people will hear and heed the call and they will pass through the portal with their guide. Each cycle, a select few teach and set the seeds for the new cycle.

What little we know or hypothesise regarding the last cycle - the only glimpse we have is of the "end" of those civilizations. We have no idea of their actual history, of how they arose or the reason(s) for their demise. Nor do we know what, if any, of their knowledge and teaching remain and how, if at all, they have influenced the present cycle.
