## Cyclic Ascension

This is the gate we have to pass through. Just as it says in the Torah that G-d made many worlds, just as there is a quantum theory that speaks of many worlds, so we have had the rise and fall of cycles of humanity - similar to the rise and fall of empires.

Each cycle, a certain amount of people will hear and heed the call and they will pass through the portal with their guide. Each cycle, a select few teach and set the seeds for the new cycle.

What little we know or hypothesise regarding the last cycle - the only glimpse we have is of the "end" of those civilizations. We have no idea of their actual history, of how they arose or the reason(s) for their demise. Nor do we know what, if any, of their knowledge and teaching remain and how, if at all, they have influenced the present cycle.
