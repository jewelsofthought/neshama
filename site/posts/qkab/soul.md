1. [Soul](#soul)
2. [Spiritual/Material](#spiritualmaterial)
3. [Three Souls](#three-souls)

- **G-d is infinite** in all directions. Thus He/She is infinitely vulnerable too, just as He/She can be incredibly cruel too.

People don't look for a religion. We have a destination, and they will take the path that will best lead them to their destination, not taking into account the disruptive effects of their destinies.

## Soul

1. Soul is immortal.
   It hears and sees and keeps everything that happens, or at least a portion of it. This portion we call a pointer and, as hypnosis has shown, again and again, through this mechanism, everything can be recalled. Freud called it the unconscious, then the sub-conscious, now it is repressed, etc... It is the deep reservoir of our experiences. We collect them and return with them, like a wandering explorer who returns with a knapsack full of experiences. Like arriving back at school after the summer vacation, filled with stories of the adventures you had.
2. The purpose of soul is to serve -
   Because it does not need anything.
3. Soul needs to be resurrected in the body to good (_Mitzvah_).
   _The body needs to be kept clean by proper nourishment. The emotions need to be constrained, and we need to be mentored to think uplifting thoughts_
4. Each incarnation expresses one purpose of the soul.
   _You are a soul, here to play a role_.
5. The marriage union of two souls becoming one is the re-union of a soul that had split apart.

## Spiritual/Material

We enmesh the spiritual in the material in a very human way. We hide our lies and deceptions in that hidden, imaginary space, as well as our beauty and love. But what if the consequences of what we do materially have, essentially, spiritual consequences, and not only the spiritual ones that we normally are concerned about. {For, in order for us to do anything, there must be a spirit, an intention, a will(ingness). This is the "spiritual" reason or energy that you use to get something done.} Let us first focus on the purely material consequences of our actions, before we delve in the hidden aspects - and that is what I think jurisprudence is expressing. However the judicial system that emerges is crafted by those in power, and thus becomes a tool for maintaining that power - if not in the beginning, but without a doubt emerges at some stage. It starts with revolution to gain freedom, and then the leaders of the revolution become the oppressors - just different faces.

<p class="note">
{NOTE: Revolution - from the world revolve. So a revolution does not mean inherent change, they are generally just face-lifts. Evolution speaks of inherent change in the way it was done. To quote a Sages: "The only form of evolution is to one in which you become better than your previous self".}

Notice here, I do not say that they do not affect the spiritual realm, but perhaps not in the manner nor due to the events as we believe. As the system is continuous, or recursive - in that the every event is based on a sequence of events that occurred so that the seminal event could manifest. One cannot have vision without an eye, and a "brain" or perceptor of some nature that can "see" the vision. In other words, it has both the mechanism/technology available to see, and the perceptive capability to perceive and cognite (in some meaningful fashion) what is being seen. The one is purely technical, or empirical, the other is uncertain. To the materialist, it is the chemicals, or microtubules, or some other physical measurable event that occurs... whereas to the imaginative, there seems to be another element involved that we cannot measure with our empirical measurements, and is uncertain as to where exactly it is situated - in the brain, or elsewhere. This we call the realm of spirit, or soul.

## Three Souls

Your lower soul, _Nefesh_, is your "life force" - that which vivifies the clay that forms your body. Your upper soul, _Neshamah_, is the breath/spirit that descends from above. It is the breath that is "breathed" into you. From that place is where we need to find an other future, called "The World to Come" or the "Coming World". Between these two souls, there is another, that is like the wind that blows between the two. As the other is like the breath, this is the wind, the air, that moves from there to here, and is called _Ruach_, a wind that enters from outside, and is expelled from inside. Thus there is the breath, the breather, and the "air" that is breathed. Lastly _Nefesh_ is the breath that has entered the consciousness, and has to settle, rest, a moment so that it can be utilised. As, in all Creation, there is the transmission and the receiving, and then the pause, the recipient.
