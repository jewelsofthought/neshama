# G-d is infinite

- **G-d is infinite** in all directions. Thus He/She is infinitely vulnerable too, just as He/She can be incredibly cruel too.

People don't look for a religion. We have a destination, and they will take the path that will best lead them to their destination, not taking into account the disruptive effects of their destinies.

## Soul

1. Soul is immortal.
   It hears and sees and keeps everything that happens, or at least a portion of it. This portion we call a pointer and, as hypnosis has shown, again and again, through this mechanism, everything can be recalled. Freud called it the unconscious, then the sub-conscious, now it is repressed, etc... It is the deep reservoir of our experiences. We collect them and return with them, like a wandering explorer who returns with a knapsack full of experiences. Like arriving back at school after the summer vacation, filled with stories of the adventures you had.

> **NOTE:** The USA, in its typical empirical, and capitalistic fashion, had to manufacture this summer vacation, and introduced the spring break event - which has now grown into a global sex, drugs and perversion fest for our young.

2. The purpose of soul is to serve -
   Because it does not need anything.

3. Soul needs to be resurrected in the body to good (_Mitzvah_).
4. Each incarnation expresses one purpose of the soul.
   _You are a soul, here to play a role_.
5. The marriage union of two souls becoming one is the re-union of a soul that had split apart.

## Mathematics

Take a mathematical approach to the spiritual realm, we seek spiritual equations with which we can express the dynamics of the system we are in more truthfully. There may be a spiritual calculus which can be used to describe the interactions that is more descriptive. Just as mathematics challenged and made more coherent, a large portions of our interactions with the world around us, so this spiritual mathematics would do to challenge much of the flotsam that floats around the central lake.

Mathematics does not posit a self as fundamental to being, just a sense of self. We, however, have a false sense of self by believing that any meaningful understanding of this self can be separate from the environment in which it was and is experiencing, as if we could be separate from the brain processing. I mean, we think in our native tongue... and how many different languages have humans already spoken that we know of - and how many more are there to come?

---## Spiritual/Material

We enmesh the spiritual in the material in a very human way. We hide our lies and deceptions in that hidden, imaginary space, as well as our beauty and love. But what if the consequences of what we do materially have, essentially, material consequences, and not the spiritual ones that we normally are concerned about. Let us first focus on the purely material consequences of our actions, before we delve in the hidden aspects - and that is what I think jurisprudence is expressing. However the judicial system that emerges is crafted by those in power, and thus becomes a tool for maintaining that power - if not in the beginning, but without a doubt emerges at some stage. It starts with revolution to gain freedom, and then the leaders of the revolution become the oppressors - just different faces.

[NOTE: Revolution - from the world revolve. So a revolution does not mean inherent change, they are generally just face-lifts. Evolution speaks of inherent change in the way it was done. To quote a Sages: "That the only form of evolution is to one in which you become better than your previous self".]

Notice here, I do not say that they do not affect the spiritual realm, but perhaps not in the manner and due to the events as we believe. As the system is continuous, or recursive - in that the every event is based on a sequence of events that occurred so that the seminal event could manifest. One cannot have vision without an eye, and a "brain" or perceptor of some nature that can "see" the vision. In other words, it has both the mechanism/technology available to see, and the perceptive capability to perceive and cognite (in some meaningful fashion) what is being seen. The one is purely technical, or empirical, the other is uncertain. To the materialist, it is the chemicals, or microtubules, or some other physical measurable event that occurs... whereas to the imaginative, there seems to be another element involved that we cannot measure with our empirical measurements, and is uncertain as to where exactly it is situation (in the brain - or elsewhere) - this we realm of spirit, or soul.
