## Chapter Outline

1. Change the narrative (4D – 3D)
2. Language transference (angels -> quantum -> 4d)
3. Multi-dimensionality
   a) Dimensions
   b) all action occurs @ 1D, “the point”. What is the point (event, conversation, etc.).
   c) Sex – the erotic nature of the universe.
   Pt (masc.), encountering receptor (fem). {Remembering, that this is the process. In order to have a point that is penetrating, one has to have a point that is receiving too.}
   They touch at a “pt” (or “collection” of points – which form, then, an object or event). Millions of pts of interaction occurring at any and every moment, extending from the center.
4. Numbers (0 – 9 [10], 1 – 10 [11] -> 12?)
5. Geometry (shapes, 6, 12, etc)
6. Space, topology
7. Quantum
8. Imaginary numbers
9. Transcendental states (bliss, nirvana, enlightenment)

## Characteristics of Dimensions

1. Every dimension contains within it every lower dimension.
2. There are an infinite amount of projections of any higher dimensional object onto a lower dimension.
3. The basic “reality” that is experienced in any dimension is the point of interaction, what we often call the “here and now”, a singularity&mdash;the (present) moment.
4. Every object/event is made up of a set of points.

Q: Is a higher dimensional point equivalent to a lower dimensional point?

Each point can be represented exactly in every dimension. (As it goes up it would increase in dimensionality, but still be a point - albeit an _n_ dimensional one.
But a point has “emptiness” in it, that can get filled, and so it would remain where it was, perhaps made more dense by all the energy from the upper dimension that has now been collected at that point. This is an interesting way of looking at the density of our dimensions. As one descends, it becomes more and more dense.

5. The point is invariant, irrespective of dimension.

It just takes more variables, more reference information, to locate the point in higher dimensions.

6. Every N dimensional space has a N+1 brane or skin that “encloses” it. A soccer ball, for example.

## Descriptions of Dimensions

### 1D

It is, a moment, an event. Generally represented by a circle. The only information is its position. It signifies the existence of something; its "first" emergence, or manifestation thereof. The point, or tangent of something.

But that brings us to immediately recognise that if there is 1, a something, there has to be something "else", even if that other is the NOT of the previous. More often, in order for there to be any continuation, any recognition, there has to be at least one other. Basically there cannot be 1 that emerges without their being at least 2&mdash;the 1 that emerged and the whatever it emerged from!

### 2D

Represents a this and a that; an other appears, thus there is an awareness of self because of existence of other.
Now we have length & breadth but no depth

### 3D

This could be indicative of a relation between two (at least). It introduces the aspect of depth, thus perspective. Also of reproduction&mdash;out of the two comes the one.

### 4D

Represented from our 3D space as the imaginary number. Which has a different space/time continuum. It manifests as effects in our space. Also known as the angelic realm, also the imaginary realm.

In relation to 3D, would be able to “see" and pass through walls. Just as a 4d mage could “see the future”, similar to "passing through walls".

A being, or consciousness, fully embodied in a dimension, is very effective within it. One finds man different examples of this. Someone who ignores or denies their 4d consciousness (what the Kabbalists call their _neshama_), will be incredibly efficient in the 3d. One who embraces, and focuses, only on the elements of his 2d existence – separating the world into recognisable/unrecognisable, useful/useless, good or bad will be horribly efficient in the short term, but woeful in the long term.

### 4 worlds

The 4 worlds of the Kabbalah, with also the 4 levels of interpretation of the writings, could be interpreted as dimensions, expressed in other terms.

The 4 levels of "worlds" in the multi-world theory.

## Summary

1 -> pt
2 -> line - relationship between 2 points in space
3 -> plane/field - encompassing the 2 original points, and their relationship, thus producing shapes. Is the place where the points replicate/reproduce. This is the expression of the points connecting with other already existing elements.

## Our Journey to/from Infinity

Start from 1. Is that really the beginning? Our narrative can only begin with the existence of something – at minimum 1.
The paradoxical nature of this statement is that actually, in order for there to be any narrative, we need 2 – the binary, the duality, this and that. 1 is insufficient as there is nothing to know of the existence of the singularity, if that is all that there is. One could refer to it as a closed loop. Selfish, self-centred and narcissistic. Thus in order for anything to “exist”, there needs to be 2 – itself and the other, the other that can relate or receive the narrative, the one we call the “witness”.

The accepted wisdom was that everything arose from the One, and everything is reducible to the One. Oneness, which is, was and always will be the Source of Everything. It was our brothers from the Ancient Middle East who alerted us to the existence of a state before the One. A place from which the ‘I’ had not yet emerged. They called it naught, Ø, the empty set – a place where even the one does not exist. This upset the monotheistic religions, who had battled the many, reducing it to the primal One, until we accepted the incorporeal into our language.

## Human

> We are living in 3d space with 4d consciousness, moving along a 2d vector. But are descended from some 5d+ super-consciousness, or root soul.

We are 4d (consciousness) beings having a 3d (real/mundane) experience. Or having an experience of living in a 3d reality.  
Thus there is something always missing, something that we are always seeking, and the only way we can find it is by accepting the 4d consciousness that we are capable of accessing.

Animals for instance; amoral people; those that live in a world of polarities, of right and wrong, good and evil. If one takes all you have to calculate for 3 dimensions into account, while another is only working in 2, the latter will be able to arrive at a decision sooner, as it can even implement it more swiftly, while you are hamstrung by the extra dimension you are taking into account. However, he is hampered by the inaccurate assessment that will haunt him all through his actions. This is due to propagation of error, which, as an approximation of the reality of the event, will be inevitable.

### Interactions

It is the difference between the one who says, “This is in my way. If I push all else aside, I can continue”, verses the other that considers the effect upon the one being pushed aside. And thus does not deal with the situation in the most efficient way in the moment, but could fumble at the critical point.
