## Thoughts on Universal "symbols"

Universal symbols are those symbols which describe the world around us. They could consist of base symbols that need to be combined to express the world symbolically&mdash;as in language. However, certain languages are able to describe the fundamental laws and principle of the universe more accurately. The modern example of this is our queen of science, mathematics.

I would like to describe mathematics as the representation of the creations of the world and the natural laws that sustain her.

Could not there be other languages, ancient ones, that described the universe, perhaps from a slightly different perspective, and possibly in a more circumspect manner&mdash;with a far different vocabulary both of language and experience, as well as a more limited vocabulary&mdash;yet were as accurate in their description of the world around us. Perhaps their descriptions served a different purpose; perhaps their goal, and desired outcome was different?

## Another symbolic language

Could we not think of the types of quanta of the Standard Theory as specific representations of the letters/symbols/characters/glyphs that form the universe?

Atoms then could be the words of nature, molecules the sentences. Humans would be a tome, like a symphony. The strings of string theory would be like the sounds from a violin that awakens spirit to begin to dance the dance of embodiment.
