## Armageddon (TolNet)

Do you realise what is happening? It is the time of Armageddon, when the baby will be torn from the arms of the screaming mother, and the child will not be able to be with his parent when the time comes for her to pass over; when congerations will no longer be able to meet and share in communial gatherings to pray to their gods and their ancestors.

It is strange that the story of the Exodus of the Jewish people from their bondage in Egypt starts off with the Pharoah's refusal to allow them to go into the wilderness to pray to their Gods. It is like a Christian not being given the day off for Xmas - oh, darn, I forgot, that already happens in the Christian countries themselves!

We will become the pariah's of society, the hated, and the feared. For we are not "innoculated" against the dreaded disease of non-compliance to the regime. What regime am I talking of here? It is the medical regime - science and health seem to be on a path to extermination. This medical health regime had become a cancer on the body social. It only knows it own needs and appetites - driven by our fear of death, and the need for control of our destiny (another death avoiding strategy). However, to avoid death is to avoid life. Death is an intrinsic aspect of life, and cannot be seperated. When your time comes... we say. And now this "scientific revolution" (against who is science rebelling? It seems, in the end, against G-d. Science believes [yes - believes, like the religious zealot believes] that we are here to improve on G-d's design, although it does not acknowledge the existence of G-d, claiming that there is no emperical proof of G-d. It is like the idiot looking at the elephant in the room, and asking "What elephant". Is it so big that we cannot see it? Is it not so obvious that it does not, nay cannot be proven. Just as the question of whether the set of all sets is itself as set, the obvious reality in which we are born is a prededermined environment. It was here long before I was born, and will be here long after I am dead. So, It Itself is a "something", even if just an existence. Though, if it has taken us, with our vaunted intelligence so many "thousands" of years to understand the little of what is going on around us that we do at present understand, whatever inhabits this universe, and designed it so explicitly, must "know" something we don't, something fundamental to this existence. And as such, is at the very least, a superior form of intelligence.)

## Mekubalim (Story)

We are the living messengers of an ancient race of _Mekubalim_. We are the receivers, and now we come to deliver our message. It matters not to us whether you hear us and act accordingly or not. For we will continue, as the when we have nothing to receive and our awaiting our next task, we watch, and thus are known as the _Neshemot_ or Watchers. For many centuries much of our knowledge was hidden, and transmitted in secret to a select few. As it is said, "Speak of the Secrets to one who is learned in all the texts, but never reveal to two". With the advent of the written word, and much of the knowledge was written down, as the principle of Truth reigns supreme, and both can never lie. Thus the truth will always hide in plain sight. So it was with the messengers of the _Mekubalim_, and those who had been trained to read the codes, knew how the disguises were formed, and how to navigate the pathways that our people had placed for us. Thus we could recognise one another just by the way a certain phrase was uttered, or a sentence interpreted. It was like the dancing bears, or the "four-twenty friendly" of the Grateful Dead entourage. During this time, and in various guises our wisdom permeated various cultures, and geographical areas, and laid seeds that would sprout when the environment was conducive to its emergence. Again and again we have called to you. Sometimes in small groups, sometimes in nation states comprising hundreds of millions of people. In this time, and in this place, we begin to transmit once again.

In the beginning it will be brief expose's. According to your reaction, and to your ability to comprehend what is being said, the appropriate doors will open.

There is one more thing. There are two aspects to this check-up. The first is the emperical the second in the imaginative.

We are not healers. There are those who are called to heal, sometimes they are doctors, sometimes they are medicine people. There are those who are teachers, or community leaders. We are not any of those. We are keepers of the Tree of Life. For without the Tree, there is no life.
As we know there are 3 trees in the garden. [Actually four, but the 4th is a secret tree, and because it is secret, we will no longer speak of it]. The Tree of Life, and the Tree of Death, and the Tree of Knowledge (of Good & Evil). And what is evil to the being conscious of being alive? It's death or anything associated with that, of course. Therefore there are those who work for the Tree of Life, and those who work for the Tree of Death. And the two are eternal enemies. We simply say, that good is to emulate G!d, and evil is to turn one's back on the Divine expression that not only are we surrounded by, but are also a part of.

```
Personal Question: If we are G-d's psyche having a Divine experience, what is G-d's need for all this pain and suffering? What does He get from all of this insane hurting of one another?
