## Chapter 30

## Annulment of vows

[N: Interesting concept of vows here. It seems that it only refers here to vows of privation. If one vowed to eat chocolate every day for a month... that is not included in this discussion - or so I understand.]{.note}
v3]
For a man: "according to whatever came out of his mouth, he shall do." (v3)

For a woman:

- if in her father's house: (v4)
  - if he hinders her on the day of her vow,
    - they are annulled
    - else they stand
- if betrothed (v7)
  - if her husband hinders her on the day of her vow,
    - they are annulled
    - else they stand
- if divorced or widowed (v10)
  - whatever she prohibited upon herself will remain upon her.

Repeated again, and in greater detail:
[N: v11+ cannot refer to the divorced woman, for in v12, it refers to her husband, who is either dead, or has divorced her. The only case is of a divorced who is still living in her husband's house - however, if she is divorced from him, he is no longer her husband.]

-if in her husband's house, (v11)

- he heard and  (v12)
  - remained silent,
    - her vows stand
  - if he revokes them on that day,
    - they are annulled. (v13)

Now, the general rule:

<div class='box'>
 <div class='columns is-multiline'>
    <div class='column is-half'>
      14 Any vow or any binding oath of self affliction, her husband can either uphold it or revoke it.
   </div>
   <div dir="rtl" class='column'>

      יד. כָּל־נֵ֛דֶר וְכָל־שְׁבֻעַ֥ת אִסָּ֖ר לְעַנֹּ֣ת נָ֑פֶשׁ אִישָׁ֥הּ יְקִימֶ֖נּוּ וְאִישָׁ֥הּ יְפֵרֶֽנּוּ:
   </div>
   <div class='column is-half'>
     15 However, if her husband remained silent from day to day, he has upheld all the vows and prohibitions she has assumed; he has upheld them since he remained silent on the day he heard it.
     </div>
   <div dir="rtl" class='column'>

       טו. וְאִם־הַֽחֲרֵשׁ֩ יַֽחֲרִ֨ישׁ לָ֥הּ אִישָׁהּ֘ מִיּ֣וֹם אֶל־יוֹם֒ וְהֵקִים֙ אֶת־כָּל־נְדָרֶ֔יהָ א֥וֹ אֶת־כָּל־אֱסָרֶ֖יהָ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָלֶ֑יהָ הֵקִ֣ים אֹתָ֔ם כִּי־הֶֽחֱרִ֥שׁ לָ֖הּ בְּי֥וֹם שָׁמְעֽוֹ:
   </div>
   <div class='column is-half'>
     16 If he revokes them after having heard [them], he shall bear her iniquity.  
   </div>
   <div dir="rtl" class='column'>

   </div>
   <div class='column is-half'>
     17 These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses concerning a man and his wife, a father and his daughter, in her youth, while in her father's house.

## Chapter 31

## Revenge on the Midianites

We begin with:

<div class='box'>
 <div class='columns'>
   <div class='column'>
     1 The Lord spoke to Moses saying,
   </div>
   <div dir="rtl" class='column'>

     א. וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־משֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹֽר:
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

"Take revenge on the Midianites". Moses armed a thousand from each tribe. They killed every male, and the five kings of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba ([אֶת־אֱוִ֤י וְאֶת־רֶ֨קֶם֙ וְאֶת־צ֤וּר וְאֶת־חוּר֙ וְאֶת־רֶ֔בַע חֲמֵ֖שֶׁת מַלְכֵ֣י מִדְיָ֑ן]{dir="rtl"}). They took all the women and children prisoners, and plundered everything else. Then they burnt all their cities and their castles. (v10)

Upon their return, they faced the wrath of Moses. (v14)

"Did you allow the females to live?" He demanded. "They were the same ones who were involved with the children of Israel on Balaam's advice to betray the Lord over the incident of Peor, resulting in a plague among the congregation of the Lord." (v16)

"So now kill every male child, and every woman who can lie intimately with a man. And all the young girls who have no experience of intimate relations with a man, you may keep alive for yourselves."

Then they were told to camp outside for seven days and cleanse themselves, as well as all "garments, articles, any goat product and wooden articles". Only the metals - "for whatever is used in fire, shall pass through fire and be cleansed".

Now, the Lord commands Moses to take a count of the plunder, to divide it equally between the people and the warriors who went to battle. In addition, the warriors shall pay a tax of one soul for every 500 from the people, the cattle, donkeys and the sheep and give it to Elazar the Kohen. The people shall pay one part out of 50 of the people, the cattle, donkeys, sheep _and all the animals_ and give it to the Levites.

Now the count of the plunder:

- sheep 675,000
- cattle 72,000
- donkeys 61,000
- virgins 32,000

Warrior's portion:

- sheep 337,500 - the Lord's tax was 675
- cattle 36,000 - the Lord's tax was 72
- donkeys 30,500 - the Lord's tax was 61
- virgins 16,000 - the Lords tax was 32

People's portion:

- sheep 337,500
- cattle 36,000
- donkeys 30,500
- virgins 16,000

Moses removed one part out of fifty.

### The commanders' offering (v48)

"We won our battle with no one missing. We therefore wish to bring an offering to the Lord. They dedicated 16,750 shekels worth of gold.

[N: It mentions here that the dedication was from the commanders of the 1000's and the 100's. (v52 & 53) Then there is a strange statement inserted here (v53). It says "The soldiers had seized spoils for themselves ([אַנְשֵׁי֙ הַצָּבָ֔א בָּֽזְז֖וּ אִ֥ישׁ לֽוֹ]{dir="rtl"})]{.note} "The land of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, and Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, ([עֲטָר֤וֹת וְדִיבֹן֙ וְיַעְזֵ֣ר וְנִמְרָ֔ה וְחֶשְׁבּ֖וֹן וְאֶלְעָלֵ֑ה וּשְׂבָ֥ם וּנְב֖וֹ וּבְעֹֽן]{dir="rtl"}) the Lord struck down and is a land for livestock. Let this land be given to your servants as a heritage." (v5)

"Will your people go to war while you settle here?" Moses asked.
He reprimands them for discouraging the Bnei Israel from crossing over to the Promised Land. (v8) He reminds them of the punishment of the previous generation for being afraid to enter the land after the spies returned with their report.(v13)\

They promise to come and fight with the people as soon as they have settled their families. [N: They say "we will build sheepfolds and cities for our children." (v16) But how long will that take?] And they will not return until the land is settled.(v18)

Moses agrees to the terms. He tells the elders and leaders. If they keep their promise, they may have the land they asked for. If not, they will have an inheritance in the Holy Land.

Now follows an explicit description of the land that was given them.

<div class='box'>
 <div class='columns'>
   <div class='column'>
     33 Moses gave the descendants of Gad and the descendants of Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan the land together with its cities within borders, the cities of the surrounding territory.
   </div>
   <div dir="rtl" class='column'>
     לג. וַיִּתֵּ֣ן לָהֶ֣ם | משֶׁ֡ה לִבְנֵי־גָד֩ וְלִבְנֵ֨י רְאוּבֵ֜ן וְלַֽחֲצִ֣י | שֵׁ֣בֶט | מְנַשֶּׁ֣ה בֶן־יוֹסֵ֗ף אֶת־מַמְלֶ֨כֶת֙ סִיחֹן֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ הָֽאֱמֹרִ֔י וְאֶ֨ת־מַמְלֶ֔כֶת ע֖וֹג מֶ֣לֶךְ הַבָּשָׁ֑ן הָאָ֗רֶץ לְעָרֶ֨יהָ֙ בִּגְבֻלֹ֔ת עָרֵ֥י הָאָ֖רֶץ סָבִֽיב:
   </div>
 </div>
</div>

And:

The descendents of Gad (בְנֵי־גָ֔ד) built Dibon (דִּיבֹ֖ן), Ataroth (עֲטָרֹ֑ת), and Aroer (עֲרֹעֵֽר). And Atroth Shophan (עַטְרֹ֥ת שׁוֹפָ֛ן), Jazer (יַעְזֵ֖ר), and Jogbehah (וְיָגְבְּהָֽה). And Beth Nimrah (בֵּ֥ית נִמְרָ֖ה) and Beth Haran (בֵּ֣ית הָרָ֑ן),
fortified cities and sheepfolds.

The descendants of Reuben (בְנֵ֤י רְאוּבֵן֙) built Heshbon (חֶשְׁבּ֖וֹן), Elealeh (אֶלְעָלֵ֑א), and Kiriathaim (קִרְיָתָֽיִם). And Nebo (נְב֞וֹ) and Baal Meon (בַּ֧עַל מְע֛וֹן ), their names having been changed, and Sibmah (שִׂבְמָ֑ה).
they were called with names of the names of the cities they built.

The children of Machir the son of Manasseh (מָכִ֧יר בֶּן־מְנַשֶּׁ֛ה) went to Gilead (גִּלְעָ֖דָ) and conquered it, driving out the Amorites (הָֽאֱמֹרִ֥י) who were there.  Jair the son of Manasseh (יָאִ֤יר בֶּן־מְנַשֶּׁה֙) went and conquered their hamlets, and called them the hamlets of Jair. Nobah ([נֹ֣בַח]{dir="rtl"}) went and conquered Kenath (קְנָ֖ת) and its surrounding villages, and called it Nobah, after his name.

 <div class='columns'>
   <div class='column'>
     55 But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the Land from before you, then those whom you leave over will be as spikes in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the land in which you settle.
