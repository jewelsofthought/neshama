## Death of Aaron's sons and the Yom Kippur service

The death of Nadab and Abihu is mentioned in conjunction with the chapter on Yom Kippur because:

> Just as Yom Kippur brings atonement, so the death of the righteous brings atonement &mdash;(Yerushalmi Yoma 1:1).

**Note**: This is a difficult idea to swallow&mdash;that a blessing for the righteous is to die young? Perhaps from the perspective of G-d, this makes sense, but from the perspective of the human...{.note}

Yom kippur is [עֵת רצון]{dir="rtl"} and is thus an opportune time for atonement. When a righteous person dies and his soul ascends to the world of souls, the other righteous souls in Heaven  rejoice at his coming. This good feeling above can inspire a spirit of forgiveness and atonement to the righteous person's surviviors on earth. This is the connection to Yom Kippur.

However, and this is crucial, both Yom Kippur and the death of the righteous bring atonement only on one condition. Yom Kippur atones only for people who recognise it as a holy day and treat it as such; those to whom it is merely a day to refrain from food and work, but without a spiriual dimension, do not find atonement on Yom Kippur. Similarly, those who do not honour the righteous in life don't benefit from their ascent to Heaven in death.

- [פָּרֹֹכֶת]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _Curtain_. The Curtain in the Sanctuary that divided the Holy from the Holy of Holies. See _Exodus_ 26.31.
- [בַּד]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _Linen_. The whiteness of linen is symbolic of forgiveness; and the material itself symbolises the Heavenly service of the angels who are described as wearing linen, as it were (_Ezekiel_ 9.2). The four white vestments symbolise the four camps of angels that serve G-d (_R' Bachya_).

16:17] Atonement

<div class="note">

**Note**: If priests owned no land and lived from the proceeds of the temple, how could Aaron have a bull for his own sin-offering?

It says that he bought the bull from his own money (as opposed to the sin-offering for the people, that was purchased with the community fund). However, the same question arises then: Where did his "own" money come from, if he did not own land or property?

The concern that arises from that is for 600,000+ population, and cattle to spare, what was the food for all these animals (because there were goats and sheep as well)? There was no grain that they grew or could grow being in the desert. There is no mention of manna from heaven for the animals, so my question remains: "What did the animals eat? Where did their food come from?"
</div>

## Confession

The primary atonement of an offering is effected by the blood service, not by the confession (see below 17:11), but the confession is an essential part of repentence, and hence of atonement (1:4, _Yoma_ 5a).

n16:14] Blood ritual

[וְהִזָּה בְאֶצְבָעוֹ]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _And sprinkle with his forefinger_. The Kohen Gadol would dip his right index finger into the blood and sprinkle it eighth times toward the Ark with a whiplike motion. He would aim upward once and downward seven times, but it was not necesssary for the blood actually to touch the Ark.

It is one of G-d's greatest gifts that He permits a person to erase the sins of his past so that he can being a better life, a life unhampered by the corrosive effects of past sins. Such a new beginning is not possible unless the sinner has repented by confronting his misdeeds, acknowledging them, and sincerely resolving to change. This is represented by confession.

The power of confession lies in the fact that it is not merely a recitation of a formula, but a sincere declaration of remorse. People are loath to acknowledge a fact that hurts them more than they can bear.

**Note**: The concept of confession (_vidui_) regarding Yom
Kippur is similar to the concept of recapitulation.{.note}

n16:17] Solitude

[וְכָל אָדָם]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _Any person_. During the Kohen Gadol's inner service, not even angels were permitted to enter the Tabernacle (Jerusalem Talmud, _Yoma_ 1:5). It was necessary for the Kohen Gadol to approach G-d, as it were, in utter and complete privacy, without any intermediary between them, and that <mark>the Divine blessing was most effacious when it is received in quiet solitude</mark>.

n16:17] Atonement

This refers to the incense service, which atones for the sin of [לשׁון הרע]{dir="rtl} [_lashon hara_], _evil tongue_, i.e., slander and gossip.. The Sages say that incense &mdash; a service that is performed quietly &mdash; comes to atone for _lashon hara_, that is spoken stealthily, behind someone's back (_Yoma_ 44a). It is known as the elevation offering, and atones for improper thoughts (n24).

[וְכִפֶּר]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _And provide atonement_. First the Kohen Gadol recited the confession for the sins of the nation as set forth in verse 21. Then Kohen Gadol gained atonement by pronouncing the confession for his own and his family's, i.e., household's, sins (_Rashi; Yoma_ 36b).

The text of his confession was:

  "I beg of You, **HaShem**, I have acted wickedly, rebelled and sinned before You, I and my household. I beg of You, **HaShem**, forgive now the wicked acts, rebellions and sins, for I have acted wickedly, rebelled and sinned before You, I and my household, as it is written in the Torah of Your servant Moses (16:30): _For on this day he shall provide atonement for you..."_ (Mishnah _Yoma_ 3.8).
  
  <div class="note">

  **Note**: If his confession would be more personal, specifying actual deeds that he was asking for forgiveness for, it might carry much more weight. Imagine!
  
  Even verse 21 does not go into any specifics regarding the sins of Israel, but just a description of the ritual. What if it was preceded by a public confession of sins of the nation. What would those look like, I wonder?

  </div>

n16:8,20-22] Azazel

[לְאְַזָאזֵל]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _For Azazel_. The name symbolises [עַז]{dir="rtl"}, _strong_, and [אֵל]{dir="rtl"}, _mighty_. It also symbolises

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    Every person must choose between good and evil. No one has the luxury of being neutral. Those who do not choose to move toward holiness are inevitably pushing themselves toward a wasteland of spiritual destruction.
  </p>
  <figcaption>&mdash;(R' Hirsh)</figcaption>
</figure>

This preoccupation with evil teaches us that it is not enough to be sure that we have G-d's forgiveness and love&mdash;we must also recognise and repel the hostile forces that surround and tempt us. (_Zohar_) Thus the scapegoat is a reminder that G-d wants us to guard against the threats of our enemies by recognising their existence and appeasing them.

n12-13] **The Incense Service**.

The Yom Kippur incense service was unique in several ways, as described in Mishnah _Yoma_ 4:4. Among others, it was performed only once a year, and it was performed in the Holy of Holies, the sacred area of the Temple that not even the Kohen  Gadol could enter at any other time. The incense mixture was the same as that used all year round, except ground "extra-fine".

Very briefly, the Kohen Gadol would scoop a shovelful of burning coals from the outside Altar, and then fill his hands with the specially ground incense, which he would place in ladle. With the heavier shovel in his right hand and the lighter ladle in his left, he would enter the Holy of Holies, where he would pour the incense into the fire and remain there until the incense coloud rose and covered the Ark. For a fuller description see Mishnah _Yoma_ ch. 4-5.

**Question**: The incense service happens once a year. All the (animal) sacrifices took place inside the Mishkan, but on the other side of the Parochet?{.note}

n16:21] [וְסָמַךְ אַהְַרֹן]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _Aaron shall lean_. As noted in 1:4, the individual whol brings an offering must lean upon it and confess the sin for which he brings it.

n16:30] [כּי־בַיּוֹם יְכַפֵּר]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _For on this day he shall provide atonment_. The day's sacrificial service can only serve to ameliorate one's sins and make G-d receptive to one's personal repentence. Then it is up to the sinner to improve himself and become worthy of G-d's forgivenetss. Only through personal repentence and self-cleansing can a person be "cleansed of all his sins before G-d". (_Sforno_)

Yom Kippur provides atonement only to those who repent and purify themselves before they come to G-d to request forgiveness. If they do so, then G-d Himself will cleanse them (_Kli Yakar_).

From this verse, R' Elazar ben Azariah expounds that repentence and the Yom Kippur service can effect atonement only for the sins _before **HaShem**_, meaning sins against G-d, which have not harmed other people. But if one has sinned against his fellows, G-d will not forgive him until he first appeases the person whom he has wronged (_Sifra_, _Yoma_ 85b)

n16:30] [יְכַפֵּר...תִּטְהָרוּ]{di"rtl"} &mdash; _Provide atonement ... be purifed_.

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    There are two aspects to the removal of sin: atonement and purifying. When someone transgresses G-d's will, the sinner earns punishment for disobeying G-d, and, in addition, his resistance to further sins becomes weaker, because sinfulness becomes a habit, and one someone commits a misdeed, it becomes more likely that he will sin again. Atonement removes the liability to punishment, but to the extent that the habitual sinner has become a worse person, the effect of the sin remains. From this encrustation of evil, the sinner must be purified.:

n16:31] [שַׁבָּת שַׁבָּתון]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _A Sabbath of complete rest_.

## Chapter 17

n17:1-9] Service outside the Tabernacle

The general rule is that offerings must be slaughtered and their service performed in the Sanctuary area, while non-consecrated animals may be slaughtered anywhere _except_ in Sanctuary area. In the case of offering, they may not be offered anywhere, even if the service is dedicated to G-d.

**Question**: What is a _consecrated_ animal?{.note}

[יכפר...תטהרו]{dir="rtl"} &mdash;

**Note**: This is an interesting segment. The call to sacrifice only at the _Mishkan_ is one to prevent the continuation of the worship of pagan idols, which took place in the fields and in the homes of the people.{.note}

n17:2] [זֶה הַדָּבָר]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _That is the matter (lit. word)_. Moses conveyed the commandments to Israel in G-d's own words [and then elaborated upon them according to the teachings of the Oral Law (_Chofetz Chaim_)]. This is true for the entire Torah (_Sifra_).

**Question**: What and how was the Oral Torah transmitted to Moshe? {.note}

n17:4] [דם יחשׁב]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _It shall be considered as bloodshed_.

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>

    When a person kills animals without a legitimate purpose, he allows himself to be influenced by the same bloody characteristics that can cause people to commit murder. Thus, his act is _considered as bloodshed_, sin it is his bloody instincts that have taken control of him.
  </p>
  <figcaption>&mdash;(Kli Yakar)</figcaption>
</figure>

n17:4] [ונכרת האישׁ ההוא]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _And that man shall be cut off_.

What is interesting here is the note on the difference between using [האישׁ]{dir="rtl"} as opposed to [הנפשׁ]{dir="rtl"}. The former implies that the _Kares_ will be one of an early death, but not that he will lose his place in the World to Come. However, if one uses the word _soul_, [נפשׁ]{dir="rtl"}, instead, it means that his _soul_ will be cut off from the World to Come

n17:5] [אשׁר הם זבחים]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _That they have been slaughtering_.

This stringent punishment for this sin was necessary to break the ingrained habit of slaughtering offerings wherever it was convenient for them to set up an Altar, a practice that had been followed from the days of Noah and the Patriarchs.

n17:7] [ולא־יזבּחוּ אוד]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _They shall no longer slaughter_.

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ולא־יִזבְּחוּ עוד את־זבחיהם לַשׂעִירים אשׁר הם זנים אחריהם
</p>
<p>They shall no longer slaughter their offerings to the demons (of the field) after whom they stray.
</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>

    The people are no longer to follow the practice they learned in Egypt of offering sacrifices to the [שׂעירים]{dir="rtl"}, _demons_ of the fields, after which they used to _stray_.
  </p>
  <figcaption>&mdash;(Ibn Ezra)</figcaption>
</figure>

[זֹנִים]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _Stray_

Someone who worships demons, thinking that they have independent power that must be appeased and that can benefit their worshippers, is _straying_ from G-d, Who alone should be the focus of all human service (_Ibn Ezra_).

## Blood

n17:10] [כּל־דּם]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _Any blood_. Blood from any and all animals and fowl is forbidden (_Kereisos_ 20b).

n17:11] [כּי־נפשׁ הבשׂר בּדם הוא]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _For the soul of the flesh is in the blood_. Because life is dependent on the blood. The life giving force is borne by the blood(_Sforno_).

n17:14] [דָּמוֹ בּנַפשׁוֹ הוּא]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _It's blood represents its life_ [lit., _its blood is in its soul_]. _Ramban_ renders _the life of the any being is the blood in its body_.

n17:16] [וְנָשׂא עוֹנוֹ]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _He shall bear his iniquity_. This always refers to _kares_ (_Rashi_; _Sifra_).

**Note**: Interesting to note that vaccinations have become a medium by which our blood is being attacked.{.note}

## Immorality

The Torah sets forth the prohibitions, in line with the principle that [אין עונשׁים אלא אם כּן מזהירין]{dir="rtl"}, _they do not punish unless they give a warning_.

n18:2] [אני ה’]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _I am **HaShem**_

Normally Moses' face was covered with a veil, because the people could not tolerate the holiness on his face (_Exodus_ 34:29-35). When he conveyed the word of G-d to the people, however, he would remove the veil, so it would be clear to the people that they were hearing the Divine command. (_Ramban_)

Just as the nation cannot exist without acknowledgement that **HaShem** is our G-d, so it must accept upun itself the laws of sexual purity contained in this chapter.

n18:3] [מצרים...כנען]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _Egypt...Canaan_

These two lands were the most morally decadent... G-d warns the Jews to be alert to the challenge of their past and future homes because people must be especially alert to the lures of their environment. It is tempting to justify sin on the grounds that "everyone does it".

The apparent implication is that there is no harm in imitating the foul deeds of nations that are not evil &mdash; but sin is a progressive process: "Ordinary transgressions inevitably lead to more serious ones, until the sinner descends to the morass of Canaan and Egypt. We must scrupulously avoid enen the first step on the road to corruption (_R' Moshe Feinstein_)

[וּבְחֻקֹּתֵיהֶם]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _Their traditions_

We are enjoined to avoid the deeply ingrained customs of the nations such as attending theatres and stadiums to watch gladiators. _Sifra_ add that the prohibition includes attempts to make oneself look like the nations and imitate their promiscuous practices.

The exhortation not to follow the traditions of the nations is couched in terms of [חֻקֹתֶיהֶם]{dir="rtl"}, literally _their decrees_, the same term that is used to describe the commandments of the Torah that defy human logic. It is common for people to think that a nation's culture is predicated upon a set of rational norms, and that any "civilised" person must accept them, unless he is demented. The truth is, however, that culture is an accumulation of practices, many of which are not in the least logical. This explains how different societies have widely divergent cultures, and how so many of them can consider other societies to be comical, primitive, or even barbaric. The difference between Judaism's "decrees" and the "decrees" of other societies is simply that the former are G-d given, while the latter are devised by man and canonised by his habits. Therefore, the Torah cautions us to avoid falling into the habit-forming, mind-molding trap of imitating the practices of alien societies (_R' Shlomo Wolbe_).

**Note**: Firstly, have to accept that G-d would and has given His decrees to us. But barring that, to jostle with the possibility that the Creator has embedded, somewhere in His Creation, His actual decrees. That is our task to decipher this code, and realise His actual decrees. That the Torah could have been given as a key (or blueprint) to that code, a way of entering into that realm of exploration, is the basis on which our lives are founded.{.note}

_R' Hirsch_ (_Horeb_ para. 505) summarised the laws of this commandment: "You may imitate the nations in which you live in everything which has been adopted by them on rational grounds, and not on grounds which belong to their religion, or for forbidden or immoral purposes. You may not, therefore, join in celebrating their holy days, or observe customs which have their basis in their religious views. You must not, however, do anything which will disturb their holy days or mar their festival spirit; and do not parade your non-participation in their holy days in a manner that might arouse animosity."

n18:4] [משׁפטי...חֻקֹתי]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _My laws...My decrees._

_Laws_ are practices that would be dictated by reason even if they were not dictated by the Torah.

_Decrees_ are those that are unfathomable by human intelligence. Many have noted that חק, is derived from [חקק]{dir="rtl"}, to engrave. A person commits himself to _chok_ he cannot understand because the inner _tzelem Elokim_ (_image of G-d_) within the Jew recognises that there are truths above the limited human intellect. Many of life's important decisions are based on considerations that may be called a "light from within", considerations that reflect the person's true inner self... For example, no law is as universally accepted as that against murder, yet "logic" can permit people to nibble at the fringes of the sanctity of life, by arguing that fetus is not a true life, or that suffering or impaired people are unworthy of life or that human life is no more worthy of preservation than animal life.

n18:6-18] **Forbidden relationships**

The laws governing sexual relationships are the key to holiness.

These following verses detail all the different forms of sexual relationships that are forbidden. All incest is forbidden. Homosexuality and bestiality are called abominations. Sex while menstruating is forbidden, and others.

> _Wherever one finds safeguards of chastity, there one finds holiness_ (Vayikra Rabbah_ 24:6).

n18:6] [אני ה’]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; Immorality becomes the norm of sophisticated people. To such people, the strictures of the Torah may seem like inexplicable decrees.

n18:7] [עֵרְוָה]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _nakedness_ or _shame_. Immorality "exposes" something that should properly be covered, and can be rendered as _shame_.

n18:21] **Molech**

Molech was an idol whose worship was prevalent in Canaan. It is mentioned here as an example fo the idol worship that made the inhabitants of the land so contemptible in G-d's eyes (_Ramban_). Its worship involved children; like immorality, it demonstrated people's readiness to debase future generations to satisfy their own passions.

Both the idol worshipper and the person who engages in immorality are similar in that they are treacherous to the one entitled to their loyalty. The concept of jealousy refers to the outrage one feels when someone takes a thing that is his (or hers). The Torah used the term to describe G-d's anger when someone transfers his reverence from G-d to an idol, and also that of a husband when his wife is unfaithful (_Numbers_ 5:14) [or a wife when her husband is unfaithful]{.note}

_Sforno_ explains that the Jew who serves Molech may bring his animal-offerings to the G-d's Temple, but his children &mdash; who are most precious to him &mdash; he brings to Molech, thus demonstrating conclusively where his loyalties lie.

n18:22] **Abomination**

[תּועֵבָה]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _An abomination_

18:22] "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman..."

n18:25] [ותקא]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _And_..._disgorged_. It is the nature of prophecy to look to the inner spiritual values that determine future events.
