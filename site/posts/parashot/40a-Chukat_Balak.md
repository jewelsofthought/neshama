Balak

1. Balak, King of Moab
2. Angel & Donkey
3. Balaam's "curse"
   - 3 times
   - end of days
   - coming of the Messiah
4. Peor
   - daughters of Moab
   - Midianite princess
   - Plague
   - Pinchas kills them
   - Plague stops

- This is the decree (chok) of the Torah... (Numbers 19:2)

This phrase can be understood in two ways. On one level it means that this--the law of the Red Heifer—is the ultimate "decree", the most supra-rational of all the Torah's precepts. A deeper meaning is that all of Torah is, in essence, divine decree. It is only that with many of the mitzvot, the supra-rational divine will come "clothed" in garments of reason.

(Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi)

Ritual of the Red Heifer:

- Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring to you a red heifer (19:2)

- Perfectly red unblemished cow, (not more than 2 hairs not red)
  - upon which no yoke was laid.
- (Elazar), the Kohen, slaughters it outside the camp
- Sprinkle its blood with his finger toward the from of the Tent of Meeting 7 times.
- The cow is (completely) burnt in its prescence:
  - it hide, lfesh, blood & dung
  - cast cedar wood, hyssop & crimson wool into the fire
- After the Kohen washes his clothes & bathes (his flesh in water),
  - he may enter the camp
  - he is unclean till evening

**N**: _Mishneh Torah_ speaks of 9 red heifers that were prepared for the people &mdash; until the destruction of the Second Temple. Then why differentiate between those that no yoke laid upon them, and those that had &mdash; intimating that there were more than 9 heifers in existence.

19:11]
11Anyone touching the corpse of a human soul shall become unclean for seven days.     יאהַנֹּגֵ֥עַ בְּמֵ֖ת לְכָל־נֶ֣פֶשׁ אָדָ֑ם וְטָמֵ֖א שִׁבְעַ֥ת יָמִֽים:

**N**: In the midst of the description of the red heifer, and that anyone who touches it's remains becomes unclean, it is suddenly here connected to becoming unclean upon contact with a human corpse.{.note}

This verse, and the ones following trace a tangled path. Starting with v7, the Kohen is unclean till evening and needs to wash, as do the ones who burnt the red heifer and stored the ashes - outside the camp in a "clean" place (v10). The stored ashes are to be used to sprinkle water as a cleansing. [**N**: Perhaps the Catholic ritual of sprinkling of holy
water was derived from this ritual.]{.note}

Now, we jump to the general population, and speak of the contamination from touching a corpse that lasts for seven days.  In order to cleanse, one needs to sprinkle oneself with the holy water on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 7<sup>th</sup> days, else the cleansing will not work (v12). Not only that, but "he has defiled the Mishkan of the Lord, and that soul shall be cut off from Israel." Finally, if the person dies in a tent, the tent remains unclean for 7 days (v14). Now an open vessel can become unclean (v15), and anyone touch a human bone or a grave becomes unclean for 7 days (v16). The remedy is dip _hyssop_ the water of purification (from the red heifer's ashes) and for a "ritually clean person" to sprinkle it on all the _Tamei_ people and artifacts.

- Living water (19:17)

Water from an ever-flowing spring. Fallacious springs which run dry even once in seven years are disqualified.
(Sifri; Talmud, Parah 8:9)

This is lesson in the meaning of truth: something which exists under certain circumstances but ceases under other is not "true", even when it does exist
(The Chassidic Masters)

- And the entire congregation arrived in the wilderness of Zin in the first month (20:1)

All the events and prophecies which the Torah relates [pertaining to the time that the people of Israel were in the desert], are either of the first or of the fortieth year
(Ibn Ezra)

- And Miriam died there... And there was no water for the congregation (20:1-2)

Three great providers arose for the people of Israel—Moses, Aaron and Miriam—through whom they received three great gifts: the well, the clouds [of glory], and the manna. The well was in the merit of Miriam, the clouds in the merit of Aaron, and the manna in the merit of Moses.

When Miriam died, the well was removed, as it says, "And Miriam died there..." and, immediately afterward, "And there was no water for the congregation." The well then resumed in the merit of the other two.

When Aaron died, the clouds of glory were removed, as it says, "And the Canaanite, the King of Arad, heard ...and waged war on Israel." He heard that Aaron died, and thought that he now had license to attack Israel [because the clouds of glory which protected them were gone. The well and the clouds] then resumed in the merit of Moses alone.

**N**: So, the clouds of glory protected the people as well as guide them.{.note}

(Talmud, Taanit 9a)

- And Miriam died there... And there was no water for the congregation (20:1-2)

A person may ingest the ingredients of life, but these will not vitalize him without the fluids that course through his body. The food swallowed by the stomach, the oxygen drawn in by the lungs, must now be transported through the bodys canals and made to saturate its every cell.

Therein lies the spiritual significance of Miriam's role as Israel's provider of "water". Miriam first appears in the Torah (see Midrashim and commentaries on Exodus 1:15) as a children's nurse: one who distills adult food for the consumption of a child; one who trains and educates a growing human being, filtering the stimuli of an adult world for his maturing mind: who processes the raw materials of life to meet the specific needs of her charges age and phase of development.

Miriam's well is the vital fluid of Israel's spiritual life, the water that inculcates them with the knowledge and identity her brothers provide. The waters of Miriam transport and apply the nutrients of Torah and the abstractions of faith to each individual, on his or her particular level.

(The Lubavitcher Rebbe)

- Because you did not believe in Me (20:12)

If a leader's influence on the community is achieved through harsh words of rebuke, than his relationship with the environment is likewise: he will have to forcefully impose his will on it to get it to serve his people's needs and their mission in life. If, however, he influences his community by lovingly uplifting them to a higher place so that they, on their own, will desire to improve themselves, the world will likewise willingly yield its resources to the furtherance of his goals.

(Chassidic Master Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Barditchev)

---

- These are the Waters of Strife (20:13)

Why did Pharaoh decree that all the Hebrew babes be cast into the river? (Exodus 1:22) Because his astrologers foresaw that the savior of Israel will meet his demise by water. They thought that he would be drowned in water; in truth, it was that by the cause of a well of water death was decreed on him.

(Midrash Rabbah)

- Hor HaHar (20:22)

It was a mountain on top of a mountain, like a small apple perched on top of a big one.

(Midrash Rabbah)

---

- Take Aaron and Elazar his son, and take up Hor HaHar (20:25)

G‑d said to Moses: "Do Me a favor and tell Aaron that he is to die, for I am ashamed to tell him."

What did Moses do? He rose early in the morning and went to Aaron, and called to him: "Aaron, my brother!" Aaron came out to him and asked: "Why did you see fit to come so early today?" Said Moses to him: "There was something in the Torah which occupied my mind during the night and which I had difficulty with, so I rose early and came to you." Asked Aaron: "What was this thing?" Said Moses to him: "I do not remember what it was, but I know that it was in the book of Genesis; bring it and let us read from it."

So they took a scroll of the Book of Genesis and read from it. With each chapter and each thing they read, Moses would say: "G‑d did well; G‑d created well." When they came to the creation of man, Moses said: "What can be said of man, who brought death into the world!" Said Aaron: "Moses, my brother, can you say that in this matter we do not accept the Divine decree?" ... Said Moses: "And I, who ruled over the ministering angels, and you, who stopped death [with the ketoret], shall we, too, come to this?"... Immediately Aaron felt his demise in his bones... Said Aaron to him: " 'My heart is trembles within me, and the terrors of death are befallen me' (Psalms 55:5)."

Said Moses to him: "Are you prepared to die?" Said he: "Yes." Said Moses: "Let us then ascend Hor HaHar." Thereupon the three of them—Moses, Aaron and Elazar—ascended before the eyes of all of Israel...

When they ascended [the mountain], a cave opened up for them...

Said Moses to Aaron: "Enter the cave." He entered, and he saw there a made-up bed and a burning candle. Said Moses to him: "Go up onto the bed." He went up. "Straighten your arms." He straightened them. "Close your mouth." He closed it...

Thereupon the Shechinah (Divine Presence) came down and kissed him.

(At that moment, Moses desired a death such as that. Thus it was later said to him (Deuteronomy 32:50): "And you will die on the mountain... as Aaron your brother died on Hor HaHar"--the death which you coveted.)

G‑d said to them: "Go out from here." As soon as they went out, the cave was sealed, and Moses and Elazar descended.

(Yalkut Shimoni; Rashi)

And all the congregation saw that Aaron had died (20:29)

When Moses and Elazar descended from the mountain, the people assembled against them and demanded of them: "Where is Aaron?" They answered them: "He is dead." "How could the Angel of Death strike him?" they cried. "He was a man who had withstood the Angel of Death and had restrained him! (As it is written, 'And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stayed'-- Numbers 18:13.) If you bring him back, well and good; if not, we shall stone you!" Thereupon Moses resorted to prayer, and said: "Master of the Universe! Deliver us from suspicion." Straightway the Holy One, blessed be He, opened the cave and showed Aaron to them. Thus the verse states: "And all the congregation saw that Aaron had died...."

(Midrash Rabbah)

- And the valleys of Arnon and the outpouring of the streams... and from there to the well (21:14-16)

This song was sung at the end of the forty years, and the well was given to them at the beginning of the forty years. What is the reason then why it was written here?

This subject must be expounded by reference to what precedes it, viz., "Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of G‑d: Vaheb is Sufa, and the valleys of Arnon." This implies that G‑d wrought for them signs and miracles in the valleys of Arnon like the miracles that He had wrought for them at the sea of Suf (the Red Sea).

What was the nature of the miracles in the valleys of Arnon? A man could stand on the top of one mountain and speak with his neighbor on the top of the other mountain, yet he would be seven miles away from him! For the road ran down into the valley and ascended. Israel, on their way, had to pass through the midst of the valley. All the nations assembled at that spot, armies without end, and some of them took up positions within the valley. The cliffs above them were riddled with caves. Opposite these caves, in the mountain facing this one, there were numerous rocky projections resembling breasts... The armies entered into the caves, thinking: When Israel come down into the valley, those who are in the valley will confront them, and those who are above will harass them from the caves, and so we shall slay them all.

When, however, Israel reached that spot G‑d did not make it necessary for them to descend to the bottom of the valley, but signaled to the mountains, and the projections of the opposite mountain entered into the caves, and all the occupants were killed. Furthermore, the mountains brought their heads close to each other and formed a level road, and it was impossible to tell one mountain from the next.

That valley was the boundary between the Land of Israel and the land of Moab; as it says, "For Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Emorites." The mountain in the land of Moab in which the caves were did not move, while the mountain from the Land of Israel in which were the rocky projections resembling breasts moved and joined the mountain opposite. Why was it the one to move? Because it belonged to the Land of Israel. It may be compared to the case of a handmaid who, on seeing her master's son coming to her, advanced quickly to meet him and welcomed him.

The rocky projections entered into the caves and crushed all the warriors in them. The Well descended into the valley and there it swelled and destroyed all the armies in the same manner as the Red Sea had destroyed the armies [of the Egyptians]. For this reason "Vaheb in Sufa" and "the valleys of Arnon" are placed side by side for comparison.

Israel passed along the top of those mountains and did not know of all the miracles. Said the Holy One, blessed be He: "I will let My children know how many armies I have destroyed on their account." The well descended into the caves and washed out skulls, arms, and legs innumerable. Israel returned in search of the well and saw it coming from the valley full, carrying limbs upon limbs. Israel saw and sang.

(Midrash Rabbah; Rashi)

- And Moab said to the elders of Midian (22:4)

Moab and Midian were erstwhile enemies, as it is written (Genesis 36:35) "...who smote Midian in the field of Moab"; but out of fear of Israel, they made peace between them.

And why did Moab seek the advice of Midian? When they saw that Israel was victorious beyond the norm, they thought: "The leader of this people rose to greatness in Midian; we shall ask them what is his measure." Said they: "His power is entirely in his mouth." Said Moab: "We, too, shall bring a person whose power is in his mouth against them."

(Rashi)

---

- Curse me this people, for he is mightier than me (22:6)

The Hebrew phrase, Atzum hu mimeni ("He is mightier than me") also translates, "He is mightier from me." For in truth, the might of the people of Israel is Moshiach, who is descendent of Balak! (Ruth the Moabite, anscestress of King David, is a descendent of Balak).

(Shaloh)

- And G‑d came to Balaam at night (22:20)

The Divine spirit visited him only at night, as is the case with all the prophets of the nations (Laban, too, received his prophecy in a nocturnal dream, as it says (Genesis 31:24), "And G‑d said to Laban the Aramite in a dream at night") — like a man covertly visiting his concubine.

(Rashi)

---

- And Balaam arose in the morning, and saddled his ass (22:21)

In order to place before man the "free choice" that is essential to his mission in life, G‑d so ordered His world that every positive force has its negative counterpart. Were there to exist a good element which cannot be put to corrupt use, then man's potential for evil would be disadvantaged and would not present the equal challenge which makes for the choice factor in life. In the words of King Solomon (Ecclesiastes 7:14), "One corresponding to the other, G‑d created."

But this "equality" between good and evil extends only to the most superficial level of reality. When a person learns to look beyond the surface of things to their inherent purpose, he will see that only the good in the world is real and substantial. Good is an existence in its own right, while evil exists merely to provide the tension which imbues the positive acts of man with meaning and significance.

Hence, there cannot be anything "original" to evil, which is but a shallow, corrupted refraction of the good in the world.

(The Lubavitcher Rebbe)

---

- An angel of G‑d stood in the way... his sword drawn in his hand (22:22-23)

Could not the angel have breathed on him and taken his life away, that he must draw his sword? ... He could; but he said to Balaam ... you exchange your trade and come against Israel with a weapon that is theirs! I, then, will come against you with a weapon that is yours."

(Midrash Rabbah)

---

-- And the ass saw the angel of G‑d (22:23)

But Balaam did not see it, for G‑d has enabled the animal to see more than man. Because man has greater understanding, he would go insane if he were able to see the forces of destruction.

(Rashi)

---

- And G‑d opened the mouth of the ass (22:28)

This was to impress upon Balaam that there is no place for pride over the fact that he has been given the gift of prophecy. If it suites G‑d's purposes, even an ass will see angels and make speeches.

(Keli Yakar)

---

- And [Balak] went out to meet him... on [Moab's] utmost border (22:36)

Why did he greet him at the border? He said to him: "These boundaries, which have been established since the days of Noah with the understanding that one nation does not violate the boundaries of the other—these people are coming to uproot! Come and curse them!" And he showed how they broke through and crossed the boundaries of Sichon and Og.

(Midrash Tanchuma)

**N**: An interesting observation. Israel was an upstart nation, breaking the convention by which the surrounding nations had maintained.{.note}

---

- And G‑d happened upon Balaam (23:4)

The hallmark of evil and unholiness is an attitude of "It just happened." Nothing is coincidental to the Jew; every event is purposeful and significant.

(Chassidic Saying)

- He sees not iniquity in Jacob, and He perceives not _amal_ ("trouble" or "toil") in Israel (23:21)

This implies that "Jacob" does experience "trouble" and "toil" (amal), though these do not result in his guilt in the eyes of G‑d. "Israel" on the other hand, enjoys an existence devoid not only of guilt but also of struggle.

"Jacob" and "Israel" are the two names by which the third Patriarch was called and, by extension, two names for the Jewish people. Each represents a different period in the life of the Patriarch and a different dimension of the life of the people.

Jacob was born grasping the heel of his elder twin, Esau; thus he was named "Jacob" (Yaakov, in the Hebrew), which means "at the heel" (Genesis 25:26). Years later, when Jacob disguised himself as Esau to receive the blessings that Isaac intended to give the elder brother, Esau proclaimed: "No wonder he is called Jacob ('cunning')! Twice he has deceived me (ibid., 27:36).

"Jacob" is the Jew still in the thick of the battle of life — a battle in which he is often "at the heel," dealing with the lowlier aspects of his own personality and of his environment. It is also a battle which he must wage with furtiveness and stealth (the second meaning of "Jacob"), for he is in enemy territory and must disguise his true intentions in order to outmaneuver those who attempt to ensnare him.

Threatened by a hostile world, plagued by his own shortcomings and negative inclinations, "Jacob" is defined by the axiomatic condition of man — that "man is born to toil" (Job 5:7) and that human life is an obstacle course of challenges to ones integrity.

In contrast, Israel ("divine master") is the name given to Jacob when he "struggled with the Divine and with men, and prevailed" (Genesis 32:29). "Israel" describes the Jew who has prevailed over his own humanity, cultivating the intrinsic perfection of his soul to the extent that he is immune to all challenges and temptations; who has prevailed over the divine decree that "man is born to toil," achieving a tranquil existence amidst the turbulence of life.

The Jewish people include both "Jacobs" and "Israels", and the life of every individual Jew has its "Jacob" periods and its "Israel" moments. For "there are two types of pleasure before G‑d. The first is from the complete abnegation of evil and its transformation from bitterness to sweetness and from darkness to light by the tzaddikim. The second [pleasure] is when evil is repelled while it is still at its strongest and mightiest... through the initiative of the 'intermediate man" (beinoni)... as in the analogy of physical food, in which there are two types of delicacies that give pleasure: the first being the pleasure derived from sweet and pleasant foods; and the second, from sharp and sour foods, which are spiced and prepared in such a way that they become delicacies that revive the soul" (Tanya ch. 27).

(From the teachings of Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi)

- I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have blessed them altogether (24:10)
-

The Talmud forbids to name one's child after a wicked person, quoting the verse (Proverbs 10:7), "The name of the wicked shall rot." Yet an entire section of Torah is named after Balak, King of Moab, to whom the Midrash accords the title "who hated [the Jewish people] most of all their enemies."

For Balak is the Parshah of the future, where evil is transformed to good and curses emerge as blessings. It is in Balak that the most beautiful verses describing the uniqueness of Israel and the speciality of their relationship with the Almighty issue from the vile mouth of Balaam, summoned by Balak to curse the Jewish people. And it is in Balak that the most explicit reference to the era of Moshiach in the Five Books of Moses is found, in the form of a prophecy by the selfsame Balaam.

In the Parshah of Balak we enter a Moshiach-like world---a world of "the greater wisdom that comes from folly, and the greater light that comes from darkness" (Ecclesiastes 2:13).

(The Lubavitcher Rebbe)

- And the people began to go astray after the daughters of Moab (25:1)
-

Said she to him: "Would you like to drink a glass of wine?" Having drunk, his passion was inflamed and he exclaimed to her, "Yield to me!" Thereupon she brought forth an idol from her bosom and said to him, "Worship this."

(Talmud, Sanhedrin 106a)

Behold, a man of the children of Israel came, and brought... a Midianite woman before the eyes of Moses, and before the eyes of all the congregation of the children of Israel; and they stood weeping (25:6)

The woman said to him: "I shall give myself to none but Moses, for so my father Balak bade me, not to yield to any one but to Moses your master, because my father is a king." Said he to her: "Behold, I am as great as he is! I shall bring you out before their eyes!" He seized her by her plait and brought her to Moses. He said to him: "O son of Amram! Is this woman permitted or forbidden?" He answered him: "She is forbidden to you." Said Zimri to him: "The woman whom you married was a Midianitess!" Thereupon Moses felt powerless and the law slipped from his mind.

All Israel wailed aloud, as for it says, "And they stood weeping." Why were they weeping? Because they became powerless at that moment.

(Midrash Rabbah)
