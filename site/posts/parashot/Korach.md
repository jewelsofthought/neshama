**N**: The thought that arises from the _parasha_ today is when is there going to be a sotry that is uplifting? That is of us, or someone, succeeding...

Even the highest point, the Revelation at Sinai, is marred by the story of the Golden Calf.

Response: That perhaps comes in the later books. Torah, a manual handed down by G-d &mdash; in code of course &mdash; that will guide us in our realationship with the Creator and His Creation. [In fact, whithout the Creation we could never know the Creator!]

Why is there the counting and other mundane elements? Because to understand requires a dedicated focus, a willingness to  enter to enter the depths where the Wisdom is hidden.
