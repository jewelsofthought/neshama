## Chapter 6

v1-4] I am **HaShem**

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ב וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־משֶׁ֑ה וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖יו אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָֽה:
<br />
ג וָֽאֵרָ֗א אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֶל־יִצְחָ֥ק וְאֶל־יַֽעֲקֹ֖ב בְּאֵ֣ל שַׁדָּ֑י וּשְׁמִ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖עְתִּי לָהֶֽם:
<br />
ד וְגַ֨ם הֲקִמֹ֤תִי אֶת־בְּרִיתִי֙ אִתָּ֔ם לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶ֖ם אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן אֵ֛ת אֶ֥רֶץ מְגֻֽרֵיהֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־גָּ֥רוּ בָֽהּ:
</p>
<p>
2. God spoke to Moses, and He said to him, "I am the Lord."
<br />
3. "I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob with [the name] Almighty God, but [with] My name <b>YHWH</b>, I did not become known to them."
<br />
4. And also, I established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojourning in which they sojourned.  
</p>
</blockquote>

This reading opens up with G-d speaking to Moses, saying: "I am the Lord, [יהוה]{dir="rtl"} ." He mentions that He used the name _El Shaddai_, Almighty G-d, for Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, with whom He had established His covenant &mdash; though He did not fulfil it in their lifetimes.

v5] "I heard their moans"

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ה וְגַ֣ם | אֲנִ֣י שָׁמַ֗עְתִּי אֶת־נַֽאֲקַת֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר מִצְרַ֖יִם מַֽעֲבִדִ֣ים אֹתָ֑ם וָֽאֶזְכֹּ֖ר אֶת־בְּרִיתִֽי:
</p>
<p>
5. And also, I heard the moans of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians are holding in bondage, and I remembered My covenant.
</p>
</blockquote>

v6] "I will save you"

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ו לָכֵ֞ן אֱמֹ֥ר לִבְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֘ אֲנִ֣י יְהֹוָה֒ וְהֽוֹצֵאתִ֣י אֶתְכֶ֗ם מִתַּ֨חַת֙ סִבְלֹ֣ת מִצְרַ֔יִם וְהִצַּלְתִּ֥י אֶתְכֶ֖ם מֵֽעֲבֹֽדָתָ֑ם וְגָֽאַלְתִּ֤י אֶתְכֶם֙ בִּזְר֣וֹעַ נְטוּיָ֔ה וּבִשְׁפָטִ֖ים גְּדֹלִֽים:
</p>
<p>
6. Therefore, say to the children of Israel, 'I am the Lord, and I will take you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will save you from their labour, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.'
</p>
</blockquote>

He acknowledges His sympathy with the plight of the children of Israel, and He remembered His covenant. Thus He requires of Moses to announce to his people that "I am the Lord, and I will":

1. Take you out from the burdens of the Egyptians
2. Rescue you ([הִצלתי]{dir="rtl"} ) from their labour
3. Redeem you ([געלתי]{dir="rtl"} )
   - with outstretched arm &
   - great judgements ([שׁפטים]{dir="rtl"} )

v7-8] "I will..."

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ז וְלָֽקַחְתִּ֨י אֶתְכֶ֥ם לִי֙ לְעָ֔ם וְהָיִ֥יתִי לָכֶ֖ם לֵֽאלֹהִ֑ים וִֽידַעְתֶּ֗ם כִּ֣י אֲנִ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹ֣הֵיכֶ֔ם הַמּוֹצִ֣יא אֶתְכֶ֔ם מִתַּ֖חַת סִבְל֥וֹת מִצְרָֽיִם:  
<br />
ח וְהֵֽבֵאתִ֤י אֶתְכֶם֙ אֶל־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֤ר נָשָׂ֨אתִי֙ אֶת־יָדִ֔י לָתֵ֣ת אֹתָ֔הּ לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם לְיִצְחָ֖ק וּלְיַֽעֲקֹ֑ב וְנָֽתַתִּ֨י אֹתָ֥הּ לָכֶ֛ם מֽוֹרָשָׁ֖ה אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָֽה:
</p>
<p>
7. And I will take you to Me as a people, and I will be a God to you, and you will know that I am the Lord your God, Who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. <br />
8. "I will bring you to the land, concerning which I raised My hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you as a heritage; I am the Lord."
</p>
</blockquote>

I will:

- Take you as my people
- Know that I am your **HaShem**, your G-d
- Bring you to promised land

**Note**: The last promise (v8), one which was promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but was never fulfilled. So this promise is to be fulfilled over a period of 200 - 400 years, which is a very long time. Yet, although it has taken so long, it is still looked at as a true promise, as it eventually did manifest.{.note}

v9] Israel ignored Moses

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ט וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר משֶׁ֛ה כֵּ֖ן אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְלֹ֤א שָֽׁמְעוּ֙ אֶל־משֶׁ֔ה מִקֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ וּמֵֽעֲבֹדָ֖ה קָשָֽׁה:
</p>
<p>
9. Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel, but they did not hearken to Moses because of [their] shortness of breath and because of [their] hard labour.
</p>
</blockquote>

v10-12] Will Pharaoh listen?

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
י וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־משֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹֽר:  
יא בֹּ֣א דַבֵּ֔ר אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה מֶ֣לֶךְ מִצְרָ֑יִם וִֽישַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵֽאַרְצֽוֹ:  
יב וַיְדַבֵּ֣ר משֶׁ֔ה לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה לֵאמֹ֑ר הֵ֤ן בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֹא־שָֽׁמְע֣וּ אֵלַ֔י וְאֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה וַֽאֲנִ֖י עֲרַ֥ל שְׂפָתָֽיִם:
</p>
<p>
10. The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, <br />
11. Come, speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and he will let the children of Israel out of his land.
12. But Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of Israel did not hearken to me. How then will Pharaoh hearken to me, seeing that I am of closed lips?
</p>
</blockquote>

G-d then suggests to Moses to talk to the Pharoah. But Moses objects, saying, "The children of Israel did not listen to me. How then will Pharaoh be expected to?"

**Note**: The lesson I learn from this is that G-d does not want our abject obedience. He wants us to engage (with Her &ndash; the Divine Presence). If you are only capbale of blind obedience, then that is fine. But if you are able to penetrate deeper into the mysteries, and you choose to ignore the blessing that has been bestowed,  upon that you may well be judged.{.note}

v13] Lord spoke to Moses

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
יג וַיְדַבֵּ֣ר יְהֹוָה֘ אֶל־משֶׁ֣ה וְאֶל־אַֽהֲרֹן֒ וַיְצַוֵּם֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְאֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה מֶ֣לֶךְ מִצְרָ֑יִם לְהוֹצִ֥יא אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם:
</p>
<p>
13. So the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and He commanded them concerning the children of Israel and concerning Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to let the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. </p>
</blockquote>

But the Lord ignores Moses, and He commands them regarding Israel and the Pharaoh. Though details of what He said to them are lacking, the only piece that we know is that He spoke to them about letting the children of Israel free.

v14-25] List of heads of houses (see [Names](../Va_eira/index.html#names))

v26-29] Moses & Aaron

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
כו ה֥וּא אַֽהֲרֹ֖ן וּמשֶׁ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָמַ֤ר יְהֹוָה֙ לָהֶ֔ם הוֹצִ֜יאוּ אֶת־בְּנֵ֧י יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם עַל־צִבְאֹתָֽם:
<br />
כז הֵ֗ם הַֽמְדַבְּרִים֙ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֣ה מֶֽלֶךְ־מִצְרַ֔יִם לְהוֹצִ֥יא אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מִמִּצְרָ֑יִם ה֥וּא משֶׁ֖ה וְאַֽהֲרֹֽן:
</p>
<p>
26. That is Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, "Take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their legions." <br />
27. They are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to let the children of Israel out of Egypt; they are Moses and Aaron.
</p>
</blockquote>

This just repeats what was said in v13.

v29-30] Moses objects: "I am of closed lips".

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
כט וַיְדַבֵּ֧ר יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶל־משֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹ֖ר אֲנִ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה דַּבֵּ֗ר אֶל־פַּרְעֹה֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ מִצְרַ֔יִם אֵ֛ת כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲנִ֖י דֹּבֵ֥ר אֵלֶֽיךָ:
<br />
ל וַיֹּ֥אמֶר משֶׁ֖ה לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה הֵ֤ן אֲנִי֙ עֲרַ֣ל שְׂפָתַ֔יִם וְאֵ֕יךְ יִשְׁמַ֥ע אֵלַ֖י פַּרְעֹֽה:
</p>
<p>
29. that the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh everything that I speak to you."<br />
30. But Moses said before the Lord, "Behold, I am of closed lips; so how will Pharaoh hearken to me?"
</p>
</blockquote>

G-d instructs Moses to speak of everything that He has said. Moses objects again, referring to himself as one of "closed lips".

## Chapter 7

v1-5] Know that I am the Lord

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ב אַתָּ֣ה תְדַבֵּ֔ר אֵ֖ת כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֲצַוֶּ֑ךָּ וְאַֽהֲרֹ֤ן אָחִ֨יךָ֙ יְדַבֵּ֣ר אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֔ה וְשִׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵֽאַרְצֽוֹ:
<br />
ג וַֽאֲנִ֥י אַקְשֶׁ֖ה אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה וְהִרְבֵּיתִ֧י אֶת־אֹֽתֹתַ֛י וְאֶת־מֽוֹפְתַ֖י בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם:
<br />
ד וְלֹא־יִשְׁמַ֤ע אֲלֵכֶם֙ פַּרְעֹ֔ה וְנָֽתַתִּ֥י אֶת־יָדִ֖י בְּמִצְרָ֑יִם וְהֽוֹצֵאתִ֨י אֶת־צִבְאֹתַ֜י אֶת־עַמִּ֤י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם בִּשְׁפָטִ֖ים גְּדֹלִֽים:
<br />
ה וְיָֽדְע֤וּ מִצְרַ֨יִם֙ כִּֽי־אֲנִ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה בִּנְטֹתִ֥י אֶת־יָדִ֖י עַל־מִצְרָ֑יִם וְהֽוֹצֵאתִ֥י אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מִתּוֹכָֽם:
</p>
<p>
2. You shall speak all that I command you, and Aaron, your brother, shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel out of his land.<br />
3. But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and I will increase My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.<br />
4. But Pharaoh will not hearken to you, and I will lay My hand upon the Egyptians, and I will take My legions, My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt with great judgments.<br />
5. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I stretch forth My hand over Egypt, and I will take the children of Israel out of their midst.
</p>
</blockquote>

G-d repeats that they must say all that he has said to Pharaoh, so that he will let the Israelites out of his land. However, He then says the "He will harden Pharaoh's heart". That enables the Lord to show His great judgements to Egypt, so that they will know that "I am Lord".

**Note**: This is interesting, that He needs to show them the He is Lord, and in order to do that, Pharaoh cannot agree to let our people go until the Lord has proved His point.{.note}

Moses was 80 and Aaron 83 (v7).

v8-13] The Lord provides a sign for them, Aaron's staff will become a serpent. So, when they come to the Pharaoh, and Aaron throws his staff in front of Pharaoh, it turns into a serpent.

However, Pharaoh's necromancers do the same thing. And even though Aaron's staff swallowed all the other serpents, Pharaoh's heart remained steadfast, and he refuses to let our people go.

### Blood [דָֽם]{dir="rtl"}

Then G-d commands Moses to meet the Pharaoh at the river Nile, and you shall say to him: "Send forth My people, so that they may serve Me in the desert." As you have not listened to my request, I will turn the waters of the Nile to blood with my staff, and with this "you will know that I am Lord, G-d of the Hebrews". The fish will die, and the waters will become putrid. (v15-18)

v19] "Stretch your staff over the waters"

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
יט וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־משֶׁ֗ה אֱמֹ֣ר אֶל־אַֽהֲרֹ֡ן קַ֣ח מַטְּךָ֣ וּנְטֵה־יָֽדְךָ֩ עַל־מֵימֵ֨י מִצְרַ֜יִם עַל־נַֽהֲרֹתָ֣ם | עַל־יְאֹֽרֵיהֶ֣ם וְעַל־אַגְמֵיהֶ֗ם וְעַ֛ל כָּל־מִקְוֵ֥ה מֵֽימֵיהֶ֖ם וְיִֽהְיוּ־דָ֑ם וְהָ֤יָה דָם֙ בְּכָל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם וּבָֽעֵצִ֖ים וּבָֽאֲבָנִֽים:
</p>
<p>
19. The Lord said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch forth your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their canals, over their ponds, and over all their bodies of water, and they will become blood, and there will be blood throughout the entire land of Egypt, even in wood and in stone.'"
</p>
</blockquote>

v20-25] Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded. He struck the Nile with his staff, and all the waters turned to blood. However, the necromancers of Egypt did the same with their secret rites, and thus the Pharaoh did not heed them.

This lasted seven full days and all the Egyptians had to dig around the Nile to dig for water to drink.

**Note**: If the Egyptian necromancers had secret rites with which they could turn water to blood, surely Moses would have known that? And if not Moses, then surely G-d would have known?{.note}

It seems more and more, that G-d was setting up the final climax of the death of the first-born to show the world what He was capable of.{.note}

### Frogs [צְפַרְדְּעִ֔ים]{dir="rtl"}

Then the Lord says to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, and say to him "Let My people go, so that they may serve Me. If you refuse, I will smite your borders with frogs. They will go up and come into your house and into your bedroom and upon your bed and into the house of your servants and into your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading troughs; and into you and into your people and into all your servants" (v26-29).

**Note**: "Into you and your people and your servants". How (and why) did these frogs enter into the people?{.note}

## Chapter 8

v1-11]

The Lord then tells Moses to tell Aaron to "stretch your hand with your staff over the rivers, the canals and the ponds to bring forth the frogs". (v1)

**Note**: How could he stretch his hand with his staff over the land?}

Aaron did as commanded. (v2)

**Note**: Moses requests Aaron to speak in his name, as he had "closed lips". However, these three plagues, are implemented by Aaron. This is not speaking but action &mdash; and this is not the help that Moses asked for!{.note}

However the necromancers of Egypt did likewise "with their secret rites". (v3)

Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and asked them to remove the frogs, and "he will let the people go and sacrifice to the Lord" (v4).

Moses says he will do it to show the Pharoah that there is "none like the Lord, our God", [כִּי־אֵ֖ין כַּֽיהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ]{dir="rtl"}.

So Moses "cried out to the Lord", and the Lord did according to Moses' words, and the frogs died out, and the land stank. But the Pharoah reneged on his promise. (v9-11)

### Lice [כִּנָּ֔ם]{dir="rtl"}

Then the Lord says to Moses: "Say to Aaron: 'Stretch forth your staff and strike the dust of the earth, and it shall become lice throughout the entire land of Egypt.'" (v12)

Then the text says the Aaron stretched forth his hand [**Note**: Whereas the command as written was to stretch forth his staff!]{.note} and struck the dust of the earth... and the dust became lice (v13).

The Egyptians necromancers tried to use their secret rites to bring out the lice, but the could not. So they said to Pharaoh, "It is the finger of G-d, _Elohim_ (v14). [**Note**: How did they know of the existence of this _Elohim_? And why would they say that He is the One doing this? Would they not say it was one of their G-d's, or at least a G-d more familiar than them. This speaks to my hypothesis that the cult of **YHWH** was more widespread than just amongst the Hebrews.]{.note}

**Note**: There is also the possiblity that G-d had to show the Pharaoh and all of Egypt, that He could do things that the Egyptian necromancers could not do.{.note}

But Pharaoh did not hearken to them (v15).

### Noxious creatures [עָרֹ֔ב]{dir="rtl"}

G-d then instructs Moses to meet Pharaoh at the waters in the early morning, and say the Lord says: ""Let My people go out and serve Me". Else I will incite noxious creatures against you and all the houses of Egypt. In addition, [**Note**: to show my power]{.note} there will be no noxious creatures in the land of Goshen (v16-18).

This time "the Lord did so". Not Moses nor Aaron instigated this plague, which destroyed the land (v20).

Pharaoh relents and tells Moses to "Go, sacrifice to your God in the land." But Moses objects, arguing that if they will need to "sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to God our Lord", and, as the sheep is a deity of the Egyptians, if they sacrifice this deity "before the eyes of the people", they will stone us. Let us rather go for a three-day journey into the desert, where we will sacrifice to our Lord, our G-d (v21-23). [**Note**: He requested a three-day journey to the place where they would sacrifice to the our Lord. However three days there, three days back and a minimum of three days for the ceremony &ndash; will make for at least nine days absence.]{.note}

Pharaoh agrees to let them go. So Moses entreats the Lord, who does according to Moses' word, and removes the noxious creatures (v24-27).

But Pharaoh hardened his heart, and did not let the people go (v28).

## Chapter 9

### Livestock [מִקְנְה]{dir="rtl}

The Lord says to Moses, go again to Pharaoh, and say to him, if you do not "send out My people so that they may serve Me", I will lay my hand upon your livestock and all your domestic animals, the horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep and cause them to have a "very severe pestilence." However, none of the livestock of Israel will be affected (v1-4).

God did this thing on the morrow. Whereupon Pharaoh still did not relent (v6-7)

## Boils [שְׁחִ֥ין]{dir="rtl"}

v8-9] "Take furnace soot..."

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
חוַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָה֘ אֶל־משֶׁ֣ה וְאֶל־אַֽהֲרֹן֒ קְח֤וּ לָכֶם֙ מְלֹ֣א חָפְנֵיכֶ֔ם פִּ֖יחַ כִּבְשָׁ֑ן וּזְרָק֥וֹ משֶׁ֛ה הַשָּׁמַ֖יְמָה לְעֵינֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה:
<br />
טוְהָיָ֣ה לְאָבָ֔ק עַ֖ל כָּל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם וְהָיָ֨ה עַל־הָֽאָדָ֜ם וְעַל־הַבְּהֵמָ֗ה לִשְׁחִ֥ין פֹּרֵ֛חַ אֲבַעְבֻּעֹ֖ת בְּכָל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם:
</p>
<p>
8. The Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take yourselves handfuls of furnace soot, and Moses shall cast it heavenward before Pharaoh's eyes.<br />
9. And it will become dust upon the entire land of Egypt, and it will become boils, breaking out into blisters upon man and upon beast throughout the entire land of Egypt."
</p>
</blockquote>

The Lord speaks to Moses and Aaron, saying: "Take some furnace soot and cast it heavenward." (v10)

So they did as He commanded, and the whole of Egypt broke out in boils, that became blisters upon man and beast (v11).

This time even the necromancers " could not stand before Moses because of the boils". But the Lord strengthened Pharaoh's heart and he did not hearken to them. (v12)

v13] "Speak to Pharaoh"

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
יג וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־משֶׁ֔ה הַשְׁכֵּ֣ם בַּבֹּ֔קֶר וְהִתְיַצֵּ֖ב לִפְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה וְאָֽמַרְתָּ֣ אֵלָ֗יו כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽעִבְרִ֔ים שַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־עַמִּ֖י וְיַֽעַבְדֻֽנִי:
</p>
<p>
13. The Lord said to Moses, "Rise early in the morning and stand erect before Pharaoh, and say to him, 'So said the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, "Let My people go so that they may worship Me.
</p>
</blockquote>

### Hail [בָּרָ֖ד כָּבֵ֣ד]{dir="rtl"}

The Lord tells Moses to go meet Pharaoh. And say to him, unless you let My people go, I will send "all My plagues into your heart and into your servants and into your people, in order that you know that there is none like Me in the entire earth (v14).

v15-21] I have smitten all your people, with a pestilence that could have annihilated you and your people. However, I have allowed you to stand, 'in order to show you My strength and in order to declare My name all over the earth.'

If you do not relent, I will rain down upon you a very heavy hail. Any person or beast "any man or beast that is found in the field and not brought into the house the hail shall fall on them, and they will die."

In this way, the people were separated into those "who feared the word of the Lord of Pharaoh's servants drove his servants and his livestock into the houses. But he who did not pay attention to the word of the Lord left his servants and his livestock in the field.

**Note**: Who were these Egyptians who believed in the word of the Lord?{.note}

So the Lord commanded Moses, "Stretch forth your hand heavenward, and hail will be upon the entire land of Egypt." And Moses did as the Lord commanded. And the hail struck " throughout the entire land of Egypt". Only in Goshen was there no hail. (v22-26)

Pharaoh summons Moses and Aaron, and promises to let our people go.
Moses responds that he will remove the hail " in order that you know that the land is the Lord's." (v27)

Upon Moses "spreading out his hands to the Lord, the thunder and the hail ceased." But Pharaoh continued to sin, but he did not relent. (v33-35)

## Haftorah - _Yechezkel_ 28:25

This week's haftorah teaches us a profound lesson in arrogance and self dependency. Hashem instructed the prophet Yechezkel to deliver a crushing blow to Pharaoh and his Egyptian empire and predict its total destruction.

Hashem said, "Behold I am sending the sword after you that will decimate man and animal. Egypt will lay desolate and ruined... in response to your saying, 'The river is mine and I developed it.'" (29: 8,9) Hashem held Pharaoh and Egypt fully accountable for their arrogant approach to prosperity crediting their sustenance solely to their technology.

The above lesson reminds us never to forget our limited role in our personal success. We must never forget that Hashem is our true provider and He develops and secures our efforts with their ultimate success.
