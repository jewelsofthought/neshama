     וָֽאֶתְחַנַּ֖ן אֶל־יְהֹוָ֑ה

The parasha opens with the words "I entreated the Lord". Entreat is such a polite word. It has within it "treat", so  I "treat" you to/with something, almost like a bribe so that you will be nice/merciful to me? It has the sense of one who is below another in "power", and wants something from his "king".

[אתחנן]{.heb} comes from the root word [חנן]{.heb} mercy, beneficence, kindness, niceness, annul a sentence.  So, already within its core is the idea of mercy. This, however, being in the reflexive form, speaks of "my mercy" or "the mercy that I receive", or, as is most common, "the mercy that I ask for" and thus we use "entreat". However, being as there is a reflexive tense in this form, as in [אתקלח]{.heb}, as in "take a shower", in English, but actually "to shower myself" in Hebrew. So, perhaps, it is the mercy I have, or I show, or I have received that I ask "to the Lord" with?

In the present, I find it extremely synchronous, to be a time of "entreating the Lord", with an impending eclipse on _Erev Shabbat_, 15th Av! Although traditionally a time of great rejoicing, it is also in this conjunction, a time for "asking for mercy", as the miracle of the moon darkening, and turning red heralds the Shabbat of _Va'Etchanan_.

Now Israel hear the Laws and the Sentences...

… that I will teach you… generally rendered as statutes and judgements, how convenient. What does that actually mean? Well, statutes or laws are generally static agreements that create a societal structure, whereas judgements or sentences are responses or consequences to not carrying out the laws. One could even say that the former is built in the past, whereas the latter, which is built for the future, is expressed in the present. When you transgress (in the present) a law (which has been "created" in the past), then you are sentenced (in the present) to a punishment – that will be carried out in the future. You could also say that the first is static, the second dynamic, and the third is the probable result. Once a law is in place, its expressed through the sentence. This brings us to the other meaning of משׁפט, sentence – literally. It speaks of a spoken (or written) sentence. An understandable proclamation. The voice of the law is its sentence. Is it not interesting that in English has the same double meaning to sentence as in Hebrew? A sentence is "proclaimed". It is like the oral law, which has become fixed, but should actually be fluid.

This also points to the fact that there are the laws (_mitzvoth_) and the practice of these laws (_halakha_).

v4:2]

   <div class='column is-half'>

     You shall not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it, but keep the commandments of your God [יהוה]{.heb} that I enjoin upon you.
   </div>
   <div class='column heb'>
     לֹ֣א תֹסִ֗פוּ עַל־הַדָּבָר֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר אָנֹכִי֙ מְצַוֶּ֣ה אֶתְכֶ֔ם וְלֹ֥א תִגְרְע֖וּ מִמֶּ֑נּוּ לִשְׁמֹ֗ר אֶת־מִצְוֺת֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר אָנֹכִ֖י מְצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶֽם׃
   </div>

G-d states emphatically that "you shall not add anything, nor take anything away from it, but keep the commandments. Yet, we have the Oral Law, a necessary addition to these laws, which should not change any of them, yet have. But what other path was there to take when, for instance, there was no temple to gather and to offer sacrifices in?

It makes me think of the mention of the [fallen angels](/posts/parashot/44-Devarim_depth/index.html#fallen_angels) in the previous parasha
