What is the movement carried out here? Is it that Aharon moved and they copied his  movements? So he "moved" them?

ומניף את הקורבן לארבעה צדדים: מוליך ומביא לארבע רוחות השמים, מעלה לכיוון מעלה, ומוריד לכיוון מטה
(ש"י על ספר במדבר, פרק ה', פסוק כ"ה ובתלמוד בבלי, מסכת מנחות, דף ס"א, עמוד ב', וכן משמע בתלמוד ירושלמי תוספות ש){dir="rtl"}

- When you see the truth, the most difficult thing you have to overcome is not being angry. For it is not that they are lying, but just that they do not see the truth, or see it slanted.

- The wise do not love, for love as we know it is from the ego. The love of the music is not love, but more compassion, for he responds to the essence of the matter, and being void of ego, acts accordingly.

Stemming from the word for sin, _Chet_, I am trying to understand the sense of the word, that is then translated as "cleansed themselves". How did it become that, as this is the reflexive tense, and should be "sinned themselves". This, I ask, "what does that actually mean, to "sin oneself"? On an individual level, is it a process by which I absorb my sin and by this process of reclamation I can be redeemed? Could it be a process of self-loving and thereby forgiveness?

> When you raise light in the lamps . . . toward the face of the menorah (8:2)

<figure class="quote">
  <p> The Holy One, blessed be He, is all light; as it says, "The light dwells with Him" (Daniel 2:22). Yet He said to Israel: "Prepare for Me a candelabra and lamps."
  </p>
  <figcaption>&mdash;(Midrash Rabbah)</figcaption>
</figure>

The idea expressed here is that each one of us should be like a lamplighter who ignites the latent potential within the soul of man which is a lamp of G-d, just as the lamplighter lights the Menorah, which is the lamp of G-d in the Mishkan and which radiates its light and love upon people (from Proverbs 20:27).

The endeavour here is to kind the lamp "so that a flame arises of its own accord." The objective would be to establish him or her as a self-sufficient luminary, a soul whose light shines for and upon us all. The best way to do this is through influencing one's fellow, assisting in developing his talents and abilities so that his lamp independently glows and, in turn, kindles the potential in others. (from The Lubavitcher Rabbi)

<figure class="quote">
The spiritual significance of the _mitzvah_ of lighting the _menorah_ is that one should be a "lamplighter" who ignites that latent potential within "the soul of man, a lamp of G-d".

When the Kohen came to kindle the <i>Menorah</i>'s lamps each afternoon in the Holy Temple, he found them fully prepared for lighting: earlier in the day the lamps had been cleaned and filled with oil, and fresh wicks had been inserted. All he had to do was bring near the flame he carried, so that its proximity to the waiting lamp would unleash the potential for illumination which the lamp already holds.

</details>

Herein lies an important lesson for the spiritual lamplighter. Do not think that you are achieving anything that your fellow could not, in truth, achieve on his own; do not think that you are giving him something he does not already possess. The soul of your fellow is a ready lamp, filled with the purest oil and equipped with all that is required to convert its fuel into a blazing flame. It lacks only the proximity of another lamp to ignite it. If your own soul is alight, its contact with another's soul will awaken its potential for light, so that it may illuminate its surroundings and kindle other souls, in turn. (The Lubavitcher Rebbe)

> And this was the work of the menorah . . . from its shaft to its flowers (8:4)

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    The menorah also represents the Torah, the source of divine light in the world. This is alluded to in the menorah's design, which is detailed in the 25th chapter of Exodus. The menorah had 7 branches, 11 knobs, 9 flowers and 22 goblets, and was 17 hand-breadths in height. These numbers represent the five books of the Written Torah: the first verse in the book of Genesis has 7 words, the first verse of Exodus has 11 words, the first verse of Leviticus has 9 words, the first verse of Numbers has 17 words, and the first verse of Deuteronomy—22 words.

> G-d spoke to Moses . . . in the first month of the second year after they came out of the land of Egypt . . . (9:1)

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    For more than nineteen hundred years now, our Passovers have been incomplete. We eat the <i>matzah</i> and the bitter herbs, we drink the four cups of wine, ask and answer the four questions; but the heart and essence of Passover, the Passover offering, is absent from our Seder table. For G-d has hidden His face from us—has removed the Holy Temple, the seat of His manifest presence on physical earth, from our midst.
</p><p>
G-d desires and expects of us that we refuse to reconcile ourselves to the decree of <i>galut</i> and its diminution of His manifest involvement in our lives. He desires and expects of us that we storm the gates of heaven with the plea and demand: "Why should we be deprived?!"

> If any man of you, or of your future generations, shall be unclean . . . or be on a journey afar off, he shall keep the Passover to G-d on the fourteenth day of the second month... (9:10–11)

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    The meaning of the "Second Passover" is that it is never too late; there is always a second chance.
  </p>

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>

    Why was the mitzvah of the "Second Passover" not commanded directly by G-d in the Torah from the very start, as were virtually all other <i>mitzvot</i>?
</p><p>
Because the Second Passover represents the power of <i>teshuvah</i>—the power to "return" and rectify past failings and transform them, retroactively, into merits. This cannot derive from Torah itself, since Torah, which defines what is desirable and undesirable in the eyes of G-d, cannot regard a failure to fulfil a divine command as something "positive." The <i>mitzvah</i> of the Second Passover could come only as the divine response to the profound yearning of a soul superseding "Torah," as it were, crying out for attachment to G-d from a place so deep within itself that it transcends failing and merit, and can therefore reach back to transform the failing into merit.

> And at times it was that the cloud abode from evening until morning . . . then they journeyed (9:21)

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    The Sanctuary was a formidable structure, consisting of hundreds of foundation sockets, wall sections, pillars, tapestries and furnishings; a work crew of several thousand Levites assembled the Sanctuary at each camp, and dismantled and transported it when the divine command would come to move on. Yet the "Tent of Meeting" was erected at every encampment—even if only for a single day!
</p></p>
This teaches us that each and every one of our "stations" in life is significant unto itself. A person may find him- or herself in a certain place or in a certain situation for a very brief period, and it may seem to him that he is merely "on the way" to some other place. Yet there is always something in that place or situation to be sanctified—something that can serve as a "Tent of Meeting" between heaven and earth.:

> We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt (11:5)

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    Rav and Shmuel differed as to the meaning of this. One says it means fish. The other says it is an idiom for forbidden sexual relations... This is also the meaning of what is says further on, "Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families"—they were weeping over the incestuous relations that were now forbidden them.:

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    The Lubavitcher Rebbe illustrates the deeper significance of the "free fish" of Egypt with the following parable:
</p><p>
A wealthy nobleman was once touring his estate, and came upon a peasant pitching hay. The nobleman was fascinated by the flowing motions of the peasant's arms and shoulders, and the graceful sweep of the pitchfork through the air. He so greatly enjoyed the spectacle that he struck a deal with the peasant: for ten rubles a day, the peasant agreed to come to the mansion and enact his hay-pitching technique in the nobleman's drawing room.
</p><p>
The next day the peasant arrived at the mansion, hardly concealing his glee at his new line of work. After swinging his empty pitchfork for over an hour, he collected his ten rubles—many times over his usual wage for a week of labour. But by the following day, his enthusiasm had waned. Several days later, he announced to his master that he was quitting his new commission.
</p><p>
"But I don't understand," puzzled the nobleman. "Why choose to swing heavy loads in the winter cold and summer heat, when you can perform such an effortless task in the comfort of my home and earn many times your usual pay?"
</p><p>
"But Master," said the peasant, "I don't see the work.":

> And I will emanate of the spirit which is upon you, and will bestow it upon them (11:17)

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    Was Moses' prophecy perhaps diminished? No. This is comparable to a burning candle from which many candles are lit, yet its own light is not diminished. So, too, Moses lost nothing that was his.:

Note: &nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>
</summary>

On the most basic level, this is the difference between physical and spiritual giving. In physical giving, the giver's resources are depleted by his gift &mdash; he now has less money or energy than before. In spiritual giving, however, there is no loss. When a person teaches his fellow, his own knowledge is not diminished &mdash; if anything, it is enhanced.

Upon deeper contemplation, however, it would seem that spiritual giving, too, carries a "price." If the disciple is inferior to the teacher in knowledge and mental capability, the time and effort expended in teaching him is invariably at the expense of the teacher's own intellectual development; also, the need for the teacher to "coarsen" and simplify his ideas to fit the disciple's mind will ultimately detract from the depth and abstraction of his own thoughts.

By the same token, dealing with people of lower moral and spiritual level than oneself cannot but affect one's own spiritual state. The recipients of this "spiritual charity" will be elevated by it, but its giver will be diminished by the relationship, however subtly.

Indeed, we find an example of such spiritual descent in Moses' bestowal of the leadership upon Joshua. In contrast to the appointment of the seventy elders, where he was told to "emanate" his spirit to them, Moses is here commanded to "take Joshua the son of Nun, and lay your hand upon him . . . and give of your glory upon him" (Numbers 27:18–20). Here the Midrash comments, "Lay your hand upon him—like one who kindles a candle from a candle; Give of your glory—like one who pours from one vessel into another vessel."

In other words, there are two kinds of spiritual gifts: a gift that "costs" the giver nothing ("emanation," which is like "kindling a candle from a candle"), and a gift that involves a removal of something from the giver in order that the recipient should receive something ("pouring from one vessel into another").

There are times when we indeed sacrifice something of ourselves for the benefit of a fellow. But there are also times when we commit ourselves to our fellow so absolutely—when the gift comes from a place so deep and so true within us—that we only grow from the experience, no matter how much we give of ourselves.

Moses &nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>

Blessed is the name of our Holy Sage, the _Besht_. May his gifts be with us forevermore. He continues the above quote with the following sentence: "Moses, however, was able to see G-dliness even when awake—for him the material world did not conceal." Far from me to question his words, but I must express my irk at this constant reminder that there is the average man and then there is the Superior Man - in this case Moses - who reaches such a level of perfection that it will be unattainable by any "normal" man. But was what Moses, named by an Egyptian Priestess, but a "normal" child, who was granted glimpses into G-d's Kingdom. Thus, is it not possible that another "normal" child might be blessed in the same way, or is what happened to _Moshe Rabbeinu_ a one time event?
