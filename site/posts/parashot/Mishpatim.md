## Chapter 21

- There is no separate realm of religion. Religion should impact and exist in all areas of life (para 1).
- Civil law is an extension of the 6th commandment (covet)
- These ordinances are mainly about avoiding damage to others
- The laws must be placed before them in their fullness!

2 problems:

1. spread: In a lawless land any law is better than none. Even if roughly hewn, it would be of benefit. And now?
2. All these ordinances are heavily based on witness testimony - which only works in a Community of Truth.
  [{**Note**: The virtualisation of the world removes human witnesses. We believe that the evidence from a picture or video is more accurate than witness testimony - but the same standard of truth is required. What if the video/photo is faked?}]{.note}

n28-32] The property or injury needs to adhere to market value for final restitution.

n25] Different forms of injury
**נזק** - loss of value
**צער** - pain
**רפוי** - medical cost
**שֶׁבֶת** - loss of income
**בושׁת** - humiliation (Deut. 25:11)

**ואלה המשׁפתים אשׁר תשׂים לפניהם** - to whom is He speaking?

23:15] 3 festivals: appear before א

- Festival of _Matzos_: 7 days, month of Springtime.
- Festival of Harvest: first fruits of your labour
- Festival of Ingathering: close year, gather in your work from the fields

23:21] Angel to protect you. Being that I have made ready.

## Chapter 24

To Moses: Aaron, Nadab, Abihu + 70 elders ascended to G-d: **עלה אל־יהוה**

Moses spoke to people:
**כל הדטרים אשׁר דבר יהוה נעשׂה**

- Moses wrote words of Hashem, then read "Book of Covenant" to the people containing all these ordinances.

This is where we say:  **נעשׁה ונשׁמע**

- 4 + elders saw God(s) of Israel
- Sapphire brick work, and the essence of heaven

<p dir="rtl">כמעשׁה לבנת הספיר כעצם השׁמיים לטהר</p>

did not stretch His hand against the elders : לא שׁלח ידו
gazed at G-d "cannot look at My face", yet ate and drank (assumedly in His company): <bdo dir="rtl">אצילי בני ישׂראל</bdo>

**Note**: This _parasha_ is part of a larger narrative that began with _Yitro_, in which we were given the Ten Commandments, the high point of the narrative and our journey. It then continues through _Terumah_, _Tetzavah_ till _Ki Tisa_ &mdash; which is where the evil deed occurs, thus representing the true low point of the story. In _Terumah_ are the explicit instructions regarding the building of the altar. In _Tetzaveh_ are the details of the dress of the High Priest. _Ki Tisa_ details the utensils that will be in the _Mishkan_. It emphasises the Sabbath, and then, in chapter thirty-two, we build the Golden Calf. {.note}
