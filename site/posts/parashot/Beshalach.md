## Foreward

Finally, Pharaoh relents and let's the Children of Israel go. But this is not the end of the story. It seems that, in Pharaoh's mind, he is still negotiating the three days of worship that was originally requested. But by this time the Children of Israel are heading into the Sinai desert with Moses at their lead.

## Hardening of Heart

<blockquote dir="rtl">
אני הכבדתי את לבו 
</blockquote>
A strange twist in the tale. G-d Admits to "hardening his (pharaoh's) heart". Why would He Do that?

We pray to G-d hoping that He Will clear the way for us, and when He Does not Do that, we respond with anger and despair.

Why would He Harden pharaoh's heart? Well, perhaps, after so many generations of slavery, the people needed something momentous to shift their perception, to make them open to receiving a new way of living, and, even more difficulty, a new perspective.

The lesson needed to be engraved in the not only the current generation, but deep enough to affect many generations to come. And to cut that deep requires something extraordinary (in the {(ordinary mind)[ordinary.htmlj] - the mind that cannot conceive of any extra-ordinary!

## Long road

The message here is that when there is opposition, the shortest path is not always the best. This is the lesson of the {[straight line](straight_line) One straight line between any two points, yet an infinite amount of curved lines. }

Not through the Philistines, rather the Way of the Wilderness (מדבר) {Interesting, that it is translated as wilderness - for it is related to both speaking and desolation. // Philistine -> Palestine? פלשׁתים means sojourner, or immigrant - the map of Philistia includes Gaza, which is similarly situated, and similarly a thorn in the side of the modern Israeli state... what an interesting replay.}

Just liberated from hundreds of years of slavery, yet when faced with מלחמה/challenges, they wish to turn back.

Better take the long road: to get as far away from the previous situation as possible. Like an alcoholic, no bars, no drinking buddies.

Yet they were armed: חמושׁים - word unclear. Did we even know how to fight? If so, how? Who trained us? If not - why take the arms? It says we took the arms when we took the gold & silver... so what was left for the Egyptian army that chased us?

Plagues and death of the first-born were insufficient to convince us of G-d's might. It was necessary to destroy Pharaoh & his army.

No records of this in Egypt. Well, history is told by the victors. This must have been an extremely humiliating defeat for the Egyptians - they might have left it out. How many defeats are celebrated on the tombs?

On Shabbat: all work on/for the temple ceases - and we pray. We are to spend time in Divine space. It is easiest if there is a communal space of prayer, but it can be anywhere, though that is difficult, fraught with challenges and is best if done in a group of 10 (men?).
Alone is the most challenging and will test your commitment to its limits.

15:26 Come Place of Bitterness: מרה. They found water, but it was bitter. Moshe Rabeinu throws a tree into the water to sweeten it. Then G-d tests us: I will establish a decree חוק and an ordinance משׁפת

<blockquote dir="rtl">

> So he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood; he threw it into the water and the water became sweet. There He made for them a fixed rule, and there He put them to the test.

> He said, “If you will heed the LORD your God diligently, doing what is upright in His sight, giving ear to His commandments and keeping all His laws, then I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians, for I the LORD am your healer.”

Food is the key. (Q. Kashrut) -> integrate the alchemy of science so that we may evolve with this deeper, more expressive physical/spiritual(imaginary) entanglement As the gap between science and the truth (for G-d is Truth) decreases, so our understanding of the true dynamics of the universe increases, bringing us closer to balancing these two aspects of our human experience: the real and the miraculous/unreal/imaginary.

We wish neither to break nor challenge any foundation. We look at QK as being a superset of Kosher. We just wish to bring it into alignment with the information we now have regarding our foodstuffs and the effects on our bodies and minds. Regular meat can be labelled Quantum Kosher, but only Kosher meat can be labelled Kosher. But Quantum Kosher Kosher meat include the requirement that it be natural, and not laden with unnecessary chemicals, or treated in an beastly fashion. Thus you could envision even _Hallal_ meat that is QK labelled. The point being that the QK requirement for all their food is as stringent as the kosher requirement for all Jews.

Plague: Is a way to separate those who have faith from those who lack faith. For if He sees our deepest thoughts and knows our true desires, would not a plague expose the hidden in our hearts? In our time, the virus becomes a messenger of G-d, an angel - just as it is known as a genetic (mRNA) messenger.

16: Complain again: There will always be the faithless amongst us, no matter how many miracles they observe, yet still they do not see the truth! They only see what is in front of them (1d). How many moves ahead can you see? Some see two or three moves ahead. It is said that the maximum is serven. A prophet then is one who see into that future.

How far does the golden thread of your life stretch?

16:4 - Interesting this pattern: Hashem talks to Moses, Moses and Aaron speak to the children of Israel and then Moses calls the people to assemble. The Glory appears in a cloud... Is this another cloud, or the one in which the angel rode? This is the Glory of G-d, not G-d, else Sinai is not the first time the people are in the presence of G-d.
They do not tremble and fear this time. However, the Cloud addresses Moshe Rabeinu, and not the people.

Manna:

- 1st principle: Take what is sufficient for the day, no more, so that there will be enough for all! Else the excess (waste) just rots and stinks.
- Sabbath practice for the first time - yet it is pre-Torah.
  - no gathering of food
  - stay at home (with family)
  - and rest

40 years of eating stuff that was like snow on the ground. That must have been difficult. For the next generation they know of no other food. It must have been almost monkish, this life. But to have eaten food from G-d all your life, must have been uplifting.

What happened to all the animals they took with them? Were they all used..?

<p class="note">
{Note 17-18: Esau hated his father, Jacob? Why?}
</p>

17: Complain - for the 3<sup>rd</sup> time

<blockquote dir="rtl">
וַיִּקְרָא֙ שֵׁ֣ם הַמָּק֔וֹם מַסָּ֖ה וּמְרִיבָ֑ה
</blockquote>

> Called the place "Trial and Quarrel"

And the essential existential question regarding G-d appears:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
הֲיֵ֧שׁ יְהֹוָ֛ה בְּקִרְבֵּ֖נוּ אִם־אָֽיִן
</blockquote>

> "Is HaShem present or not?"

Does G-d exist? If He does, does He care?

Then Amalek arrives - as if in response to the complaining people. Now they REALLY have something to complain about - a war with Amalek.

Who was Hur חור? He held Moshe Rabeinu's arms above his head for the batter.

Nice phrase for the Throne of G-d: כס יה

R' Chananel via R' Bachya: Exodus as a schooling in faith.
Have faith in the prophecy/message, each in his own way.

15: Song!
Water: marks the end of our (this) bondage to Egypt: ים סוף

18: Armed: R' Bachya: People should conduct themselves in a natural manner, and G-d will intervene as necessary!

R' Hirsh: Speak of lack of hear to leave one's slavery.
Rashi: Only one-fifth left. However, they died in the plague of darkness If this is the case, then I ask: How did this affect the other people, when four out of five of their friends and family members died? Did Egyptians die in this plague too? Or only Israelites? What transpired in the time between this plague and the final plague of the first-born?

14: Camp at the Mouth of Freedom: פי החִירת

֨## Faith and Love

    Can you love someone you have no faith in?
    Isn't that the end of love, when you lose faith in your love
    Then you forego love.
