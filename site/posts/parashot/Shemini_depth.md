_It came to pass on the eighth day (9:1)_

<figure class='quote'>

That day took ten crowns: It was the first day of creation (i.e., a Sunday), the first for the offerings of the nesi’im (tribal heads), the first for the priesthood, the first for [public] sacrifice, the first for the fall of fire from heaven, the first for the eating of sacred food, the first for the dwelling of the Divine Presence in Israel, the first for the priestly blessing of Israel, the first day on which it was forbidden to sacrifice to G‑d anywhere but in the Sanctuary, and the first of months.

The number seven represents the cycle of creation; the number eight represents the “circumference”—that which lies beyond the perimeter of time and space. This is why the Divine Presence came to dwell in the Israelite camp on the eighth day. This is also alluded to in the saying of our sages (Talmud, Erchin 13b) that “the lyre of Moshiach has eight strings.”

_Moses said: “This is the thing which G‑d commanded you to do; and the glory of G‑d shall appear to you” (9:6)_

<div class="note">

Which is to set up the sanctuary for the Divine Presence to rest in it. In the Torah are specific instructions on how to do that. In this day and age, these instructions do not fit the reality we are presently in. What are our alternatives?

The one obvious one is the one our sages directed us in, and that is to make sanctuaries of our homes, and have temples in every community.

## The fire consumed them

_Nadav and Avihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer . . . and they died before G‑d (10:1–2)_

<figure class='quote'>
  
“They came close to G‑d and died” (Leviticus 16:1)—they approached the supernal light out of their great love of the Holy, and thereby died. Thus they died by a “Divine kiss” such as experienced by the perfectly righteous; it is only that the righteous die when the Divine kiss approaches them, while they died by their approaching it. . . . Although they sensed their own demise, this did not prevent them from drawing near to G‑d in attachment, delight, delectability, fellowship, love, kissing and sweetness, to the point that their souls ceased from them.

_A fire went out from G‑d and consumed them (10:2)_

<figure class='quote'>
  
But subsequently it says that Moses instructed Mishael and Eltzafan, “Carry your brothers from before the Sanctuary,” and “they carried them out in their robes”? . . . G‑d sent forth two threads of fire into each one’s nostrils and consumed their souls, without touching their flesh and without touching their clothes.

_Moses said to Aaron: “This is what G‑d spoke, saying: I will be sanctified in those who are close to Me . . .” (10:3)_

<figure class='quote'>
  
This was said to Moses at Sinai, but its meaning was not known to him until the occurrence happened, when Moses said to Aaron: “My brother! At Sinai, G‑d said to me: ‘I will sanctify this House, and through a great man I will sanctify it,’ and I thought that either through me or through you would this House be sanctified; but now I see that your two sons are greater than you or I.”

_Aaron was silent (10:3)_

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    Said Rav Papa: The merit of attending a house of mourning lies in the silence observed.

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    In youth, one learns to talk; in maturity, one learns to be silent. This is man’s problem: that he learns to talk before he learns to be silent.
  </p>
  <figcaption>&mdash;(Rabbi Nachman of Breslov)</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class='quote'>

Speech signifies comprehensibility. Melody is beyond language, expressing moods which words cannot describe. Silence is yet higher.

The power to be silent at certain moments of life and of history is an important strength. It expresses the awareness that G‑d is infinite, and cannot be encapsulated in our human conceptions of what should take place.

The Talmud tells of an instance in which Moses himself was told by G‑d to be silent. G‑d showed him in a vision all future generations of the Jewish people, and the leaders of each generation. Moses was greatly impressed by the wisdom of Rabbi Akiva. Then he saw the way the Romans tortured him to death. “Is this the reward of his Torah knowledge?” Moses asked. G‑d answered: “Be silent. Thus it arose in My thought.”

This is not to say that the Torah advocates a fatalistic approach to life. Before the event, one must do everything possible to prevent tragedy. But once it has happened, G‑d forbid, through the acceptance and the silence we reach a special closeness to the Divine. Our sages tell us that because Aaron was silent, he was rewarded by G‑d speaking directly to him.

In our generation, too, there is a need for this power of silence. It is not a passive power, but one that leads to vigorous and joyous action. The Jewish response to the harrowing events of the Shoah is the determined and energetic action to rebuild Jewish family life and Jewish knowledge.

Through our power of silence we too, like Aaron, will merit Divine revelation. G‑d will bring the Messiah, rebuilding the Temple and bringing lasting peace to the world.

_And that you differentiate between holy and the profane . . . and that you instruct the children of Israel (10:10–11)_

Though Rashi relates this to the drinking of wine in rendering a Torah judement, what if this was actually core teaching of the Torah? To differentiate between holy and profane!{.note}

_Moses heard this, and it was favorable in his eyes (10:20)_

<figure class='quote'>
  
There are seven things that characterize a boor, and seven that characterize a wise man. A wise man does not speak before one who is greater than him in wisdom or age. He does not interrupt his fellow’s words. He does not hasten to answer. His questions are on the subject and his answers to the point. He responds to first things first and to latter things later. Concerning what he did not hear, he says “I did not hear.” He concedes to the truth. With the boor, the reverse of all these is the case.

<figure class='quote'>
  
The great Kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria taught that every created thing possesses a “spark” of divine energy that constitutes its essence and soul. When a person utilizes something toward a G‑dly end, he brings to light this divine spark, manifesting and realizing the purpose for which it was created. In all physical substances, a material “husk” (_kelipah_) encases and conceals the divine spark at its core, necessitating great effort on the part of man to access the spark without becoming enmeshed in the surface materiality.

No existence is devoid of a divine spark—indeed, nothing can exist without the pinpoint of G‑dliness that imbues it with being and purpose. But not every spark can be actualized. There are certain “impregnable” elements whose sparks are inaccessible to us. The fact that something is forbidden by the Torah means that its husk cannot be penetrated, so that its spark remains locked within it and cannot be elevated.

This is the deeper significance of the Hebrew terms _assur_ and _mutar_ employed by Torah law for the forbidden and the permissible. _Assur_, commonly translated as “forbidden,” literally means “bound,” implying that these are things whose sparks the Torah has deemed bound and imprisoned in a shell of negativity and proscription. _Mutar_ (“permitted”), which literally means “unbound,” is the term for those sparks which the Torah has empowered us to extricate from their mundane embodiment and actively involve in our positive endeavors.

The “bound” elements of creation also have a role in the realization of the Divine purpose outlined by the Torah. But theirs is a “negative” role—they exist so that we should achieve a conquest of self by resisting them. There is no Torah-authorized way in which they can actively be involved in our development of creation, no way in which they may themselves become part of the “dwelling for G‑d” that we are charged to make of our world. Of these elements it is said, “Their breaking is their rectification.” They exist to be rejected and defeated, and it is in their defeat and exclusion from our lives that their raison d’être is realized.

The example used is one of kosher and non-kosher meat. This is the bound element. But what if you don't eat meat?{.note}

_These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales (11:9)_

<figure class='quote'>

The student of Torah is comparable to a fish in water, as in Rabbi Akiva’s famous parable. His “fins” are the means by which he moves forward through the water—the intellect and study skills with which he advances in wisdom and increases the Torah and makes it great with his own contributions (chiddushim) to Torah learning. His “scales” are his protective armor against predators and adverse elements—his fear of heaven, which shields his learning from error and distortion.

One might think that the primary requirement for success in Torah is the “fins,” while the “scales” serve a secondary function. It is the fins that move the fish forward, while the scales merely preserve what is. After all, learning is an intellectual exercise; piety and fear of G‑d are lofty virtues, but are they any use in navigating the complexities of a difficult Tosafot?

In truth, however, the very opposite is the case. A scholar with “fins” but no “scales” is a non-kosher fish. He might swim and frolic with his talent and genius, but his learning is corrupt; it is not Torah, but his egoistic arrogation of the Divine wisdom. On the other hand, the Talmud tells us that while there are fish with fins and no scales, all fish with scales have fins. If a person approaches Torah with an awe of its Divine author and the commitment to serve Him, he will certainly succeed. Regardless of the degree of his intellectual prowess, he will find the “fins” with which to advance in his learning and contribute to the growth of Torah.

_Any earthen vessel into which any of them fall . . . shall be unclean (11:33)_

<figure class='quote'>

If the source of impurity enters within the space of an earthen vessel—even without touching its walls—it becomes impure. If it did not enter into it, even if it touched it from the outside, it remains pure.

With all other utensils, the opposite is the case: entering within them alone does not make them impure, while touching any part of them does.

<figcaption>&mdash;(Talmud, Chullin 24b; Rashi)</figcaption>

The worth of a utensil of wood or metal is not only in its function as a container—the material of which it is made also has value. So contact with any part of it, including its outside surface, affects its ritual state. On the other hand, an earthen utensil, whose body is mere earth, has value only as a container; accordingly it is affected only by what happens to its inside. Indeed, its inside is therefore even more susceptible to contamination than that of other utensils.

Man is an earthen vessel (“G‑d formed man out of the dust of the earth, and He blew into his nostril a living soul”—Genesis 2:7). His worth lies not in his material exterior, but in its content. He should therefore regard as significant only what pertains to his inner self.

_A wellspring or pool (mikvah) . . . shall be pure (11:36)_

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>

A wellspring purifies regardless of the amount of the water it contains, and also when flowing; a mikvah purifies only when stationary, and must contain 40 se’ah (approx. 87.5 gallons) of water.

<figcaption>&mdash;(Torat Kohanim)</figcaption>

When a person endeavors to venture forth on his own, relying on his own intellect and feelings to guide him in the proper path, he had best be well equipped for the task. For he is then a mikvah, a pool of water no longer in direct contact with its source, which must possess a minimum of so many “gallons” of understanding and fortitude. Furthermore, he must be “stationary,” contained and delimited by walls outside of himself, for without such objective control he is susceptible to all sorts of distortions and corruptions. A mikvah that lacks these criteria not only fails to purify other things, but is also itself vulnerable to contamination.

On the other hand, one who is a “wellspring,” disavowing all pretensions of a “separate identity” from his Source, has no such limitations. His intellect may not be the deepest, his talents quite unspectacular, but the little he has can effectively take on the most challenging of tasks. Nor does he require any confining walls or “closed communities” to safeguard his integrity: wherever he goes and flows, he has a positive effect on his environment and is never negatively influenced by its imperfections. For no matter how scant his resources, and no matter where he ventures forth, he maintains an unbroken attachment to his Source.
