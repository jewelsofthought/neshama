[משׁכן]{dir="rtl"}, generally translated as the Tabernacle, means a dwelling place. It is meant to be a resting place for G-d's Presence amongst us. Where and how could we manifest such a space today?

Actually, the idea that such a place could exist is revolutionary in its own right. Most of the pagan beliefs contained a place (like, in heaven) where the G-d's resided. Upon occasion they would decide to descend and mess with humans, but they had no dwelling place here on earth, especially not the "king of the gods"

v2] _Terumah_ - Uplifting

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
ב דַּבֵּר֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְיִקְחוּ־לִ֖י תְּרוּמָ֑ה מֵאֵ֤ת כָּל־אִישׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִדְּבֶ֣נּוּ לִבּ֔וֹ תִּקְח֖וּ אֶת־תְּרֽוּמָתִֽי:
</p>
  <p>
2. "Speak to the children of Israel, and have them take for Me a <em>terumah</em>; from every person whose heart inspires him to generosity, you shall take My offering.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**NOTE**: A _terumah_ means an offering in this context, but also has the meaning of “uplifting”. Thus, in common parlance, one might say, something like: "Speak to the children of Israel, that they should bring to Me something that will lift me up, i.e., honour me &mdash; and through honouring me, will be 'uplifted'."{.note}

    The verse does not say “and I will dwell within it,” but “and I will dwell within them” &mdash; within each and every one of them.

_Terumah_, a donation, to the _Mishkan_, the container in which the Ark of the Covenant was kept. This _parasha_ consists of detailed instructions on the building of the _Mishkan_ for the Jewish people.

This is a call to build a place for G-d's presence on this plane of existence. It is the same call that we hear today. For that is what we still need to do.

This _mishkan_ is not made from brick and mortar, but from specific materials, and defined by cloth. It can be carried around - thus saying that G-d is not necessarily in need of a static place. That is, its location is not the criterion for His residence on earth, but its qualities - the manner in which it is built and the manner in which the ceremonies of sacrifice and attendance are carried out.

Thus, in the desert it was a tent. In Jerusalem, it was a temple, from which it morphed into synagogues - allowing Jews in exile to continue our special relationship with G-d. Perhaps there is another iteration that is possible.

There is much to point to this in the writings regarding the temple of the Messianic age. For that is the time when the Upper Temple will be manifest in the lower worlds.

There are many projections of an upper (4th) dimensional object into the present (3rd) dimension we experience our lives in. This is how it will be, defined by spirit, and not by material. For that is the shift.

We need to build a [temple](https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1167/jewish/The-Answer-to-the-Mother-of-All-Questions.htm) for G-d to reside in. We need to make/create space in our lives where the Divine resides.

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    Every created entity has a spark of G‑dliness within it, a pinpoint of divinity that constitutes its “soul,” its spiritual function and design. When we utilize something to serve the Creator, we penetrate its shell of mundanity, revealing and realizing its divine essence. Thus we elevate these “sparks,” reuniting them with their Source.

v3-7] **Offerings** "you shall take"

**List of offerings:**

- gold, silver & copper;
- turqoise, purple & scarlet linen & goat hair;
- red-dyed ram skins & wool;
- _tachash_ skins & acacia wood;
- oil for illumination, spices for the oil & aromatic incense;
- _shocham_ stones; stones for the _ephod_ & breastplate of the High Priest;

**NOTE**: Quite a shopping list!{.note}

v8] **Sanctuary**

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
ח וְעָ֥שׂוּ לִ֖י מִקְדָּ֑שׁ וְשָֽׁכַנְתִּ֖י בְּתוֹכָֽם:
</p>
  <p>
1. And they shall make Me a sanctuary and I will dwell in their midst
  </p>
</blockquote>

v10-21] Form of the **Ark** and its **cover**

At this stage, we receive a detailed description of the tabernacle and the various vessels and implements needed.

One point that is brought up, that I think is important, is that we must remember that the Temple was build for the Tabernacle &mdash; which came first &mdash; rather than the other way round.

v22] **Meetings** here

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
כב וְנֽוֹעַדְתִּ֣י לְךָ֘ שָׁם֒ וְדִבַּרְתִּ֨י אִתְּךָ֜ מֵעַ֣ל הַכַּפֹּ֗רֶת מִבֵּין֙ שְׁנֵ֣י הַכְּרֻבִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־אֲר֣וֹן הָֽעֵדֻ֑ת אֵ֣ת כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֧ר אֲצַוֶּ֛ה אֽוֹתְךָ֖ אֶל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל:
</p>
  <p>
22. I will arrange My meetings with you there, and I will speak with you from atop the ark cover from between the two cherubim that are upon the Ark of the Testimony, all that I will command you unto the children of Israel.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**NOTE**: This is in stark contrast to the modern day. Now we have Neil Walsh's <cite>"Conversations with God"</cite>, where it is a conversation between him and G-d, whereas here it is the place where G-d will, through Moses, let the people of Israel know what his commandments are.{.note}

**NOTE**: What do they cherubim really look like? In fact, what are they really?{.note}

**NOTE**: If the cherubs are angels, is not one of the commandments just given to us by G-d for us not to make such representations, especially not in the Holy Temple?

v23-40] Form of the **vessels**

v23-30] [שׁולחן]{dir="rtl"} (_shulchan_) - Table

This was the workbench/altar with sacred objects on it, different from the altar where the sacrifices took place. The first is a "static" altar, a place in time, whereas the second is moving/dynamic/functional altar, where sacrifices occur

v30] Showbread

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
ל וְנָֽתַתָּ֧ עַל־הַשֻּׁלְחָ֛ן לֶ֥חֶם פָּנִ֖ים לְפָנַ֥י תָּמִֽיד:
</p>
  <p>
30 And you shall place on the table showbread before Me at all times.
  </p>
</blockquote>

n30] **showbread**: Heb. [לֶחֶם פָּנִים]{dir="rtl"}, lit., bread of faces.

Showbread &nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>
</summary>
<p>
NOTE: I was wondering about the name showbread, thinking that it was just for show, and could not be eaten. However, bread of faces, might be even more interesting. Especially, since I am not satisfied with Rashi's explanation that it was know by this appelation because of the two "walls" that were baked on either side.
</p>
</details>

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
     The bread was made in the shape of a type of box without a cover. It had a flat bottom (Men. 94b) and it would be bent upward on both sides [forming something] similar to walls. Therefore, it is called [לֶחֶם הַפָּנִים]{dir="rtl"}, literally, the bread of faces, because it has faces looking in both directions-toward the sides of the house (<em>Mishkan</em>) from here [in one direction] and from there [in the other direction]. A golden form and an iron form were made for it. It was baked [on Fridays] in the iron form, and when it was taken out of the oven, it would be placed in the golden form until the next day, which was the Sabbath, when it would be arranged on the table. That form is called <span dir="rtl">קְעָרָה</span>

v31-40] [מנורה]{dir="rtl"} (_menora_) - Candelabra

It calls to the upper light to illuminate the darkness for us.
  
**NOTE**: Enlighten me if I am wrong, but the Menorah is associated with Hanukkah in the popular mind.

## Chapter 26

We continue with the various ornaments, and structures, etc. that are to be in the Tabernacle. Like the covers of the Ark (v1-14), the walls of the Tabernacle (v15-30) and the _Parochet_ ([הַפָּרֹ֨כֶת֙]{dir="rtl"}), the curtain that separates the Holy of Holies from the rest (v31-33).

v33] _Parochet_ ([הַפָּרֹ֨כֶת֙]{dir="rtl"}) - Curtain

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
 וְהִבְדִּילָ֤ה הַפָּרֹ֨כֶת֙ לָכֶ֔ם בֵּ֣ין הַקֹּ֔דֶשׁ וּבֵ֖ין קֹ֥דֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִֽׁים:
</p>
  <p>
 ...the dividing curtain shall separate for you between the Holy and the Holy of Holies.
  </p>
</blockquote>

## Chapter 27

v1-8] [ארון]{dir="rtl"} (_aron_) - Altar

The altar is empty, unless **HaShem** fills it. It is where the blood services and sacrifices take place.

v9-19] The Courtyard

## Haftorah:  (Kings I 5:26 - 6:13)

The _haftorah_ is, appropriately, about Solomon building the "House" of the Lord. What stands out for me is first Solomon builds the brick and mortar version of the House. Whereupon the "Word of the Lord" comes to Solomon, in which He says: If you walk in my statutes, execute my ordinances and keep all My commandments... then I will dwell amongst My people.

Even as late as the time of Solomon, whether G-d dwelt amongst us or not was dependent on us walking, executing and keeping His instructions. It was a not a done deal. It was a dynamic relationship. Just as a marriage can be broken by people not keeping their vows, so this relationship is dependent on OUR behaviour.

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
יא וַֽיְהִי֙ דְּבַר־יְהֹוָ֔ה אֶל־שְׁלֹמֹ֖ה לֵאמֹֽר:
</p><p>11. And the word of the Lord came to Solomon saying,
</p>
<p dir='rtl'>
יב הַבַּ֨יִת הַזֶּ֜ה אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֣ה בֹנֶ֗ה אִם־תֵּלֵ֚ךְ בְּחֻקֹּתַי֙ וְאֶת־מִשְׁפָּטַ֣י תַּֽעֲשֶֹ֔ה וְשָׁמַרְתָּ֥ אֶת־כָּל־מִצְו‍ֹתַ֖י לָלֶ֣כֶת בָּהֶ֑ם וַהֲקִמֹתִ֚י אֶת־דְּבָרִי֙ אִתָּ֔ךְ אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּ֖רְתִּי אֶל־דָּוִ֥ד אָבִֽיךָ:
</p><p>12. (Concerning) this house which you are building, if you walk in My statutes, and execute My ordinances, and keep all My commandments to walk in them; then will I establish My word with you, which I spoke to David your father.
</p>
<p dir='rtl'>
יג וְשָׁ֣כַנְתִּ֔י בְּת֖וֹךְ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְלֹ֥א אֶעֱזֹ֖ב אֶת־עַמִּ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל:
</p><p>13. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people, Israel.
</p>
<p>

## Notes

### Listening, speaking, and acting

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
     The <em>Gemara</em> (<em>Megillah</em> 18a) says, <em>“A word is worth one <em>sela</em> (coin). Silence is worth two.”</em> Perhaps the <em>Gemara</em> alludes to the speak-half-as-much-as-you-know rule:  for every word you speak, make sure it is accompanied by two measures of silence. Only half of what we think in our heads, should actually be articulated.
<p></p>
Sometimes we must be called upon to ring clearly, and make our views known, like a bell. But other times, silence must reign. We must hold back the thoughts that could be potentially hurtful or unhelpful. There is tremendous power in silence.
<p></p>
From the tension of speaking and silence, emerges action. [<b>NOTE</b>: From the tension of sound and silence comes music.]{.note}
<p></p>
This triad of speaking, silence and action is a methodology that we must each employ when advocating for change. For righting wrongs, and bringing justice to our world. When we try to better our world, and continue God’s creative work, we must know when to speak out. We must know when not to talk, to remain silent, and control the anger, and frustration within us. And then, we must know when to act. To turn the sounds and silences into action.
<p></p>
There is a time to talk out; a time to remain silent; a time to act.
  </p>

### The Name

G-d is the name of everything that is NOT man-made. This includes nature, and the so-called "Laws of Science", which are actually G-d's laws that science has discovered. Or, more accurately, a language, which we call science, that expresses the "natural/empirical" laws, making them accessible to anyone who is willing to learn the language that deals with that particulate. Thus making them accessible to a far larger segment of the population

### [אַמָּה]{dir="rtl"} (Ammah) "a cubit"

Derived from [אם]{dir="rtl"} - mother.

This word we have rendered as a cubit has a strange derivation. I realise it would be bending the accepted meaning, but what if it did mean something else. Perhaps there is other information we can receive from this word - not just 17.5 inches long...

It derives from mother, as in a parent, as well as in something like a mother-city. The word, without vowels, can mean nation as well. It is almost always used in the singular, and in 15 cubit long, though there is a plural. There is also one rendition in (Is or Job?) that no one knows its meaning. It is used once to refer to the foundation of the tent. What if it is not a linear measurement?

Even if it was, and there were men like Goliath (who was supposed to be about 9 feet tall) and his ancestors who once walked the earth (perhaps referred to as the _Annakim_ in the bible), and they, being much larger, could have first used an _Ammah_ to measure. Even if this was the length of a forearm, perhaps it was a much larger one...

### Israel vs. Jew

The name Jew derives from _Yehuda_, the eldest son of Jacob, and is often used to refer to the Jewish people, as a nation. However, often the nation is referred to as the sons of Israel, or the nation of Israel - not his son, Judas.

This is the question I ask, in light of the previous, is whether we are accurate assessing the meaning of the word "cubit".

### Practical Man

Many times have I struggled over these parochial pieces in the Torah. Lists of names, countless counting, and here, the exact measurements of the _Mishkan_, in an extremely detailed description of every piece that was to be in it, its materials and its form. {How come no one has reproduced it since - even in movies? Perhaps because we are not yet ready to?} This will appeal to the literal man's mind. The man of action, a builder, not a dreamer.

Here is the classic divide between the "simple" man, the man who lives his life according to what is in front of him, and the "dreamer", the mystic whose focus is on the other world. The split between _Halacha_ and Kabbalah, between Confucianism and Taoism. This is the part of the Torah that he can relate to, and thus engage in discussion about. Though if we try to fit this literal version into reality, it soon begins to show strain. For instance, how could the whole nation come together in such a small space, if there were two-million or so souls in the desert? How could one sacrifice that amount of animals during the festival on an alter that was only X-cubits long by Y-cubits wide? How long would this take? Think of the immense amount of blood that must have been shed.
