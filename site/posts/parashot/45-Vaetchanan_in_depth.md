    G‑d is the exclusive source of life; hence life, by definition, is connection with G‑d. A "life" of disconnection from G‑d is pseudo-life—life devoid of all but its most superficial illusory shell.

If G-d is the exclusive source of life, then your life, by definition, is defined by your connection with G‑d. Thus, a life of disconnection from G‑d is pseudo-life — life devoid of meaning and purpose, except for its most superficial illusory shell.

In fact:

**There is none else beside Him (4:35)**

  <p>
    If the eye were allowed to see the spiritual vitality flowing from the utterance of G‑d's mouth into every creation, we would not see the materiality, grossness and tangibility of the creation, for it would be utterly nullified in relation to this divine life-force . . .

If, for one moment, our minds could see the spiritual vitality flowing from the utterances of G‑d's mouth into every creation,
we would be able to see through the materiality, grossness and tangibility of the creation, for it would be utterly irrelevant in relation to this divine life-force.

**In the heavens above and the earth below (4:39)**

<figure class='quote'>

Surely we know that the heavens are above us and that the earth is below our feet; why couldn't the Torah, whose every word and letter is measured, simply say "in the heavens and the earth"?

But here is a lesson in how we are to approach the heavenly and earthly aspects of our own lives. In all that pertains to the heavens, to our spiritual achievements, we must look upwards, to those greater than ourselves, and strive to emulate them. But as regards our earth, our material possessions and attainments, we must look below us, to those who have less than we do, and be grateful for what we have.

**You shall know today (4:39)**

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    The foundation of all foundations, and the pillar of all wisdom, is to know that there is a First Existence, who brings all existences into being; that all existences of heaven and earth, and between them, derive existence only from the truth of His existence.
  </p>

This is the font from which all true religions are nourished. This is the foundational rock upon which all spiritual quests are based.

**You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal (5:17)**

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    When Moses ascended to heaven, the angels protested to G‑d: "What is a human being doing among us?"

Said He to them: "He has come to receive the Torah."

Said they to Him: "This esoteric treasure, which was hidden with You for nine hundred and seventy-four generations before the world was created, You wish to give to flesh and blood? . . . 'What is man, that You are mindful of him, and the son of man, that You take notice of him? . . . Place Your glory upon the heavens!'" (Psalms 8:2–5)

Said G‑d to Moses: "Answer them."

Said Moses: "Master of the Universe! I fear they might consume me with the breath of their mouths."

Said G‑d: "Hold on to the Throne of Glory, and return them an answer."

Said Moses: "Master of the Universe! This Torah that You are giving to me, what is written in it? 'I am the L‑rd your G‑d, who has taken you out from the land of Egypt.'"

"Have you descended to Egypt?" asked Moses of the angels. "Have you been enslaved to Pharaoh? So why should the Torah be yours?

"What else does it say? 'You shall have no other gods.' Do you dwell amongst idol-worshipping nations? What else does it say? 'Remember the Shabbat day.' Do you work? . . . What else does it say? 'Do not swear falsely.' Do you do business? What else does it say? 'Honor your father and your mother.' Do you have parents? What else does it say? 'You shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal.' Is there jealousy among you? Do you have an evil inclination?"

Straightaway the angels conceded to G‑d . . . and each one was moved to befriend Moses and transmit something to him. Even the Angel of Death, too, confided his secret to him . . .

**With a great voice which was not again (5:19)**

<figure class='quote'>
  
  The Hebrew phrase _velo yasaf_, which we have translated "which was not again," can also mean "which did not cease." Thus there are various meanings to this verse. One meaning is that the revelation at Sinai was a one-time event, never to be repeated in history (_Rashi; Ibn Ezra_). Other meanings are: that it was an extremely powerful voice that spoke without interruption (unlike a human voice, which must pause for breath (_Targum; Rashi_); that it did not cease, in the sense that all subsequent prophets prophesied from that voice, or in the sense that it did not confine itself to the Holy Tongue but reverberated in mankind's seventy languages (_Midrash Rabbah_); that it did not "repeat"—i.e., it had no echo (_Midrash Rabbah_).

**_olam hazeh_ and _olam haba_**

<figure class='quote'>
  
  Thus we have "the present world" (_olam hazeh_) and "the world to come" (_olam haba_) &mdash; two entirely different modes of existence, each confined to a world all its own. Our "present world" is the stage for deed and achievement, but without the possibility to enjoy the true fruits of our labour. On the other hand, the "world to come" is a place of ultimate reward, bliss and perfection, but one that precludes any further achievement on the part of man. The Talmud goes so far as to declare, "There is no reward for _mitzvot_ in this world," and regarding the world to come it quotes the verse (Ecclesiastes 12:1), "There will come years of which you will say: I have no desire in them," and says: "This refers to the days of the messianic era, in which there is neither merit nor obligation."

Why this dichotomy? Because a world in which the benefits of obeying G‑d's commandments are self-evident would lack the challenge which makes their observance meaningful and worthy of reward. Conversely, a world in which the goodness of G‑d is manifest precludes truly meaningful accomplishment on the part of man. Thus our sages have said: "A single moment of _teshuvah_ and good deeds in this world is greater than all of the world to come. And a single moment of bliss in the world to come is greater than all of this world"
