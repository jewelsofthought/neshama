This is a reading that contains much information. It is said that the majority of the Torah's essential laws are contained within this _parasha_.

19-1-4] **Holiness, parents, Shabbat, and Idols**

<mark>&nbsp; It was G-d's will to rest His Presence among the Jewish people so that it could rise to its calling to be a holy nation of His servants (_Exodus_ 19:6)</mark>. In order to make this possible, Israel was enjoined to avoid the spiritual contaminations that would result from the sexual and religious practices listed in the previous chapters. This <em>Sidrah</em> explains that <mark>the reason for these prohibitions is to make it possible for the nation to become holy by emulating its creator as much as possible. Furthermore, </mark>, and the way to do this is by scrupulous adherence to the commandments found on the first table fo the Ten Commandments &mdash; but these commandments demand more than a minimal observence. For instance we are exhorted that the prohibition against idolatory inclues not only acts of worship, but anything that shows the credence or respect, event when there could be some personal gain in doing so (<em>Sforno</em>).

n19:2] [כּל־עְָרַת בני־ישׂראל]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _The entire assembly of the Children of Israel_.

The majority of the Torah's essential laws are contained here, either explicitly or by allusion (_Rashi_; _Sifra_). _Maharzu_ explains that the essential laws are the Sabbath, reverence for parents, the prohibition against stealing, and taking revenge or bearing grudges, and the commandment to love one's fellow. [**Question**: Nothing about chastity and sexual purity?]{.note}

_Alshich_ explains that Moses called all the people together to impress upon them that the _mitzvos_ are encumbent everyone equally. Judaism does not subscribe to the idea that "holy people" are obligated in commandments that do not apply to "ordinary" people, or that they have a greater responsibility than others to observe them scrupulously. Thus the command to be holy applies to everyone, and this being so, it is axiomatic that every Jew has the potential for holiness.

19:2] [קדֹשׁים תִהְִוּ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall be holy_
[The root [קֹדֶשׁ]{dir='rtl'}{dir='rtl'}, _holy_, because it is on a different spiritual plane from the secular. At the oppisite end, an immoral person is called a [קֹדֶשׁ]{dir='rtl'}, because his spiritual degradation sets him apart from moral people. The injuction to be holy calls upon us to avoid the illicit relationships described, because where there is separation from immorality, there is holiness (_Rashi_; _Vayikaa Rabbah_ 24:6).

_Ramban_ maintains that the concept of holiness is an admonition that one's approadch to <mark>all aspects of life be governed by moderation</mark>, particularly in the area of what is permitted. Someone who observes only the letter of the law can easily become [נָבָל בִרְשׁוּת הַתּורה]{dir='rtl'}, _a degenerate with the permission of the Torah_, for such a person can observe the technical requirements of the commandments while surrendering to self-indulgence, gluttony and licentiousness. The commandment to be holy [קַדַּשׁ עַצְמְךָ בְּמֻתָר לָךְ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Sanctify yourself in what is permitted to you_ (_Yevamos_ 20a).

n19:3] [אִמּוֹ וְאָביו תִּירָאוּ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Your mother and your father shall you revere_. _Reverence_ or _fear_ means that one should act towards his parents as he would toward a sovereign with the power to punish those who treat him disrespectfully (_Rambam_; _Sefer HaMitzvos; Chinuch_). Specifically, the commandment prohibits a child from sitting in his parents' regular places, interrupting them, or contradicting them [in an abrupt or disrespectful manner]. _Honour_ refers in general to serving one's parents. (_Rashi_; _Sifra_).

n19:4] [אַל־תִּפְנוּ אֶל הָאֵלִילִם]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _ֹ Do not turn to the idols_. Having exhorted all Jews to show regard for their three partners &mdash; G-d, father and mother &mdash; who brought them into being, the Torah forbids anyone to add false dieties to this partnership.

This verse prohibits the very thought of such worship (_Rashi_). It also prohibits the study or discussion of the rites and philosophies of idoltary (_Rambam, Hil. Ovdei Kochavim_ 2:2). Human nature &mdash; and history &mdash; demonstrate that many people have thought they were strong enough to control their thoughts and desires, only to become ensared by the very creed they railed against.

[חלֶּל]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Has he desecrated_. A person who disregards the laws that specify when an offering may be eaten implies that he considers the sacrificial meat to be nothing more than a means of gratifying his appetite (_Haamek Davar_).

**Note**: This, I believe, has been extended to the meals we eat.{.note}

n19:5-8 **Piggul/Rejected offerings**. This teaches us that it is not enough to carary out the commandments mechanically; one must perform them with the right inentions as well (_Sforno_).
This illustration the more sacred something is, the more seriously the Torah regards the infraction. Thus, only an offering that was perfect in every other way can become _piggul_. Similarly, the better a person's reputation and the more responsible his position, the more he must guard against even the slightest infraction (_R' Yaakov Kamenetsky_).

n19:9-10 **Gifts to the poor**. We have been commanded to emulate G-d's holiness to whatever extent possible. G-d is merciful and charitable, so it stands to reason that He should command His people to display the same sort of kindness... Then it continues with laws of honest business dealings.

A Jew must discharge his responsibilities to others before his own.

n19:10 [וּפֵרֶט]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _And the fallen fruit_. The poor are entitled to take one or two pieces of fruit &mdash; but not three &mdash; that fall during the harvest (_Pe'eh_ 6:5, 7:3).

**Question**: How would it be possible to monitor this?{.note}

n19:11-15 **Honest dealings with others**. Stealing, robbery, false oaths, and so on are never the norm in an entire nation; if they were, society would break down. But there are other, subtler manifestations of such sins,. It is not at all uncommon for a society to be lax in its ethics. People may look forways to decieve others, to deny obligations that cannot be proven, to invoke G-d's Name to convince others that lies are true, to underpay labourers, or to seek personal gain through unctuous flattery.

n19:11 [לוֹ תִּגְנֹבו]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall not steal_. The prohibition applies not only to the person actually commiting the sin, but also to those who aid and abet it or make false accusations, such as: a witness who remains silent though he has seen a theft, or knows that someone is witholding property, and someone who falsely claims money that is not owed him, or unjustifiably demands an oath (_Ibn Ezra_).

n19:12 [וְחִלַלְתָּ אֵת־שֶׁם]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Thereby desecrating the name_. Someone who swears falsely demonstrates that he has no respect for G-d's Name (_Ibn Ezra_).

n19:13 [לֹא־תַעְַשׂק]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall not cheat_, by depriving a worker of his earnings (_Rashi_; _Sifra_), or by deceitfully or forcibly witholding anything belonging to another person (_Rambam_, _Sefer HaMitzvos_).

n19:14 [וְלִפְנֶי עִוֶר]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Before the blind_. In additional to its literal meaning, it means allegorically that one should not give bad advice to an unsuspecting person, especially if the advisor stands to benefit from the other's error (_Rashi_; _Sifra_). It is also forbidden to cause some to sin (_Rambam_, _Sefer HaMitzvos_). The message is we are responsible for the welfare of others and may not to anything to undermine it.

n19:15 [לֹא־תַעְַשׂוּ עָוֶל]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shal not commit a perversion_. A person who judges falsely is guilty of a perversion of justice and what he has done is an abomination (_Rashi_).

n19:16 [לֹא־תֵלֵךְ רָכִיל]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall not be a gossipmonger_. It is forbidden to tell someone what others have said or done behind his back, if there is even the slightest possiblity that it may cause ill will.

The word [רָכִיל]{dir='rtl'} is related to [רוֹכַל], _peddler_, because a gossip goes from house to house "peddling" his slander and gossip (_Rashi_).

n17 [לֹא־תִשְׂנַה...בִּלִבָבֶךָ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall not hate...in your heart_. Even though he has wronged you, think of him as _your brother_ and do not fall prey to hatred (_R' Hirsch_).

n18 [לּא־תִקֹּם וְלֹא־תִטֹּר]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudge_. Revenge consists of retaliating against someone who has displeased you, by attempting to do him some harm, or by refusing to do him a favour that you would normally have done. Even if someone does not retaliate, it is forbidden to bear a grudge. G-d wants us to purge the insult or misdeed from our hearts (_Rashi_; _Ramban_).

<span class="icon is-pulled-left"><i class='fa fa-star-of-david' aria-hidden='true'></i></span>

**Love your fellow.**

[וְאָהַבְתָּ לְרַעָךָ כּמוֹךָ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall love your fellow as yourself_. This is the fundamental rule of the Torah (_R' Akiva_; _Rashi_; _Sifra_). "What is hateful to you, do not do to others" (_Hillel_; _Shabbos_ 31a). For instance, a husband may not put his wife into situations that might make her distateful to him (_Kiddushin_ 41a; _Niddah_ 17a).

_Ramban_ explains that it is impossible for all but the saintliest people to feel the same love for others that they fell for themselves. The Torah does not demand that. Rather, G-d demands that we want others to have the same degree of success and prosperity that we want forourselves and that we treat others with respect and consideration.

_R' Avraham Yehoshua Heschel of Kopitchinitz_ used to say that the commandment to love your fellows does not mean to love saintly and righteous people &mdash; it is impossible not to love such people. G-d commands us to love even people whom it is _hard_ to love.

<span class="icon is-pulled-left"><i class='fa fa-star-of-david' aria-hidden='true'></i></span>

**How to love another**

1. Your affection for other should be real, not forged.
2. Always treat others with respect.
3. Always seek the best for them.
4. Join in their pain.
5. Greet them with friendliness.
6. Give them the benefit of the doubt.
7. Assist them physically, even in matters that are not very difficult.
8. Be ready to assist with small or moderate loans and gifts.
9. Do not consider yourself better than them.

n19 **Kil'ayim/Forbidden mixtures**. God created the world with certain distinct species, and His wisdom decreed that these species remain intact and unadulterated. For man to take it upon himself to alter the order of Creation suggest a lack of faith in G-d's plan. Moreover, each species on Earth is directed by a Heavenly force, so that the earthly species represent profound spiriutual forces. To tamper with them is to cause harm that earth-bound man cannot fathom.

It should be noted that these laws of mixtures are limited to specific matters, and do not limit the infinite numbers of alloys and combinations that are so much a part of modern life. To the contrary, man is duty bound to improve the world and, in sense, "complete"  the work of Creation.

n27 [לֹא תַקפּוֹ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall not round off..._. This refers to the removal of hair from the sideburns area &mdash; the edges &mdash; of the head. One is forbidden to remove this hair, thereby making a straight line from the hairline behind the ear to the hairline in front of the head. Were one to do so, the hair at the top of the head would look as if it were rounded off. [One transgresses by removing at least two hairs from this area] (_Rashi_).

[וְלֹא תִשְׁחִית]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _And you shall not destroy_. There are five edges of the beard, each of which is forbidden to shave (_Rashi_). But, since these areas are not clearly defined, it is forbidden to shave the entire beard.

It is forbidden to remove the sideburns even by means of plucking or with scissors. Regarding the beard, however, the Torah forbids one to _destroy_ it and to _shave_ it (21:5). This is interpreted by the Sages to mean the use of a razor, meaning an implement that both shaves [גִּלּוּחַ]{dir='rtl'} and "destroys" by cutting to the level of the skin [הַשְׁחָתָה]{dir='rtl'} (see _Yoreh De'ah_ 181:3,10).

n28 [וְשֶׂרֶט לְנֶפֶשׁ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _A cut...for the dead_. It was an ancient custom for people to cut their flesh in mourning for the dead. It is forbidden because _You are children to_ **HaShem** (_Deuteronomy_ 14:1), implying that it is a disgrace to G-d for His children to inflict wounds on their body as signs of mourning.

**Question**: Is this not a general rule as well &mdash; not to inflict wounds on our body, and for the same reason?{.note}

v29: Harlotry

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
כט. אַל־תְּחַלֵּ֥ל אֶת־בִּתְּךָ֖ לְהַזְנוֹתָ֑הּ וְלֹֽא־תִזְנֶ֣ה הָאָ֔רֶץ וּמָֽלְאָ֥ה הָאָ֖רֶץ זִמָּֽה:
</p>
  <p>
29: You shall not defile your daughter by making her a harlot, lest the Land fall into harlotry and the land be filled with immorality.
  </p>
</blockquote>

n19:29 [אַל־תְּחַלֵּל אֶת־בִּתְּךָ לְהַזְנוֹתָהּ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall not defile your daughter by making her a harlot_.  [This is speaking of] a person who hands over his unmarried daughter to have relations that are not for the purpose of marriage (_Torath Kohanim_ 19:77; _Sanhedrin_ 76a).

n19:29 [אֶל־תְּחַלֵל]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Do not profane_. _Rashi_ and _Sifra_ comment that the outcome of such treacherous conduct &mdash; [וְלֹא־תִזְנֶה הָאָרֶץ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _lest the land become lewd_ &mdash; is that the earth itself will become guilty of harlotry, and
it will be unfaithful to its people, causing its fruits to go astray ([מְזַנֶּה]{dir="rtl"}), producing them elsewhere and not in your Land.

.  as it says ([_Jeremiah_ 3:2-3](https://www.chabad.org/16000#v2))"  "and you defiled the Land with your harlotries ([בִּזְנוּתַיִ]{dir="rtl"})…] Therefore, the rains were withheld” (_Torath Kohanim_ 19:77).

n19:30 [שַׁבְּתֹתַי]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _My Sabbaths..._ Both the Sabbath and idolary are reckoned as equal to all the commandments in the Torah. Idol worship is a clear denial of G-d. Sabbath desecration, too, is a denial that G-d created for six days and rested on the seventh &mdash; the eternal reminder of G-d as the Creator (_Rambam_).

[וּמִקְדָּשִׁי תִּירָאוּ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _And revere My Sanctuary._ One may not enter [the Temple Mount] with his [walking] staff, his shoes, with his money belt, or with the dust on his feet (_Yev_. 6b).

v31:

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
לא. אַל־תִּפְנ֤וּ אֶל־הָֽאֹבֹת֙ וְאֶל־הַיִּדְּעֹנִ֔ים אַל־תְּבַקְשׁ֖וּ לְטָמְאָ֣ה בָהֶ֑ם אֲנִ֖י יְהוָֹ֥ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶֽם:
</p>
  <p>
31: You shall not turn to [the sorcery of] Ov or Yid'oni; you shall not seek [these and thereby] defile yourselves through them. I am the Lord, your God.
  </p>
</blockquote>

n19:31 [אַל־תִּפְנ֤וּ אֶל־הָֽאֹבֹת֙ וְאֶל־הַיִּדְּעֹנִ֔ים]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Do not turn to the Ovos and Yid'onim_. These are magical practices that purport to foretell the future.

And what are these forms of sorcery? One who practices the sorcery of _Ov_ is “Pithom the sorcerer” (see _Rashi_ [_Deut_. 18:11](https://www.chabad.org/9982#v11)); [he communes with the dead, as it were, by raising the spirit of the dead, which then] speaks from his armpit. [And one who practices the sorcery of] _Yid’oni_ inserts the bone of a creature called _Yido’a_ (see _Bartenura_, _Mishnah Kilayim_ 8:5) into his mouth, and the bone speaks [from there] (_Torath Kohanim_ 19:79; _Sanh_. 65b).

[אֲנִי ה' אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶֽם]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _I am the Lord, your G-d_. Be aware Whom you are discarding in order to pursue knowledge of the future by turning to the prophets of _Ov_ and _Yid'oni_.

n19:32

[מִפְּנֵי שֵׂיבָה]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _In the presence of an old person_. The _halachah_ holds that one is to rise and honour anyone over the age of seventy, even if he is not learned, and to rise for and honour a sage, even if he is young (_Yoreh De'ah_ 244).

n19:33

[גֵּ֣ר]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _A proselyte_. It is forbiddent to taunt a proselyte to by reminding him of his non-Jewish past, suggesting this makes him unfit to study G-d's Torah (_Sifra_).

n19:34 [כִּֽי־גֵרִים הֱיִיתֶם]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _for you were strangers_. Do not accuse your fellow man with your own defect (_B.M._ 59b).

n19:35-36 **Weights and measures**. The Torah likens a person doing business to a judge, and someone who falsifies weights and measures is like a judge who perverts judgement.It teaches that one who falsifies his weights and messures is considereed as if he denies that there is a G-d Who sees all (_Chofetz Chaim_)

## Chapter 20

<span class="icon is-pulled-left"><i class='fa fa-star-of-david' aria-hidden='true'></i></span>

**Punishments**

The Torah does not decree a physical punishment for a sin unless there is a negative commandment enjoining us not to commit that deed.

n20:2-5 [מֹּלֶךְ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Molech_. Scripture says, “There shall not be found among you] anyone who passes his son or daughter through fire” ([_Deut_. 18:10](https://www.chabad.org/9982#v10)).

n20:4 [וְאִם הַעְלֵם יַעְלִימוּ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _But if [the people of the land] ignore [that man]_.  [The double expression intimates that] if they ignore one matter [i.e., even one sin and avert their eyes], they will eventually ignore many matters. Only if the courts and the people are consistent can they function properly (_Rashi_; _Or HaChaim_).

v20:7

<blockquote>
<p dir='rtl'>
ז. וְהִ֨תְקַדִּשְׁתֶּ֔ם וִֽהְיִיתֶ֖ם קְדשִׁ֑ים כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י יְהוָֹ֖ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶֽם:
</p>
  <p>

7: You shall sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am the Lord, your God.

  </p>
</blockquote>

n20:7-8 [וְהִתְקַדִּשְׁתֶּם]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _You shall sanctify yourselves_. One who refrains from idol worship sanctifies himself.

The sequence of verses alludes to the teaching that the very thought of idol worship &mdash;' he merely _turns_ to it (verse 6) &mdash; is regarded by G-d as if someone had actually worshipped idols (_Kidushim_ 39b). But how can someone control his thoughts? Therefore the Torah teaches that it is incumbunt upon every Jew to attempt to sanctify himself by performing the commandments and by avoiding evil to the best of his abilty. G-d promises that in reward for his sincere efforts, [והְיִיתֶם קְדוֹשִׁים]{dir='rtl'}, _and you will be holy;_; G-d will assist him in cleansing his thoughts(_Be'er Yitzchok_; _Meshech Chochmah_).

n20:9 [דָּמָיו בּֽוֹ]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _His blood is upon himself_. This refers to [the death penalty by] stoning. Simply, it means that the violateor brought the punishment upon himself, “his blood is upon his [own] head” ([_Josh_. 2:19](https://www.chabad.org/15786#v19)).

n20:10 [מֽוֹת־ימות]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Shall be put to death_.  Wherever a death penalty is mentioned in the Torah without specification [as to the mode of death], it exclusively refers to strangulation (_Torath Kohanim_ 20:106; _Sanh_. 52b).

n20:22-24 **The Land and immorality**. The gift of the Holy Land is conditioned upon the people maintaining their high level of sanctity.

n20:25-26 **Holiness and Kashrut** The chapter concludes with an exhortation to avoid forbidden foods, as a prerequisite to holiness (see 11:44).

n20:26  [וָֽאַבְדִּל אֶתְכֶם מִן־הָֽעַמִּים לִֽהְיוֹת לִי]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _And I have distinguished (separated) you from the peoples, to be Mine_. If you are separated from them [through your observance of Torah], you will be Mine, but if not, you will belong to Nebuchadnezzar and his ilk. If you are separated from them [through your observance of Torah], you will be Mine, but if not, you will belong to Nebuchadnezzar and his ilk. R' Eleazar ben Azariah taught: "Do not say, 'I find pork disgusting.' Rahter you should say, 'I would like to savour pig meat, but what cna I do &mdash; G-d forbade it, and commanded me to separate myself fro the nations in order to be Hs, and to accept His sovereignty upon myself. If we do _not_ sanctify ourselves, then the _nations_ will separate us from their midst &mdash; for persecution and expulsion, G-d forbid.

n20:27 [א֛וֹב א֥וֹ יִדְּעֹנִ֖י]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Ov or Yid'oni_.  If Israel serves G-d properly, it will deserve to have prophets and will have no need for these magical ways of foretelling the future (_Baal HaTruim_).
