"Behar" means "on/at the Mountain [Sinai]"

## Chapter 25

This portion is essentially about the [_Shemittah_](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/562016/jewish/Shemitah.htm), the Sabbatical year, which is the year of rest, just like the Shabbat is a day of rest. Every seventh year all work on the land ceases, and its produce becomes free for all to take, man and beast.

### v25:4-5] _Shemittah_

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ד. וּבַשָּׁנָ֣ה הַשְּׁבִיעִ֗ת שַׁבַּ֤ת שַׁבָּתוֹן֙ יִֽהְיֶ֣ה לָאָ֔רֶץ שַׁבָּ֖ת לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה שָֽׂדְךָ֙ לֹ֣א תִזְרָ֔ע וְכַרְמְךָ֖ לֹ֥א תִזְמֹֽר:
</p>
<p>
4. But in the seventh year, the land shall have a complete rest a Sabbath to the Lord; you shall not sow your field, nor shall you prune your vineyard.
</p>
<p dir="rtl">
ה. אֵ֣ת סְפִ֤יחַ קְצִֽירְךָ֙ לֹ֣א תִקְצ֔וֹר וְאֶת־עִנְּבֵ֥י נְזִירֶ֖ךָ לֹ֣א תִבְצֹ֑ר שְׁנַ֥ת שַׁבָּת֖וֹן יִֽהְיֶ֥ה לָאָֽרֶץ
</p>
<p>
5. You shall not reap the aftergrowth of your harvest, and you shall not pick the grapes you had set aside [for yourself], [for] it shall be a year of rest for the land.
</p>
</blockquote>

Specifically, you may not "sow you field, nor prune your vineyard". Additionally, you "shall not reap the aftergrowth of your harvest", not pick the grapes you had set aside for yourself."

<div class="note">

**N**: It seems that only certain agricultural work is forbidden, that which requires "sowing the field", which is essentially grains. It also seems that grapes are not to be pruned? As far as the produce that is available to all, it is also from the leftover grains, and the grapes - that you set aside for yourself.

So what is allowed? Could one plant grapes? One can continue to produce fruits and vegetables. In additional, besides the restricted agricultural work, all other forms of work are permitted, like doctors, or metalworkers, etc.

Essentially it is the grains and grapes (which produce wine) that are affected.

Then seven Sabbatical years are followed by a fiftieth &mdash; the [Jubilee](https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/4386805/jewish/10-Jubilee-Facts-to-Know.htm) year, when all work on the land ceases, all indentured servants are set free, and all ancestral estates in the Holy Land that have been sold, revert to their original owners. This is the year following the of the 7th _shemittah_. "And you shall count for yourself seven sabbatical years, seven years seven times" [[v8](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)].

Then, G-d goes into details as the purchasing of the land that will be
affected by the Jubilee. However, in His detailing there is a constant reminder to not do wrong by your fellow Jew.[[v14](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en),[v15](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en),[v17](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)]

**N**: The execution of the _shemittah_ contains a number of issues. The first is that the harvest in the sixth year must be a bumper harvest, as the people are not going to have freshly grown food for over a year. Let it be so.

It also affects the price of things, especially of land. The land value will be affected by the closeness to the _shemittah_.

Another issue is that it is uncertain where and when this was consistently practised. There is a possibility that it has never been implemented.

Of course, the people ask: "What are we to eat in the seventh year, if we may neither sow nor gather in our crops?" G-d responds that he will "yield a crop sufficient for three years" [[v22](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)
</div>

Some details:

[[v25](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)] "If one of your kin is in straits and has to sell part of a holding, the nearest redeemer, i.e., the closest relative able to redeem the land. shall come and redeem what that relative has sold."

Then, additional laws overseeing the sale of lands, laws against [fraud](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/803455/jewish/Are-Jews-Allowed-to-Steal.htm) (in business) and charging interest ([usury](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4108763/jewish/Moneylending-and-Jewish-Law.htm)) are introduced.

### Usury

[[v37](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.35-37?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)] "do not exact advance or accrued interest, i.e., interest deducted in advance, or interest added at the time of repayment. but fear your God. Let your kin live by your side as such."

v25:38]

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
לח. אֲנִ֗י יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹ֣הֵיכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁר־הוֹצֵ֥אתִי אֶתְכֶ֖ם מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם לָתֵ֤ת לָכֶם֙ אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן לִֽהְי֥וֹת לָכֶ֖ם לֵֽאלֹהִֽים:
</p>
  <p>
38. I am the Lord, your God, Who took you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, to be a God to you.
  </p>
</blockquote>

### v25:39-55] Slaves

**N**: What is amazing for the time, is that there were some laws regarding the treatment of slaves.

v25:47-55] Treatment of a Jew that is sold to another Jew.

Ending with:

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
נה. כִּי־לִ֤י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ עֲבָדִ֔ים עֲבָדַ֣י הֵ֔ם אֲשֶׁר־הוֹצֵ֥אתִי אוֹתָ֖ם מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם אֲנִ֖י יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶֽם:
</p>
  <p>
55. For the children of Israel are servants to Me; they are My servants, whom I took out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord, your God.
  </p>
</blockquote>

## Chapter 26

v26:1-2] Idols & Sabbath

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
א. לֹא־תַֽעֲשׂ֨וּ לָכֶ֜ם אֱלִילִ֗ם וּפֶ֤סֶל וּמַצֵּבָה֙ לֹֽא־תָקִ֣ימוּ לָכֶ֔ם וְאֶ֣בֶן מַשְׂכִּ֗ית לֹ֤א תִתְּנוּ֙ בְּאַרְצְכֶ֔ם לְהִשְׁתַּֽחֲוֹ֖ת עָלֶ֑יהָ כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶֽם:
</p><p>
1. You shall not make idols for yourselves, nor shall you set up a statue or a monument for yourselves. And in your land you shall not place a pavement stone on which to prostrate yourselves, for I am the Lord, your God.
<p dir="rtl">
ב. אֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַ֣י תִּשְׁמֹ֔רוּ וּמִקְדָּשִׁ֖י תִּירָ֑אוּ אֲנִ֖י יְהֹוָֽה:
</p>
  <p>
2. You shall keep My Sabbaths and fear My Sanctuary. I am the Lord.
  </p>
</blockquote>
