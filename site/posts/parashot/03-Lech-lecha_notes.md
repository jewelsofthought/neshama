- Traumatic move from Haran
- Married, no children - which is a concern
- But has given birth to a substantial household
- Sarai and the pharaoh
  - [יסכּה]{.heb} _Iscah_ = Sarai - which means "my princess"
  - [סכּה]{.heb} _saka_ -> see, gaze, see the future. Everyone gazed at her beauty.
  - 9 years between Abraham and Sara

- 2 boys, Abrahan and Nahor, grow up together, with 2 girls, Sara and Milcah (מלכּה & שׂרה)
  - Abraham 9, Haran 18, marries and gives birth to Sarai;
  - Nahor, the younger, marries Milcah

- Terach, who is a priest of Ur-Kadesh, has problems with the King and Priesthood of the place.

- Terach settles in Haran
  - Abraham 75 years old and still childless
  - Something niggling at Abraham
  - Hears calling. G-d speaks to him,
  ”לך לך”
- Abraham completes journey to Canaan
  - with all the souls they had created
  - takes family (him & Lot & Sarai?)
  - "moves his business" to Canaan

- Enters Holy Land
  - G-d speaks to him
  - "You have been chosen"
    **N**: [What does that mean? How to relate it to our present situation?]{.note}

- Circumcision
  - Why not some other mark?
  - **N**: I suppose it is better than sacrificing them?{.note}

- Abraham sees child being sacrificed.
- "You sacrifice a living child to a dead god. You are sacrificing the living to placate the dead.
- Feeding off the dead, because you are killing something that is alive
- The living G-d would not require such a sacrifice to propitiate Him.

{I read his story and investigate what happened to cause the family (Terach, etc) to leave so suddenly. Something must have happened.}

Terach, priest -> why Canaan?
Abraham studied under him.
At Haran, Terach expresses (often) his regret at not going to Canaan.
God speaks to Ab. Some he feels (because Sarai barren) needs to go to Canaan (to fulfill his destiny).
Leaves with all his disciples.
Journey to Canaan
Arrive => G-d appears to him and says "All this land is yours. To your offspring I will give this land."

I as an descendent of Abraham, thus the offspring G-d speaks of, hear G-d's voice and the land He speaks of is not that of the land that emerged from the waters, but is the land of light, the Aether.

It is not a (single) temple of brick and mortar either that we need to build. But a temple of the spirit, or rather, a spiritual temple, created by the Light that gives life, that will spawn all the land that the waters uncovered, and the waters of the seas with all their seething life, and the air where the eagle and all the birds fly free.

It is a temple that is based on One Truth, that All is One. Coming from One Source, with One Purpose, and One Life, bless be all of creation, and to be grateful and celebrate all life and all existence. Halleluyah.
