## Introducton

Tracking the relationship of our patriarchs with G-d, we find that in the story of Joseph G-d hardly features, except as it says in the beginning of Joseph's narrative &mdash; "G-d was with him".

Early in the beginning of this narrative, G-d appears to Moses (at 80 years of age, though). And they remain close throughout Moshe Rabeinu's life. However, Moshe is a complex character. He is know as supremely humble, yet right from the start argues with G-d.

One of the commentaries mentions that Joseph tried to keep the Hebrews separate from Egypt, but after his death the Hebrews tried to assimilate, but were instead enslaved. Thus, it is necessary to keep the people separated. However, modern Israel has tried to assimilate, and this has just enabled the rise of anti-semitism, and anti-Israeli sentiments, as predicted.

## Notes

### Chapter 1

n1-7] **Righteous generation passed**

{Jacob's son's are deemed meritorious, even after selling Joseph and lying. They rose to become spiritually pure! No punishment, no repercussions or redemption necessary. They become pure enough to prevent the enslavement of our people while they were still alive. The grandchildren were not.

This speaks of an incredibly swift ascent of moral integrity of the brothers. Yet it occurs one step at a time, over time. Remember over 40 years have passed.}

&mdash; **Likened to starts**

"He counts them when they come out and when they are gathered in".

{What a lovely concept of stars. Firstly as emissaries of G-d. Secondly, that He knows each by name. In this age, we distance ourselves from the stars, although we might explore them scientific in exhaustive detail, they do not play a significant part in most of our lives &mdash; even those scientists who study them day in and day out. Most of us have excluded them from any but the most superficial influence. Even astrology is dismissed in our time.

&mdash; **Twelve constellations**

<div class="note">

The number 12 has appeared as an important number in a many ancient cultures. Today we are left with some of them. As in $$360^O$$ in a circle; or 24 hours to the day, 60 seconds to the minute, 60 minutes to the hour; 12 inches in a foot.

The twelve constellations are the same twelve that form the basis of astrology. This is an example of Judaism perhaps absorbing teaching from foreign source and using them to influence and elucidate the text.
&mdash; from Gur Aryeh {What year?}

{ **Evolution**

The theory of evolution is not incorrect. However, it is rather a progression from the simple to the more complex.

- In order for a body to manifest, cells needed to exist. Cells needed nutrients &mdash; which are molecular, and molecules are made up of atoms, which themselves are made up of sub-atomic "particles".
- In other words, it had to built up from the bottom up, stage by stage &mdash; a carefully orchestrated sequence of events. The 1st stage had to be completed before the next stage.
- That is why it states in Genesis "Day one, the second day ... it was good, the third day ... it was good, etc." That the ordinal was used, speaks of a sequence of days. That it was good speaks to the need for each stage to be complete before the next took place. What the evolutionary scientists call a "successful" evolution, is those that survived. However, they do not really know why the one succeeded and the other failed. The answers they have found are most times clutching at straws, and ignoring the obvious exceptions to the general idea of the "survival of the fittest" &mdash; as evidenced by the peacock, or the giraffe... how did the giraffe know to grow two hearts?

**Simple**

Perhaps the whole realm of the quantum, which we perceive as so complex is actually something much more simple, that, because we can only see a slice thereof, would seem far more complex and erratic than it actually is. One could also express this as that the mathematics necessary to solve this equation we do not yet have. Like the deceptively simple $$ e = mc^2 $$ could be ascertained. After a complex mathematical road, we arrive at a decidedly simple statement. Energy and mass (with light) are equivalent. One could derive from this that mass is actually light &mdash; whereas energy includes both that which we call mass (a measurable and light). In essence it consists of a real part and an "imaginary" (non-physical) part. Thus light and mass are two different forms of energy. Just as Kabbalah speaks of the right pillar being the pillar of force (directed energy) and the left pillar that of form (static energy, or energy "at rest").

The analogy here is a sphere moving through a plane. The 2d inhabitant of the plane would see a dot appear on the horizon that would increase in size until it reached its maximum extent and then shrink to a point and dissapear. How did that happen, the 2d being might ask? And is very unlikely to come up with the idea that a 3d object was moving through 2d &mdash; because he would have no idea of the existence of 3d (being a 2d being), nor, if he did stumble across the idea, would anyone take him seriously, having had no experience of a 3d object (to the best of their knowledge) and thus would be loathe to accept an explanation that included objects from a higher dimension. It would require for them to believe that such a thing as a dimension existed. As well as that of a higher one.

</div>

R' K: **As long as...**

**הבאים** _We are coming_ {Weak argument!}

n6] **Generation** maintained spiritual level: Patriarchs

n8-14] Steps to **enslavement**

1. Labour tax
2. "Abort" male babies
3. Throw male babies into the river (children?)
4. Search & seizure

n9] **Outsiders** Take advantage of the newcomers
\*n12] Levites NOT enslaved? Why?
n13] **ויקצוּ** The newcomers now _disgusted_ them.

n15-22] **Infanticide**

- Shifrah & Puah, which some claim are Jochebed & Miriam, Moses' mother and sister (Sotah 11b).
- Why different names?
  The justification for this infanticide seems to have been based on a prophecy that the saviour of the people was going to be born in this generation (Sotah 12b).
  n21] "G-d rewarded them with houses". Some say they were not literally houses, but dynasties that their bloodline would produce. {However, it is far more likely, under such autocratic rule, that they would have been arrested and possibly executed for not carrying out the pharaoh's wishes. The polar "you are either with us, or you are against us". }
  n22] **לכּל־עמי**: The pharaoh's edict included all the people! How could that be?

## Chapter 2

n1-10] **Moses**
n1] Jochebed was 130 years old when she gave birth to Moses?
*n4] **Know**: Example of G-d's drawing the "outline" and we "enact"/live the details!
*n5] Nothing is impossible

n10] **Name - Monios**

- The princes gave him the name Monios, which was translated to Moshe in Hebrew.
- There is an interesting comparison here between Moses and Buddha. They both were raised as princes. They left when they were still young. They both were absent before the emerged onto the scene, and changed their worlds. Buddha spent 40 years under the Bodhi tree, but before that he might have spent 20 years exploring the various paths available to him. Moses fled to Midian (some think he might actually have spent most of that time in Africa), and was gone for 60 years before returning to save his people.
  n12] She used his **name**
- As he was three months old when Jochebed placed him in the river, he would already have had a name. This is a name we never learn. But, here, we learn from Jochebed, that he had a name, for she used it...

n15] **Fled** He was 20 (or was he 12)? He return at 80.
n16] **Minister** Reuel &ndash; who is either Jethro, or else is the son of Jethro)
n18] Jethro has 7 names (4:18)

n22] **גרשֹׁם** Gershon - **גר שׁם**, _lives there_, stranger in a strange land.
n23-25] **210 years**: That is the time of our people were in Egypt. We lived there for 116 years before the oppression, and then another 86 prior to our exodus.

## Chapter 3

n1-10] **Integrity** {It was a time when people had respect for one another that they knew that societies were built on the foundation of honouring the other's space. Today we have laws that are enacted to ensure that, though they need to be fortified by fences. }

n2-5] Moses' first **prophecy**

First he notices the fire in the thorn bush that is not being consumed, then the angel calls to him. Only then does G-d talk to him. The reasoning here is that G-d did not want to overwhelm him, as this was their first interaction, so He introduced Himself by stages.
n4] **הננִ**&mdash;_I am here_. As in "I am present."
{It is said that if one could be fully present for one moment in one's life, it would be a life-changing event.}
n5] **אַל־תִקְרַב הֵלֹם**&mdash;_Do not come closer_. This is hallowed ground, for the mountain is holy. It is the mountain on which the revelation will take place.
**שׁל־נעליך מעל רגליך**&mdash;Remove your shoes. {To connect unobstructed with the Divine Presence.} \* Unimpeded: ground (R' Hirsch).
*n7] **כי ידעתי**
n8] **ואֵרד**
**טובה ורחבה** Should be 7 nations, but the Gilgashites fled.
n9] **ועתה** : Now is the time
**הלחץ** : ghetto. Separated from the Egyptians. Little fraternization.
n10] **Hero Story** One man prevails *alone* against a formidable empire.
n11-17] **Doubts** Moses expresses his doubts about his capability to carry out the task that G-d has set before him.
n11] Not quite true (according to narrative).
Surge forward to Torah.
n12] **Rewarded**. We are reward according to our potential.
*n13] **שׁמ המפורשׁ**&mdash;**The Ineffable Name**
\*n14] **אהֵיה אשׁר אהיה**&mdash;**I will be what I will be**. Timeless & eternal.\
\*n15] **HaShem**
**זה־שׁמי לעלם** - that is the name with which I am concealed
n16] **Message**
n18] **פקֹד פקדתי**
n18-22] **Mislead** Pharaoh
n19] **ולא ביד חזקה** : Relent

## Chapter 4

\*n1-17] **Moses doubts** the people
n10] **In me**
**לא אישׁ דברים**
n14] **ושׁמח בלבו** : Aaron was truly happy regarding Moses.
n17] **ואת הנטֵה הזה** : His magic staff
n20] **Donkey**
n23] **בִנךָ בכרךָ**_The firstborn_.

n24-26] Zipporah and the circumcision
n26] circumcision
