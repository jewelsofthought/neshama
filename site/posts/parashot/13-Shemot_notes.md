### n1-7] Jacob's son's merits

Even after selling Joseph and lying to their father, they rose to become spiritually pure! No punishment, no repercussions or redemption, pure enough to prevent enslavement of our people.

The grandchildren were not regarded as spiritually pure, which speaks of the incredibly swift descent of moral integrity. Yet it occurs one step at time. Just as a spiritual ascension is a relatively slow and tedious process, so is the descent.

### Likened to the stars

He counts them, "come out" and "gathered in". Here is the concept of stars as emissaries of G-d, who knows each one's "name".

Today we distance ourselves from the stars. They no longer play any significant part in our lives, as we have excluded them and any influence they might have on our cosmos beyond what says tells us.

### n12] Constellations

**Q**: Is this a foreign influence?{.note}

Example of Judaism using "science" to elucidate the text.

### Evolution

Evolution is not incorrect. Rather call it a progression, a sequence of events, one dependent on the previous, emerging step by step. In order to be a body, there needs to be cells; cells need certain nutrients, molecules from atoms, built up from sub-atomic energies. All this had to built from the bottom up. The first stage needs to be completed before the second stage can manifest, the second stage needs to be completed before the third stage, etc. And the successful evolutionary steps will continue, barring "unexpected" events.
