G-d speaks through nature, known as _Shechinah_, the Divine Presence. Not G-d, but G-d's Words. That is why we are spiritually uplifted by being in nature, and often have deep revelations in a quiet spot in natural surroundings &mdash; if we allow ourselves to receive.

Biblically, it is a battle between man-made matter versus natural matter. That is why we are commanded to rise up and destroy the idol-worshippers &mdash; which one could interpret as those they worship the material above the non-material. We cannot escape from this, like the Exodus tale, however, we need to create, fashion and/or occupy Holy Land, land that has been blessed by G-d.

In this place that we occupy, we have to remove the idol-worshippers. This process begins in our minds, and then we can begin to build the land we can live on.

On this land, there can only be truth. Do you know what truth? And if you found this truth, would you be willing to give your life to hold on to this truth that has become your guiding light? Will you recognise those who speak the truth, and will you follow them?

What is the truth, you may ask? I say &mdash; if you've encountered it,  if you have experienced it, you know it, and will be able to recognise it wherever it appears.
