## Laws of human contamination

We have proceeded from the laws of contamination טוּמא of dead animals, to the laws of contamination טוּמה from human beings, starting with the birth of the child, where it all begins. (_Ibn Ezra_ to v. 2) [**NOTE**: be-in(g) - be-(g)-in]{.note}

## Childbirth and purification

> The creation of life is the most sublime phenomenon in the universe. However, the mere fact of life is not enough. It must be a tool for the service of G-d; otherwise it is nothing. The mere absence of contamination is not yet the fulfilment of man's goal. Human aspiration must rise higher than the elimination of the negative; it must strive for positive achievement.

> One is not completely cleansed until one has come to the resting place of God's Presence with an offering that represents atonement for the past,and dedication to the future.

## Childbirth

> Nowadays, it is customary that as soon as a new mother feels well enough to leave home, she goes to the synagogue and hears _Kedusha_, or a similar part of the service. It is also customary after the forty or eighty days when she would bring her offering, her husband is called to the Torah, as a symbolic representation of the offering described in this chapter.

12:1]  

- Male : 40 days
  - 7d [תָמְאָה]{dir="rtl"} -> same as [נִדָב]{dir="rtl} => [כימי נדת דוֹתה תִמאה]{dir="rtl"}
  - 33d בדמי טהרה - blood of purity =>
    - not to touch anything sacred;
    - not to enter the temple [מקדשׁ]{dir="rtl"}
    - 8th day circumcision: [ימול בשׂר ערלתו]{dir="rtl"}

- Female: 80 days
  - 2w +
  - 66d

Perhaps there was the feminine sacred which the women carried, that men <span style="text-decoration: underline">never</span> touch!

Two offerings, a sin offering ([חטאה]{dir="rtl"}) and an elevation offering ([לעולה]{dir="rtl"}).

<p class="note">
{NOTE: [חט־א־ה]{dir="rtl"} - Sin passes through [א]{dir="rtl"} which is the point of transformation, the zero point, to re-emerge through the breath of life, the [ה]{dir="rtl"}. Perhaps modern Hebrew numberology should begin with [א]{dir="rtl"} being the number 0, and [ב]{dir="rtl"} being the number 1 (not necessarily the 1st!) For the beginning [ב]{dir="rtl"}, is actually the beginning of the narrative. As without 2, there can be no story, there are no interactions when there is only one.}
</p>

There are offerings for the child, for what the child may become. We have the two paths stretching before us till the end of our lives. The path of sin and the path of elevation.

_These offerings and rituals symbolise that birth inaugurates the beginnings of_... the child's life. The hope is that he will dedicate himself to a life of holiness that will enable G-d to say to the child and his parents, "You fulfil the purpose of the entire work of Creation.

And not to have to punish him for having chosen the path of sin. In the hope of cleansing him of any sins that he might have brought with him into this world, we offer the sin offering. For the privilege of raising the child to a life of dedication and holiness, the elevation offering is offered.

## <i>Tzaria</i>

The unknown affliction. What if it was a bacteria that has since dissappeared? The only contradiction would be when someone turned completely white, they would be looked at as pure, and could only be contaminated if healthy skin appeared.

That would still leave us with the conclusion that today it would still be interpreted as a spiritual blemish. Perhaps if we acknowledge the connection between the physical and the mental/spiritual, there would be less debate in this area. If one accepted that bacteria exist, and only become bothersome when the conditions for the sprouting arise. In that case, one could make a good argument for it being a behaviour that is causing this problem to occur. For instance, speaking evil of others.

The rabbi's say: The pattern that emerges is that tit is a DIvine retribution for the offender's failure to feel the needs and share the hurt of others. G-d rebukes this anti-social behaviour by isolating him from society, so that he can experience the pain he has imposed on others&mdash; and heal himself though repentance.

The mark was to appear on his skin, or literally on the skin of his meat [שׁעור־בשׂרו]{dir="rtl"} (which does not make much sense actually!)

<p class="note">
{NOTE: Adam had a skin of light [אור]{dir="rtl"}. Now we, his descendants from his fall, have skins [עור]{dir="rtl"}, covering our nakedness. The above could also be translated as his "meat-skin"}
