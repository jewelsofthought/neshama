## Chapter 1

n1-3] 1st census

Time moves on. We are now in the first day of the Second Month, in the second year of the Exodus from Egypt when G-d commands Moses to take a census of all the children of Israel. A head cound of every male "according to the number of their names "[בְּמִסְפַּ֣ר שֵׁמ֔וֹת] from twenty years up. Any you will count them by the legion. {dir|"rtl"}.

n5-15] Names of head's of "father's" house.

**N**: They are not mentioned as the "heads of the houses/tribes of Israel", instead they are the heads of their "father's" house. It is a nice reminder that it is not your fiefdom, but rather a gift.

| בֵית־אֲבֹתָ֖יו | Father | רֹ֥אשׁ | Head |  בֶּן־ | Son of |
|--- | --- | --- | ---| --- |--- |
| לרוּבֵ֕ן| Reuben | אֱלִיצ֖וּר|  Elitzur | בֶּן־שְׁדֵיאֽוּר| Shedeur |
| ולְשִׁמְע֕וֹן| Simeon | שְׁלֻֽמִיאֵ֖ל|  Shelumiel  |בֶּן־צוּרִֽישַׁדָּֽי  | Zurishaddai |
| זלִֽיהוּדָ֕ה| Judah | נַחְשׁ֖וֹן| Nahshon |בֶּן־עַמִּֽינָדָֽב | Amminadab|
| לְיִ֨שָּׂשכָ֔ר| Issachar | נְתַנְאֵ֖ל| Nethanel | בֶּן־צוּעָֽר| Zu'ar|
|לִזְבוּלֻ֕ן | Zebulun | אֱלִיאָ֖ב| Eliab | בֶּן־חֵלֹֽן| Helon|

| לְאֶפְרַ֕יִם| Ephraim| אֱלִֽישָׁמָ֖ע|Elishama' | בֶּן־עַמִּיה֑וּד| 'Ammihud|
|לִמְנַשֶּׁ֕ה | Manasseh |גַּמְלִיאֵ֖ל | Gamliel |בֶּן־פְּדָהצֽוּר | Pedazur|
|לְבִ֨נְיָמִ֔ן | Benjamin |אֲבִידָ֖ן | Abidan | בֶּן־גִּדְעֹנִֽי| Gideoni|
| לְדָ֕ן|Dan |אֲחִיעֶ֖זֶר | Ahi'ezer |בֶּן־עַמִּֽישַׁדָּֽי | 'Ammishaddai|
|לְאָשֵׁ֕ר | Asher | פַּגְעִיאֵ֖ל| Pag'iel | בֶּן־עָכְרָֽן| 'Ochran|
| לְגָ֕ד| Gad |אֶלְיָסָ֖ף | Eliasaph | בֶּן־דְּעוּאֵֽל| De'uel|
|לְנַ֨פְתָּלִ֔י | Naphtali |אֲחִירַ֖ע | Ahira' |בֶּן־עֵינָֽן | 'Enan|

Then it says: "These were the ones summoned by the congregation" &mdash; implying that these people were the acknowledged princes of the tribes. They were also the "heads of the thousands of Israel". It seems that the tribes or congregation itself was organised in thousands, with a head of each thousand [v16].

The way the census occurred, is they assembled, and "declared their pedigrees" [v18]. In some of the men's work that I participated in, their was a naming ceremony, in which you declared your pedigree: Yehuda ben Aaron ben Hillel - Yehuda, son of Aaron, son of Hillel.

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
יח. וְאֵ֨ת כָּל־הָֽעֵדָ֜ה הִקְהִ֗ילוּ בְּאֶחָד֙ לַחֹ֣דֶשׁ הַשֵּׁנִ֔י וַיִּתְיַֽלְד֥וּ עַל־מִשְׁפְּחֹתָ֖ם לְבֵ֣ית אֲבֹתָ֑ם בְּמִסְפַּ֣ר שֵׁמ֗וֹת מִבֶּ֨ן עֶשְׂרִ֥ים שָׁנָ֛ה וָמַ֖עְלָה לְגֻלְגְּלֹתָֽם:
</p>
  <p>
18. and they assembled all the congregation on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees according to their families according to their fathers' houses; according to the number of names, a head count of every male from twenty years old and upward.

  </p>
</blockquote>

**N**: n1:18] [וַיִּתְיַֽלְדוּ עַל־מִשְׁפְּחֹתָם]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _and they declared their pedigrees_. [יִּתְיַֽלְדוּ]{dir="rtl"} in modern Hebrew now means "to behave childishly". Whereas in biblical times it was a "recalling/remembering" of your ancestry &mdash; from whence you come.{.note}

**Q**: Did each male (of fighting age) declare their pedigree, or just the leaders mentioned here? It seems that it would have been an overwhelming task and a long one too, had each one come forward and declared their pedigree.{.note}

v1:20-46]

Now there is a repeat or summary of the men that have been counted. It is like a litany, repeated for each of the tribes (barring the Levite) with only the names and amounts differing.

The first one is slightly different as an introduction, however all the rest follow the same chant:

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
כב. לִבְנֵ֣י _____ תּֽוֹלְדֹתָ֥ם לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתָ֖ם לְבֵ֣ית אֲבֹתָ֑ם פְּקֻדָ֗יו בְּמִסְפַּ֤ר שֵׁמוֹת֙ לְגֻלְגְּלֹתָ֔ם כָּל־זָכָ֗ר מִבֶּ֨ן עֶשְׂרִ֤ים שָׁנָה֙ וָמַ֔עְלָה כֹּ֖ל יֹצֵ֥א צָבָֽא:
כג. פְּקֻֽדֵיהֶ֖ם לְמַטֵּ֣ה ______ __________________.
</p>
  <p>
22 Of the tribe of ______, their descendants according to their families, according to their fathers' houses; his tally, according to the number of individual names of every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were fit to go out to the army.
23 Those counted from the tribe of ______: ______________________.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Q**: If G-d was interested in every Jew, then why are the numbers "rounded" off to the 100's (except for one time there being a 50)? My answer would be that the smallest "unit" was a group of 10 men...{.note}

v48-54] Levites to serve the _Mishkan_

The tribe of Levi was not numbered ([לֹ֣א תִפְקֹ֔ד]{dir="rtl"}), but appointed "over the Tabernacle of Testimony ([מִשְׁכַּ֨ן הָֽעֵדֻ֜ת]{dir="rtl"}); they shall carry it and they serve it ([יְשָֽׁרְתֻ֑הוּ]{dir="rtl"}) and they shall encamp around it.[v50] They shall dismantle it, and erect it. No outsider may approach it on the pain of death ([ וְהַזָּ֥ר הַקָּרֵ֖ב יוּמָֽת]{dir="rtl"}).[v51]

n54] [וְשָֽׁמְרוּ֙ הַֽלְוִיִּ֔ם אֶת־מִשְׁמֶ֖רֶת מִשְׁכַּ֥ן הָֽעֵדֽוּת]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _and the Levites shall keep the charge of the Mishkan of the Testimony._ This is the task that the Levites were assigned.

## Chapter 2

v1-34] Camp details

Now the placement of the camps are detailed. However, once again it is a type of a litany, that, in fact, repeats information that we have already covered &mdash; namely, the names of the princes and their parentage, as well as the number of members (children) of the tribe.

v2:2] First, the setting:

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ב. אִ֣ישׁ עַל־דִּגְל֤וֹ בְאֹתֹת֙ לְבֵ֣ית אֲבֹתָ֔ם יַֽחֲנ֖וּ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל מִנֶּ֕גֶד סָבִ֥יב לְאֹֽהֶל־מוֹעֵ֖ד יַֽחֲנֽוּ:
</p>
  <p>
2 The children of Israel shall encamp each man by his division with the flag staffs of their fathers' house; some distance from the Tent of Meeting they shall encamp.
  </p>
</blockquote>

I am just going to write down the new details, with the litany.

First those camping to the East:
Judah -> Issachar -> Zebulun
Total: 186,400 - they journey first

South:
Reuben ->  Simeon -> Gad
Total: 151,450 - the set out second

Center:
The Tent of Meeting ([אֹֽהֶל־מוֹעֵ֛ד]{dir="rtl"}) surrounded by the Levite camp [v17].

n2:17] [כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֤ר יַֽחֲנוּ֙ כֵּ֣ן יִסָּ֔עוּ אִ֥ישׁ עַל־יָד֖וֹ לְדִגְלֵיהֶֽם]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _Just as they camp, so shall they travel, each man in his place, by their divisions_.

West:
Ephriam -> Manasseh -> Benjamin
Total: 108,100 - set out third

North:
Dan -> Asher -> Naftali
Total: 157,600 -set out last

**N**: This creates order, but also a definite hierarchy. [I need to check if the order of placement and leaving is by age - or some other criterion.] It places the priests - the descendants from Aaron - at the head. The Levites lower - they may not perform sacrifices or ceremonies, but they serve the Divine Presence by caring for His Temple.

## Chapter 3

v3:1- ] The Kohanim

Having dealt with the tribes, and the care of the _Mishkan_, G-d now turns his attention on the Priests who will attend to the ceremonies required.

n3:1-3] [וְאֵ֛לֶּה תּֽוֹלְדֹ֥ת אַֽהֲרֹ֖ן וּמשֶׁ֑ה]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _These are the descendants of Aaron and Moses_

**N**: However only the descendants of Aaron are mentioned!{.note}

v3:2-3]

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ב. וְאֵ֛לֶּה שְׁמ֥וֹת בְּנֵי־אַֽהֲרֹ֖ן הַבְּכֹ֣ר | נָדָ֑ב וַֽאֲבִיה֕וּא אֶלְעָזָ֖ר וְאִֽיתָמָֽר:
ג. אֵ֗לֶּה שְׁמוֹת֙ בְּנֵ֣י אַֽהֲרֹ֔ן הַכֹּֽהֲנִ֖ים הַמְּשֻׁחִ֑ים אֲשֶׁר־מִלֵּ֥א יָדָ֖ם לְכַהֵֽן:
</p>
  <p>
2 These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
3 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed kohanim, whom he consecrated to serve as kohanim.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**N**: This could be paraphrased as "These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, the anointed kohanim, whom he consecrated to serve as kohanim.{.note}

**Q**: So we have a question. Why repeat it this way? Secondly, why are Nadab and Abihu mentioned, when we know they already died?{.note}

n3:4] [אֵ֨שׁ זָרָ֜ה]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _Alien fire_. Here we encounter this term as a further clue as to what the fire was that they brought to the Lord.

Now the tribe of Levi is brought to Aaron, the kohen, that they may serve him [v6].

v7]

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ז. וְשָׁמְר֣וּ אֶת־מִשְׁמַרְתּ֗וֹ וְאֶת־מִשְׁמֶ֨רֶת֙ כָּל־הָ֣עֵדָ֔ה לִפְנֵ֖י אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֑ד לַֽעֲבֹ֖ד אֶת־עֲבֹדַ֥ת הַמִּשְׁכָּֽן:
</p>
  <p>
7 They shall keep his charge and the charge of the entire community before the Tent of Meeting, to perform the service of the Mishkan.
  </p>
</blockquote>

They will be in charge of the service, and all the vessels while Aaron and his sons will keep their kehunah ([כְּהֻנָּתָ֑ם]{dir="rtl"}).

v12-13] First-born

Then, as we know, G-d took the Levites in place of the firstborns &mdash; whom he had sanctified for himself.

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
יג. כִּ֣י לִי֘ כָּל־בְּכוֹר֒ בְּיוֹם֩ הַכֹּתִ֨י כָל־בְּכ֜וֹר בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֗יִם הִקְדַּ֨שְׁתִּי לִ֤י כָל־בְּכוֹר֙ בְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל מֵֽאָדָ֖ם עַד־בְּהֵמָ֑ה לִ֥י יִֽהְי֖וּ אֲנִ֥י יְהוָֹֽה:
</p>
  <p>
13 For all the firstborns are Mine; since the day I smote all the firstborns in the land of Egypt, I sanctified for Myself all the firstborns of Israel, both man and beast they shall become Mine, I am the Lord.
  </p>
</blockquote>

n3:14-22] [פְּקֹד֙ אֶת־בְּנֵ֣י לֵוִ֔י]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _Count the children of Levi_, from one month up.

names of Levi's sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
names of:

the sons of ______ according to their families were _________.

Gershon | Libni and Shim'ei |
Kohath | Amram, Itzhar, Hebron, and Uziel |
Merari | Mahli and Mushi |

Now comes a more complex litany:

For ______**, the ______ family and the ______ family; these are the ____ families. Their sum was made according to the number of males from the age of one month and upward; the tally amounted to**_________. The Gershonite families shall camp _____________. The prince of the father's house of the ______ is ______ the son of ______. The charge of the sons of ______ in the Tent of Meeting ___________________ ...

v3:23-26] Gershon - 7,500 - West, behind.
For Gershon, the Libnite family and the Shim'eite family; these are the Gershonite families.
Their sum was made according to the number of males from the age of one month and upward; the tally amounted to seven thousand, five hundred.
The Gershonite families shall camp behind the Mishkan, to the west.
The prince of the father's house of the Gershonites is Eliasaph the son of Lael.
The charge of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting [included] the Mishkan, the Tent, its cover, and the screen for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
The hangings of the courtyard, the screen at the entrance to the courtyard, which is around the Mishkan and the altar, its ropes, as well as all the work involved.

v3:27-31] Kohath - 8,600 - South, side
For Kohath, the Amramite family, the Izharite family, the Hebronite family, and the Uzielite family; these are the families of Kohath.
The number of all males from the age of one month and upward amounted to eight thousand six hundred, the keepers of the charge of the holy.
The families of the sons of Kohath shall camp to the south side of the Mishkan.
The prince of the father's house of the Kohathite families is Elizaphan the son of Uziel.
Their charge [included] the ark, the table, the menorah, the altars, and the holy utensils with which they would minister, and the screen and all the work involved.

v3:32] Eleazar
The prince over all the princes of the Levites shall be Eleazar the son of Aaron the kohen, the appointment of all the keepers of the charge of the Holy.

v3:33-37] Merari - 6,200 - North
For Merari, the Machlite family and the Mushite family; these are the families of Merari.
Their tally according to the number of males from the age of one month and upward was six thousand two hundred.
The prince of the father's house of the Merarite families is Zuriel the son of Abihail; they shall camp on the north side of the Mishkan.
The appointment of the charge of the sons of Merari [included] the planks of the Mishkan, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets, all its utensils, and all the work involved. Also the pillars of the surrounding courtyard, their sockets, their stakes, and their ropes.

Camping in front of the Mishkan, in front of the Tent of Meeting to the east were Moses, Aaron and his sons, the keepers of the charge of the Sanctuary as a trust for the children of Israel [v38].

22,000 Levites [v39]

v3:40-] Count firstborn males

v3:40] All males

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
מ. וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָֹ֜ה אֶל־משֶׁ֗ה פְּקֹ֨ד כָּל־בְּכֹ֤ר זָכָר֙ לִבְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל מִבֶּן־חֹ֖דֶשׁ וָמָ֑עְלָה וְשָׂ֕א אֵ֖ת מִסְפַּ֥ר שְׁמֹתָֽם:
</p>
  <p>
40 The Lord said to Moses: Count every firstborn male aged one month and upward of the children of Israel, and take the number of their names.
  </p>
</blockquote>

v3:41] Levites instead of firstborn
<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
41 And you shall take the Levites for Me I am the Lord instead of all firstborns among the children of Israel. And [take] the Levites' animals instead of all the firstborn animals of the children of Israel.

  <p>
41 And you shall take the Levites for Me I am the Lord instead of all firstborns among the children of Israel. And [take] the Levites' animals instead of all the firstborn animals of the children of Israel.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Moses did as he was told [v42], and the total was 22,273. These 273 "excess souls" required redemption [v46] at 5 shekels (of the Holy shekel). 1 shekel = 20 gerahs.

v3:46-47] Excess souls

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
מו. וְאֵת֙ פְּדוּיֵ֣י הַשְּׁלשָׁ֔ה וְהַשִּׁבְעִ֖ים וְהַמָּאתָ֑יִם הָעֹֽדְפִים֙ עַל־הַֽלְוִיִּ֔ם מִבְּכ֖וֹר בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל:

</p>
  <p>
46 As for the two hundred and seventy three of the children of Israel who required redemption, who are in excess of the Levites, you shall take five shekels per head, according to the holy shekel, by which the shekel is twenty gerahs.
  </p>
</blockquote>

This money, 1,364 shekels, was redeemed by Aaron and his sons [v51].

## Chapter 4

v4:1-3] Count Kohath

Now we count the sons of Kohath,[v2]
from 30-50, which is all those that still do service in the Tent of Meeting ([אֹ֥הֶל מוֹעֵֽד]{dir="rtl"}) [v3] &mdash; the Holy of Holies ([קֹ֖דֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִֽׁים]{dir="rtl"}) [v4].

v4:4-20] Tent of Meeting service

  <p>
4 The following is the service of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting-the Holy of Holies.
  </p>
</blockquote>

v4:5-15] Aaron and his sons cover up the ark and its utensils, when  the camp is about to travel.

v4:20] Final word:

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
כ. וְלֹֽא־יָבֹ֧אוּ לִרְא֛וֹת כְּבַלַּ֥ע אֶת־הַקֹּ֖דֶשׁ וָמֵֽתוּ:
