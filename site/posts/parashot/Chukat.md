<h5> 19] The Red Cow פרה אדומה</h5>

The law of the Red Cow is described as the quintessential (חקת התֹרַה) <em>decree of the Torah</em> meaning that it is beyond human understanding. Because Satan and the nations taunt Israel, saying, "What is the purpose of this commandment?" the Torah statest that it is a decree of the One Who gave the Torah, and it is not for anyone to question it (<em>Rashi</em>). <em>Ramban</em> explains that this particular commandment invites the taunts of the heretics because it is performed outside the Temple, as if to propitiate the "demons" of the field. <em>Tosafot</em> (<em>Avodah Zarah</em> 35a) state that one should not try to explain this precept because G-d gave us His best and most secret commands in the form of a "Divine Kiss", as it were, like the intimacy of a lover to his beloved.

It is axiomatic, however, that since all laws of the Torah are the product of G-d's intelligence, any human inability to comprehend them indicates the limitation of the student, not the Teacher.

The underlying message is that the Supreme Intelligence has granted man a huge treasury of spiritual and intellectual gifts, but none is more precious that the knowledge that G-d is infinite, both in existence and in wisdom, while man is as limited in his ability to comprehend as he is in his physical existence. An essential component of wisdom is the knowledge that man's failure to understand truth does not make it untrue. (abridged from <em>R. Munk: The Call of the Torah</em>).

> However, even though we may be unable to understand this "eternal decree" (לחקת עולם), as there is no longer any red cows, this decree can and is no longer active&mdash;though we relate to it as though it is still present. This is part of the cognitive dissonance that is most apparent at this time.

> Seeking a deeper relevance to this decree, it must fall into the category of "certain things that stem from the mind of God are beyond our ken", and this is a good example of that. For one of the most insidious tools of Satan is to instill us with arrogance, believing that wer can unravel all the secrets of the universe.

n19:7] המחשׁה refers to the Tabernacle Courtyard, which is as the camp of the _Shechina_, or the Divine Presence.

n19:9] The ashes are divided into 3 parts:

1. For future use
2. For the 24 divisions of Kohanim...
   <em>Who are what are the 24 divisions of Kohanim?</em>
3. Kept in the <em>Chail</em> for safekeeping.

n19:13] If an unclean person enters the courtyard, he will receive the punishment of _karet_, and be cut of from his people.

n19:14] Contamination spreads under a "tent" or any sort of cover. The roof over the corpse has the effect of spreading the contamination under the entire air space that it covers. Thus, if a dead body is in one room of a house or under part of a tree, any person or vessel anywhere in the house or under another part of the tree's shelter becomes contaminated.

> It is as if the corpse becomes a potential conduit for the demonic realms to enter.

n19:15] An eathenware vessel can become contaminated only if a contaminated substance comes into its _interior_ (_Leviticus_ 11:33). The same principle applies if the vessel were under a roof, for in that case the contaminated air space is in the interior of the vessel. But if it has a cover seal onto it, thus insulating its interior, it cannot become contaminated. However, wood or metal vessels would become contaminated whether or not they were covered, because they can be contaminated from the outside (_Rashi_; _Sifre_)

n19:16] In an open field, one can only become contaminated through touching a corpse.

n19-20]If the tent is made of materials that can be defiled, it must be purified. Buildings that are anchored to the ground, cannot become contaminated, however.

<h5> 20] Miriam Dies</h5>

n20] A new era was now beginning. Nearly 38 years had passed since the narrative in the previous chapter.

n20:1-2] <strong>Miriam's death and the lack of water</strong>
From the fact that there was no water after she died, we see that it was in her merit that the miraculous well followed the people throughout their wanderings and provided a plentiful supply of fresh water.

> I wonder about this "well" that followed us in the desert. Did it give water constantly? Did it only give water when we stopped? Did the "rock" that gave well need to be carried, or did it move on its own?
> I suppose I would imagine that once it was connected to the earth, it would give water, and not when it was in motion.

n20:3-5] <strong>The people protest</strong>

G-d is indulgent of people who have a legitimate complain even when they voice it more provocatively than they should (_Or HaChaim_).

n20:9] <strong> ויקח משׁה אה המטה מלפני יהוה &mdash</strong> _Moses takes the staff_

Moses takes the staff from its place in the Holy of Holies, before the Holy Ark (_Ibn Ezra_). n20:708] This is the same staff that he had used to perform the miracles in Egypt, and which he had used to provide water for the people after they crossed the Sea of reeds.

n20:8] <strong>השׁלג The Rock</strong>
The definite article _the_ indicates that this was a known rock... This same rock accompanied the people throughout their wanderings as long as Miriam was alive. After her death, it ceased to yield water, and was hidden.

n20:11] <strong>ויך את־הסלע במטהו פעמים </strong>&mdash; _And struck the rock with his staff twice_

G-d had commanded Moses to _speak_ to the rock that had given water before, but he could not find it. He spoke to a different rock, but nothing happend. [Moses reasoned that if he had found the proper rock, speaking would have sufficed. But since he could not find that rock, he thought he would have to _strike_ a different one, following the precedent of _Exodus_, when he performed the miracle by striking the stone; otherwise, he reasoned, why had G-d commanded him to take the staff with him? (_Beer Mayim Chaim_] He struck the rock, but since only a trickle of water emerged, so he struck it again, whereupon a torrent began to flow (_Rashi_). Apparently, Moses should have spoken to rock after rock until he came upon the right one, but the people's intemperance provoked him to anger. (see _Rashi_ to 31:21).

n20:13] <strong>Moses' sin</strong>

e) _Chiddushei HaRim_ finds the key to the shortcomings of Moses and Aaron in the word לעיניהם, _before their eyes_ (v.8), implying that Moses had to speak to the rock in such a way that the people would see something, rather than merely know it. Similarly, at the transcendental Revelation at Sinai, the Sages say that the nation _saw_ what is normally only _heard_ (see _Exodus_ 20:15), meaning that their understanding of that experience went beyond the normal limitations of human physicality. Here too, G-d wanted Israel to _see_ &ndash; that G-d provides people with whatever they need to carry out His bidding. If they could achieve that perception, the barriers to belief would fall aways and the nation could rise to new heights.

> It is more like a wand. It definitely contains some magical properties.

20:14] Edom refuses us passage

20:22] At Mt. Hor, Aaron "will not enter the land", dies.
20:26] Strip him of his vestments.

> I wondered how come Aaron was in his vestments upon ascending the mountain. Would he not change or divest himself of them before beginning such a journey? Did he wear them continuously, or was this a special occasion.

_Ramban_ surmises that after Aaron performed the final Tabernacle service of the afternoon he was still clad in the vestemenst of the _Kohen Gadol_, Moses summoned him to the mountain... [n20:26]

<h5>n22-29] Aaron's death</h5>

On the first of Av, in the fortieth year of Israel's wondering in the Wilderness, at the age of one hundred and twenty-three years(33:39-40) Aaron died.

Aaron died through מיתת נשׁיקה, <em>death by a kiss of</em> G-d, as it were, meaning that his soul became united with the holiness of the _Shechinah_ [the Divine Presence]. The Talmud describes this as the most exalted form of death, likening it to pulling a hair from mild, meaning that the soul leaves the body without resistance. _R' Gedaliah Schorr_ explains that to the extent that people sin in life and establish a bond between their souls and the pleasures of this world, it becomes difficult for them to part from physical life. For those who become totally attached to physicality, the Sages like death to pulling embedded thistles from sheep's wool. (see _Resisai Laylah_ 56)

> I have difficulty with the ascetic detachment expressed here. I believe that we need to establish a bond between our souls and this world - though not necessarily the pleasures of this world exclusively. If we try and seduce the soul into abandoning its goal, and not obeying the will of G-d, but make them instead subservient to our own wills, or the need to fulfil their desires, we have indeed fallen into sin. But if we dedicate our lives and the bond of the soul with this world - to which we have been sent - to G-d, then we are fulfilling our purpose and His Will.

20:29] The nation wept for 30 days.

> The note here is that the nation did not weep after Miriam's death

21:1] Canaanite king of Arad took a captive.

> How strange. They took a single captive - that was enough for them to make a vow. I wonder who the captive was. Although according to _Rashi_, it must have been a female slave. Even more so, why would a female slave's capture be mentioned. Why was it of any importance to Israel?

21:2] "Israel" made a vow.

> Here the nation is referred to as Israel - which has not happened often. I suppose it is because they spoke with one voice, making as one a vow to HaShem. They did indeed consecrate them and their cities. However, they were referred to as It, and "It consecrated them"... Who is It?

21:4] Mt. Hor -> Sea of Reeds

21:5] Complain: insubstantial food
n21:6] <strong>הנחשׁים השׂריפים &mdash;</strong> _Fiery serpents_;
The poison in their fangs made their victims feel as if they were burning.

n21:7] Once a natural force has been unleashed, special merit is needto to remove it, or protect against it, even if the sin that caused it has been removed (_Or HaChaim_).

n21:8] (_Rosh Hashanah_ 29a) "Does a serpent cause death or life? Rather, when they looked upward and subjected their hearts to their Father in Heaven, they were healed, but if not, they died. (_Rashi_)

n21:9] G-d had not specified what material Moses was to fashion the serpent, but he chose נחושׁת, _copper_, because it contains the letters of נחשׁ, the _serpent_ that was attacking the sinners (_Rashi_). It was a miracle within a miracle; the source of the destruction was also the source of healing (_Ramban_).

21:10] Encamped at Oboth -> encamped in the ruins of the passes in the wilderness facing Moab towards the rising sun-> encamped in the valley of Zered -> encamped on the other side of Amon - which is in the wilderness that juts out from the border of the Amorite.

21:14] It is said in the _Book or Wars of Hashem_:
"The gift of [the Sea of] Reeds and the rivers of Amon;
the outpouring of the rivers when it veered to dwell at Ar, and leaned against the border of Moab.

n21:15] <strong>ואשׁר הנחלים &mdash;</strong>_The outpouring of the rivers_. Rivers of blood signaled to Israel that G-d had performed a monumental miracle on their behalf. The Amorites had planned to ambush the Israelites as they passed through a deep gorge near the Moabite border. They had hidden in caves over a narrow pass, ready to push huge boulders down upon the Jews as they passed through helplessly. Miraculously the cliffs that formed the walls of the gorge moved together with stone outcroppings moving into the caves and crushing the hidden Amorites. All of this was unknown to the Israelites until they saw blood flowing down the gorge.

<strong>אשׁר נטה &mdash;</strong> _When it veered..._ The northern Amorite cliff moved southward toward Ar, until it "leaned" against it, crushing those waiting in ambush.

21:21] -> Sihon, king of the Amorite did not permit them to pass; arrived at Jahaz and waged war against Israel. Israel took possession of his lands, from Arnon to Jabbok to the children of Ammon. Israel settled in Amorite cities; in Heshbon, city of Sihon.

n21:27] המושׁלים &mdash; _The poets_

> The ones who complete or fulfil the story with their words.

21:29] Sihon had taken it from Ar of Moab, people of Chimesh are lost from Dihon to Nopah to Medeba.

n21:29] <strong>אוי־לךֻ מואב &mdash;</strong> _Woe to you, O Moab_. This was the curse that led to Moab's defeat. They referred to Moab as the people of Chemosh, their deity (_Rashi_).

<strong>נתן &mdash;</strong> <em>He made</em>. "He" is the invader of Sihon, who made the son's and daughter of Moab helpless fugitives and captives <em>(Rashi)</em>; or it is the idol Chemosh, which abandoned its children in their time of distress (<em>Ramban</em>).

> What stands out here, is that <em>Ramban</em> is relating to this idol Chemosh as if it is a living entity that could "abandon its children...".

21:31-35] Israel settled in land of Amorite. Moses sent them to spy out Jazar. They conquered it. Turned by way of Bashan, Og, king of Bashan battled them at Edrei. They smote him, his sons and all his people, until there was no survivor left of him.

n33-35] <strong>Og does battle</strong>. Og was the last survivor of the huge giants of the generation of the Flood (see _Deuteronomy_ 3:11). Og had a quality that transcended size and strength. He was the fugitive who had warned Abraham that Lot had been kidnapped (_Genesis_ 14:13)
