<b>Revelation at Sinai</b>

The people were witnesseses to the Revelation at Sinai, but it was brief. Even if the 10 commandments had been given as "one" word, that the people saw, it would need to be expanded upon by the Sages so that the simple man could also understand what it was saying. As the first "word" emerged, they were already afraid, and retreated, saying "Let Moses tell us what the Lord wishes from us" &mdash; "and we will hear and we will obey".

Besides that brief moment of revelation, the rest of the story is about certain people, especially Moshe Rabeinu, transmitting the Divine Message and Wisdom to the people. Thus, besides the brief moment in which the people witnessed (had a vision of) G-d (even after having witnessed His many previous miracles &mdash; from the plagues to the splitting of the sea, etc.), the story of the transmission from the Divine to the Mundane is similar to most other faiths. [Is it that the story the precedes this nation building event is the one that differs?]

<h3>Neo-economics</h3>

Where else can the economic system move to but to greater control of all transactions. This was inevitable, but, as always, the control system (or controllers) is the issue that is in constant conflict. This is the dynamic between greater density with greater centralised control, and diverse, decentralised control mechanisims. The centrifugal and centripetal forces at odds, both just doing their thing.

If the centralised control system succeeds, it eventually produces a density that will eventually choke  the host. If it is too decentralised, and fluid, then it will eventually flat-line, and reach a state of rest.

**Parasha in Depth**

The second half of the book of Exodus—whose reading we concluded last week—was taken up primarily with the details of the Sanctuary's construction; in Exodus' concluding verses we read how the Sanctuary was erected and the Divine Presence came to dwell in it. Thus the Sanctuary commenced its function as the "Tent of Meeting" between G‑d and man: the place that is the focus of man's endeavor to serve his Creator, and where G‑d communicated to man and made His presence felt within a humanly constructed abode.

In the Parshah of Vayikra, which opens the book of Leviticus, G‑d speaks to Moses from the Tent of Meeting and begins His communication of the laws governing the bringing of the korbanot, the animal and meal offerings that are the central feature of the service performed in the Sanctuary.

_A man who shall bring near of you an offering to G‑d (1:2)_

The verse does not say "a man of you who shall bring near an offering," but "a man who shall bring near of you an offering"—the offering must come from within the person. It is the animal within man that must be "brought near" and elevated by the Divine fire upon the altar.

(The Chassidic Masters)

_A man (adam) who shall bring near of you an offering to G‑d (1:2)_

Why does G‑d use the word adam for "man" (instead of the more common synonym ish)? To teach us that a person cannot offer to G‑d what has not been honestly obtained by him. G‑d is saying: When you bring an offering to Me, be like Adam the first man, who could not have stolen from anyone, since he was alone in the world.

(Midrash Tanchuma; Rashi)

When we speak of Adam as one who "was alone in the world," we are speaking of the very first hours of his life. Thus we are speaking of Adam before he partook of the Tree of Knowledge—of man still unsullied by sin.

This is the deeper significance of the Torah's reference to the bearer of a korban—which has the power to obtain atonement for a transgression—as an "Adam." Every man, the Torah is saying, harbors in the pith of his soul a pristine "Adam," a primordial man untouched by sin. Even at the very moment when his external self was transgressing the Divine will, his inner essence remained loyal to G‑d; it was only silenced and suppressed by his baser instincts. It is by accessing this core of purity, by unearthing that part of himself that did not sin in the first place and restoring it to its rightful place as the sovereign of his life, that man attains the state of teshuvah—return to his original state of perfection.

(The Lubavitcher Rebbe)

___

The first _korban_ to be described is the _olah_, **the "ascending" offering**(commonly referred to as the "burnt offering"), whose distinguishing feature is that it is raised to G‑d, in its entirety, by the fire atop the altar.

**Meal offerings**, called _menachot_ ("gifts"), are prepared of fine flour, with olive oil and frankincense. The priest removes a kometz ("handful"—actually the amount grasped by his three middle fingers), to be burned on the altar; the remainder is eaten by the priests.

There are five types of donated meal offerings: 1) the standard "meal offering," brought as raw flour; 2) the "baked meal offering," which came in two forms: loaves or 3) flat matzot; 4) the "pan-fried" meal offering; 5) the minchat marcheshet, deep-fried in a pot.

The following rule applies to all the meal offerings (including the "loaves"):

> No meal offering which you shall bring to G‑d shall be made leavened; for you shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of G‑d made by fire . . .

Another rule is that

>Your every meal offering you shall season with salt; never shall you suspend the salt covenant of your G‑d.

This latter rule applies to all _korbanot_: "With all your offerings you shall offer salt."

Another meal offering mentioned here is the _minchat bikkurim_ (also called the _"Omer"_) brought on the second day of Passover from the year's very first barley harvest. In this _minchah_, the kernels are roasted by fire before they are ground into flour.

(In addition, a meal offering accompanied all animal offerings.)

---

...it is the same whether a person offers much or little, so long as he directs his heart to heaven.

(Talmud, Menachot 110a)

_No leaven . . . [shall be present] in any offering of G‑d (2:11)_

Leaven, which is dough that has fermented and risen, represents self-inflation and pride, and there is nothing more abhorrent to G‑d. In the words of the Talmud, "G‑d says of the prideful one, 'He and I cannot dwell together in the world.'"

(The Chassidic Masters)

**The Peace Offering**

The _shelamim_, or "peace offering," could be either male or female, and from either "the herd" (i.e., an ox or a cow) or "the flock" (a sheep or a goat).

Like the _olah_, its blood was sprinkled upon the altar; but unlike the _olah_, which "ascended" in its entirety upon the altar, the meat of the _shelamim_ was eaten by the "owner"—the one who brought the offering (two portions of the animal, the breast and the right thigh, were eaten by the priests). Only certain parts of the animal were burned on the fire atop the altar:

>The fat that covers the innards; all the fat that is upon the innards; the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks; and the appendage of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.

If the peace offering is a sheep, "the whole fat tail, up to the backbone" was added to these.

Because they are offered to G‑d on the altar, these specified veins of fat, which the Torah calls _cheilev_, are forbidden for consumption in all domestic animals: "It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your habitations: all _cheilev_ and all blood you shall not eat."

---

_No leaven nor any honey . . . in any offering of G‑d (2:11)_

Ultra-sweet honey and ultra-sour leaven are opposite extremes; G‑d does not like extremes.

(The Rebbe of Kotzk)

**Note**: Is that true?{.note}

---

_Never shall you suspend the salt covenant of your G‑d . . . with all your offerings you shall offer salt (2:13)_

When G‑d separated the supernal waters from the lower waters (see Genesis 1:6–8), He made a covenant with the lower waters that their salt will be offered on the altar.

(Rashi)

The korban, which was the vehicle of the elevation of the world to G‑d, had to include "representatives" of all four sectors of creation: the inanimate world, the vegetable world, the animal world and the human world. Thus the korban was offered by a human being, and consisted of an animal, grain and salt.

(Rabbi Isaac Luria)

**Note**: But why do we have to kill or consume them to enable them to be vehicles of the elevation to G-d?{.note}

---

When the Torah refers to the korbanot as "G‑d's bread," this is obviously a metaphor; but what is its significance? In what sense are we "feeding" G‑d when we offer up to Him ourselves and our material resources in the quest to serve Him?

Our sages have said that "G‑d fills the world as a soul fills a body." On the human level, food is what sustains "life," which is the assertion of the soul's powers via its physical vessel, the body. And so it is with the Divine life-force that suffuses the created existence: "G‑d's food" is what we would call whatever it is that asserts the Divine reality as a manifest presence in our physical world.

With our every act of serving G‑d, we fulfill the divine purpose of creation—that "there be for Him a dwelling in the physical realms." We thus breathe life into the world-body, asserting and manifesting its quintessence and soul.

(The Chassidic Masters)

**The Sin Offerings**

The _korbanot_ discussed up to this point are "donations"—offerings pledged out of a desire to give to G‑d. Now the Torah moves on to discuss obligatory offerings, such as the chatat, the "sin offering" brought to atone for an inadvertent transgression of the Divine will.

---

**Guilt Offerings**

For certain transgressions, the offering brought in atonement is not a "sin offering" but an _asham_ ("guilt offering"). An _asham_ is distinguished from the standard sin offering in that it was a male sheep, and that it had to be worth at least "two shekels of silver of the shekel of the Sanctuary."

Three types of _asham_ are described in our Parshah. The first is brought by one who unintentionally made unauthorized use of property belonging to the Sanctuary—a crime called me'ilah ("betrayal"). He must pay back what he had expropriated, adding to that an additional one-fifth of its value, and also bring an asham to obtain atonement for his unintentional trespass.

A second type of "guilt offering" is the _asham talui_, brought by one who thinks he may have unwittingly committed a transgression, but is not sure. (For example, he had two pieces of meat before him and ate one of them; later, he discovers that one of them was _cheilev_—forbidden fat—a trespass which would obligate him to bring a sin offering if he would know with certainty that he committed it.)

The third and last asham of our Parshah is the one brought in atonement by one who swears falsely in the process of defrauding his fellow man.

_If the anointed [high] priest sins to the guilt of the people (4:3)_

When a leader sins, this becomes the excuse for everyone else's wrongdoings.

(The Gaon of Lissa)

 Fortunate (ashrei) is the generation whose leader applies himself to atone for his errors.

(Talmud; Rashi)
