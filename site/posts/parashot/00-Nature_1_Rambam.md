וּלְטוֹטָפֹ֖ת '[_ultotaphot_](https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.16?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en)' &mdash; _Between your eyes_

</h3>

No affinity is known to this word. Linguists,[^399] however, associated it with the expressions: _‘v’hateiph’ (And speak) to the south;_[^400] _And my word ‘titoph’ (dropped) upon them_.[^401] Ramban evidently understands it: “and to them I spoke my word,” meaning “they followed my advice without question.” The figurative usage thereof is based on the verse: _And the mountains shall drop (‘v’hitiphu’) sweet wine_.[^402] Thus the verse is saying that you should make the exodus from Egypt a sign upon your hand, and between your eyes a source for discourse distilling as the dew upon those that hear it.[^403] Our Rabbis, however, have called an object which lies upon the head _totaphoth_, just as they have said: “[A woman] may not go out [on the Sabbath] with a _totepheth_ or head-bangles.”[^404]. Rabbi Abahu said: “What is _totepheth_? It is a forehead-band extending from ear to ear.”[^405] Now it is the Rabbis[^405a] who are the[^405b] linguists, as they spoke the language and knew it and it is from them that we should accept[^405c].

Now Scripture says _totaphoth_[^405d] and not _totepheth_[^405e] because there are many compartments in the phylacteries,[^406] just as we have received their form from the holy fathers[^407] who saw the prophets and the ancient ones up to Moses our teacher doing so.

Now the fundamental reason of this commandment is that we lay the script of the exodus from Egypt upon the hand and upon the head opposite the heart and the brain, which are the pivots of thought. Thus we are to inscribe[^407a] the Scriptural sections of _Kadesh_ (Sanctify unto Me)[^407b], and _V’haya ki y’viacha_ (And it shall be when the Eternal shall bring thee)[^407c], and enclose them in the phylacteries because of this commandment wherein we were charged to make the exodus from Egypt for frontlets between our eyes. [We are also to inscribe and enclose in the phylacteries the sections of] _Sh’ma_ (Hear O Israel)[^407d] and _V’haya im shamo’a_ (And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken)[^407e] because we are charged to have the commandments[^407f] also for frontlets between our eyes, as it is written: And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;[^408] and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.[^409] This is why we also inscribe[^409a] these two sections[^409b] for frontlets[^409c], for they contain the commandments of the Unity of G-d, the memorial Unity of G-d, the memorial of all commandments, the doctrine of retribution, which states that the consequence of disobeying the commandments is punishment and that blessings come in the wake of obedience — and the whole foundation of the faith.[^410] Now of the phylactery of the arm, Scripture says, _And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand_,[^411] which the Rabbis explained[^412] as referring to the left arm, which is opposite the heart.

By way of the Truth,[^412a], the verse, _It is because of ‘zeh’ (this) which the Eternal did for me_,[^413] is similar to _‘zeh’ (this) is my G-d, and I will glorify Him_.[^414] The verse here thus states that it was because of His name and His glory that He did for us and brought us forth out of Egypt. _And_ “this” _shall be for a sign unto thee_ on the arm of your strength,[^415] just as it is written, _For Thou art the glory of their strength_.[^416] Thus the sign[^416a] is similar to the sign of circumcision[^417] and the Sabbath.[^418] And since all[^418a] are one perfect unity, which is alluded to in “the sign” on the arm, our ancestors have received the tradition from Moses, who received it from the mouth of the Almighty, that[^418b] inscribed in the phylacteries, as described above[^406], are encased in one compartment. This is something like Scripture says, _achothi kalah_,[^419] because it is united and comprised of the thirty-two paths of wisdom[^420], and it is further written, _His left hand is under my head_.[^421]

Then Scripture says, And it shall be for a memorial between thine eyes,[^411] meaning that we are to lay them at the place of remembrance, which is between the eyes, at the beginning of the brain. It is there that remembrance begins by recalling the appearances[^421a] after they have passed away from us. These frontlets circle around the whole head with their straps, while the loop rests directly over the base of the brain which guards the memory. And the expression, between your expression, between your eyes, means that they are to be placed upon the middle of the head, not towards one side. It may be that in the middle of the head, there are the roots of the eyes and from these stems the power of sight.

Similarly, the verse, [Nor make ye any baldness between your eyes for the dead],[^422] is to explain this point[^422a], that He reverts here,[^422b] and says _‘ultotaphoth’_, _between your eyes_. This is in order to explain that the commandment is not fulfilled by placing the phylactery between the eyes bottomward, but rather it is to be placed high on the head where it is to be there like _totaphoth_.[^422c] He uses the plural form,[^422e] because the compartments in the phylactery of the head are many, as we have received the form by Tradition.

And now I shall declare to you a general principle in the reason of many commandments. Beginning with the days of Enosh[^423] when idol-worship came into existence, opinions in the matter of faith fell into error. Some people denied the root of faith by saying that the world is eternal; they denied the Eternal, and said: It is not He [Who called forth the world into existence][^424]. Others denied His knowledge of individual matters, and they say, _How does G-d know?_ and _is there knowledge in the Most High?_[^425] Some admit His knowledge but deny the principle of providence and make men as the fishes of the sea,[^426] [believing] that G-d does not watch over them and that there is no punishment or reward for their deeds, for they say _the Eternal hath forsaken the land_.[^427]

Now when G-d is pleased to bring about a change in the customary and natural order of the world for the sake of a people or an individual, then the voidance of all these [false beliefs] becomes clear to all people, since a wondrous miracle shows that the world has a G-d Who created it, and Who knows and supervises it, and Who has the power to change it. And when that wonder is previously prophesied by a prophet, another principle is further established, namely, that of the truth of prophecy, that _G-d doth speak with man_,[^428] and that _He reveals His counsel unto His servants the prophets_,[^429] and thereby the whole Torah is confirmed. This is why Scripture says in connection with the wonders:[^429a] _That thou_[^429b] _may know that I am the Eternal in the midst of the earth_,[^430] which teaches us the principle of providence, i.e., that G-d has not abandoned the world to chance, as they[^430a] would have it; _That you may know that the earth is the Eternal’s_,[^431] which informs us of the principle of creation, for everything is His since He created all out of nothing; _That thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth_,[^432] which indicates His might, i.e., that He rules over i.e., that He rules over everything and that there is nothing to withhold Him. The Egyptians either denied or doubted all of these[^432a] principles.[^432b]

Accordingly, it follows that the great signs and wonders constitute faithful witnesses[^433] to the truth of the belief in the existence of the Creator and the truth of the whole Torah. Because the Holy One, blessed be He, will not make signs and wonders in every generation for the eyes of some wicked man or heretic, He therefore commanded us that we should always make a memorial or sign of that which we have seen with our eyes, and that we should transmit the matter to our children, and their children to their children, to the generations to come, and He placed great emphasis on it, as is indicated by the fact that one is liable to extinction for eating leavened bread on the Passover, or for abandoning the Passover-offering[^433a].[^434]

He has further required of us that we inscribe upon our arms and between our eyes all that we have seen in the way of signs and wonders, and to inscribe it yet upon the doorposts of the houses, and that we remember it by recital in the morning and evening — just as the Rabbis have said: “The recital of the benediction _True and firm_[^434a] is obligatory as a matter of Scriptural law because it is written, _That thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life_.[^435] [He further required] that we make a booth every year[^436] and many other commandments like those which are a memorial to the exodus from Egypt.

All these commandments are designed for the purpose that in all generations we should have testimonies to the wonders so that they should not be forgotten and so that the heretic should not be able to open his lips to deny the belief in[^436a] G-d. He who buys a _Mezuzah_[^437] for one silver coin[^437a], affixes it to his doorpost and has the proper intent of heart on its content, has already admitted the creation of the world, the Creator’s knowledge and His providence, and also his belief in prophecy as well as in all fundamental principles of the Torah, besides admitting that the mercy of the Creator is very great upon them that do His will, since He brought us forth from that bondage to freedom and to great honour on account of the merit of our fathers who delighted in the fear of His Name.[^438] It is for this reason that the Rabbis have said:[^439] “Be as heedful of a light commandment[^440] as of a weighty one,” for they are all exceedingly precious and beloved, for through them a person always expresses thankfulness to his G-d.

And the purpose of all the commandments is that we believe in our G-d and are thankful to Him for having created us, for we know of no other reason for the first creation,[^441] and G-d the Most High has no demand on the lower creatures, excepting that man should know and be thankful to G-d for having created him. The purposes of raising our voices in prayer and of the service in synagogues, as well as the merit of public prayer, is precisely this: that people should have a place wherein they assemble and express their thankfulness to G-d for having created them and supported them, and thus proclaim and say before Him, “We are your creatures.”

This is the intent of what the Rabbis of blessed memory have said:[^442] _“And they cried mightily unto G-d_.[^443] From here you learn that prayer must be accompanied by sound. The undaunted one wins over the abashed one.”

</div>

For no one can have a part in the Torah of Moses our teacher unless he believes that all our words and our events,[^443a]  are miraculous in scope, there being no natural or customary way of the world in them, whether affecting the public or the individual. Instead, if a person observes the commandments, His reward will bring him success, and if he violates them, His punishment will cause his extinction. It is all by decree of the Most High, as I have already mentioned.[^444] The hidden miracles done to the public come to be known as is mentioned in the assurances of the Torah on the subject of the blessings and imprecations,[^445] as the verse says: _And all the nations shall say: Wherefore hath the Eternal done thus unto this land? … Then men shall say: Because they forsook the covenant of the Eternal, the G-d of their fathers_.[^446] Thus it will become known to all nations that their punishment came from G-d. And of the fulfilment of the commandments it says, _And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Eternal is called upon thee_.[^447] I will yet explain this, with the help of G-d.[^448]

[^410]: “The whole foundation of the faith.” This may refer to the principle of the Unity of G-d which is indeed the root of faith, as Ramban describes it in [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.4). However, in view of the fact that this principle has already been explicitly mentioned here by Ramban, the reference must be to some other doctrine. It is reasonable to assume that Ramban is here alluding to a point he has explained in many places — “a true principle, clearly indicated in the Torah… that in the entire scope of the Torah there are only miracles, and no nature or custom.” (See Vol. I, pp. 556-7; see also his commentary above, 6:2, and on [Leviticus 26:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.26.11).) The theme appears also in his introduction to the Commentary on the Book of Job (_Kithvei Haramban_, Vol. I, pp. 17-19). In his “Sermon on the Perfection of the Torah,” (_Ibid_., p. 153) as well as at the end of this Seder, he states clearly that “a person has no part in the Torah of Moses our teacher” unless he believes in this principle. It is thus logical to assume that “the whole foundation of the faith” mentioned here is a reference to the above principle.

[^419]: Song of Songs 5:1. Literally, “my sister, the bride,” but here interpreted on the basis of the Hebrew roots which suggest “unity” (_achothi_, my sister — _echad_, one) and “totality” (_kalah_, bride — kol, all), as explained in the text. See also Vol. I, p. 292, where Ramban refers to this theme.

[^420]: Sefer Yetzirah 1:1 [with which the world was created].

[^421]: Song of Songs 2:6.

[^421a]: [of persons and events]

[^422]: [Deuteronomy 14:1](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.14.1). See Rashi, _ibid_., that the expression _between the eyes_ means on the head adjoining the forehead. See also Rashi to [Leviticus 21:5](https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.21.5) [means baldness adjoining the forehead. Thus the expression between your eyes mentioned here in the case of the frontlets also refers to the identical place].

[^422a]: [i.e., that the phylactery of the head is not to be placed between the eyes, as the literal meaning of the words might indicate, but that it is to be placed upon the middle of the head adjoining the forehead]

[^422b]: [in Verse 16 and instead of using the expression, _and for ‘a memorial’ between your eyes_, as stated in Verse 9]

[^422c]: [and we have seen above that the word _totepheth_ was used by the Rabbis for an object which lies upon the head]

[^422e]: [_totaphoth_, and not the singular _totepheth_]

[^423]: [Genesis 4:26](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.4.26). See also _Rambam_, _Mishneh Torah_, _Hilchoth Akum_ 1:1, where he traces the process of intellectual degeneration by which mankind fell into gross idolatry. Ramban primarily follows here the process of deterioration as affecting the three basic principles of faith: the existence of the Creator, His providence over the world, and the truth of prophecy. The chief purpose of the commandments of the Torah is to guard Israel against deviating from these principles.

[^436a]: [the existence of]

[^437]: Literally: “door-post.” It is a scroll of parchment on which are written the two Scriptural portions, [Deuteronomy 6:4-9](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.4-9) and [11:13-21](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.13-21), and which is fastened to the right-hand door-post.

[^437a]: This silver coin was called a _zuz_.

[^438]: See [Nehemiah 1:11](https://www.sefaria.org/Nehemiah.1.11).

[^439]: Aboth 2:1.

[^440]: Here understood in the sense of a commandment, the fulfilment of which does not entail a great expense, just like a _Mezuzah_ that can be bought for one zuz and affixed to the door-post.

[^441]: “The first creation.” In his “_Sermon on the Perfection of the Torah_,” where Ramban discusses the same topic (_Kithvei Haramban_, Vol. I, p. 152), the text reads: “for we know of no other reason for ‘the creation of man.’” See, however, my Hebrew commentary, in the fifth edition, p. 557, where I suggest that the term “the first creation” may be a reference to the period from Adam to Abraham.
