## Chapter 37

v1] Settles in Canaan. Tale of Isaac's sojournings.
v2] Joseph's bad tidings regarding his brothers ([לשׁון רע]{dir="rtl"}).
v3] Tunic for Joseph.
v4] His brothers hate him.
v5] Joseph's first dream: The sheafs bow down to him
v9] Another dream. The sun, his father, the moon, his mother, and eleven stars, his brothers, bow to him.
v11] Brothers are jealous of him. His father ["ואביב שׁמר את־הדבר"]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; "kept it (the thing) in his mind".

[דבר]{dir="rtl"}: "He held onto the thing": Where it does not represent a "thing", a material object, but rather refers to an event.{.note}

Could one say that [לדבר]{dir="rtl"} is to literally creat something? For example, Adam "naming" the animals calls them into existence. What if we thought about our words that way &mdash; would we not be more careful with them?{.note}

v12] "Brothers went with their flock to Shechem"

[שׁצמ]{dir="rtl} &mdash; _Shechem_: A place of dislocation, with time dilations. Shechem still exists? After it was destroyed by Simeon and Levi? Did they not just kill all the men, take the women and childrenand livestock?{.note}

Did not Jacob flee from the site of this massacre? How come he (i) has a flock in Shechem; (ii) Is in the vicinity of Shechem?

v13-14] [הנני]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; Jacob calls Jacob to him. "send you to them" [רואה את־שׁלום אחיך]{dir="rtl"}

**Note**: Why was he not with his brothers, tending the sheep? Why send him now?

v15-16] "A man discovered him".

v14 Jacob sent Joseph to his brothers, and it says "he arrived...".

Yet now we have him wondering in the fields, presumably lost, and happens to bum into some "man" who just happens to know who and where is brothers happen to be. As if that is not strange enough, he also just happens to have heard them saying, [שׁלכה דותָינה]{dir="rtl"} &ndash; "Let us go to Dotan". This is quite incredible. Almost miraculous.{.note}

Do we just accept such occurances occur in this story, the Holy Tombe? Perhaps because we do not understand the bible, so we have to [דיכוּג]{dir="rtl"}, _skip over_, the confusing &mdash; whether mentally or emotionally &mdash; parts.

Or is it because it was another time, another place, when G-d appeared to men, and the spoke with Him? When these type of miraculous events occurred "naturally"?

Then let me ask, do these types of synchonicities not happen in your life too? Are we not blind to the miraculous that we are surround by as well as an expression of?

Here again we have another reference to an _angel_ that appears in the guise of a _man_, and is again referred toa as [אישׁ]{dir="rtl"}, _ish_, man.
