## Chapter 37

v37:1] Settles in Canaan. Tale of Isaac's sojournings.
v37:2] Joseph's bad tidings regarding his brothers ([לשׁון רע]{.heb}).
v37:3] Tunic for Joseph.
v37:4] His brothers hate him.
v37:5] Joseph's first dream: The sheafs bow down to him
v37:9] Another dream. The sun, his father, the moon, his mother, and eleven stars, his brothers, bow to him.
v37:11] Brothers are jealous of him. His father ["ואביב שׁמר את־הדבר"]{.heb} &mdash; "kept it (the thing) in his mind".

[דבר]{.heb}: "He held onto the thing".

[**N**: Where here it does not represent a "thing", a material object, but rather refers to an event.]{.note}

Could one say that [לדבר]{.heb} is to literally create something? For example, Adam "naming" the animals calls them into existence. What if we thought about our words that way &mdash; would we not be more careful with them?{.note}

v37:12] "Brothers went with their flock to Shechem"

[שׁצמ]{.heb} &mdash; _Shechem_: A place of dislocation, with time dilations.

**N**: Shechem still exists? After it was destroyed by Simeon and Levi? Did they not just kill all the men, take the women and childrenand livestock?{.note}

Did not Jacob flee from the site of this massacre? How come he (i) has a flock in Shechem; (ii) Is in the vicinity of Shechem?{.note}

v37:13-14] [הנני]{.heb} &mdash; Jacob calls Jacob to him. "send you to them" [רואה את־שׁלום אחיך]{.heb}

**N**: Why was he not with his brothers, tending the sheep? Why send him now?{.note}

v37:15-16] "A man discovered him".

v37:14 Jacob sent Joseph to his brothers, and it says "he arrived...".

Yet now we have him wondering in the fields, presumably lost, and happens to bum into some "man" who just happens to know who and where is brothers happen to be. As if that is not strange enough, he also just happens to have heard them saying, [שׁלכה דותָינה]{.heb} &ndash; "Let us go to Dotan". This is quite incredible. Almost miraculous.{.note}

<summary class='button is-outlined'>
Miraculous &nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>
</summary>

Do we just accept such events occur in this story, the Holy Tombe? Perhaps because we do not understand the bible, so we have to [דיכוּג]{.heb}, _skip over_, the confusing &mdash; whether mentally or emotionally &mdash; parts.

Or is it because it was another time, another place, when G-d appeared to men, and the spoke with Him? When these type of miraculous events occurred "naturally"?

Then let me ask, do these types of synchronicities not happen in your life too? Are we not blind to the miraculous that we are surround by as well as an expression of?

<summary class='button is-outlined'>
Angel/man &nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>
</summary>

Here again we have another reference to an _angel_ that appears in the guise of a _man_, and is again referred to as [אישׁ]{.heb}, _ish_, man. [וימצהוּ]{.heb} &mdash; so he was "looking" for him. Thus this even was important enough for an angel to be sent to Joseph who was wondering around, lost in the fields.

This makes me think of him as a dreamer, already in connection with other realms, and would have wondered in the fields until dark... then perhaps returned home. But then the narrative of his future, and that of our people, would not have unfolded as it did. Thus angels are not only to "protect" us, their purpose is obviously to "help" you fulfil your destiny.

</details>

v37:16] His brothers conspire to "kill" him - or, to use an euphemism, get rid of him.
v37:21] Rueben intervenes.
v37:23] Take his tunic. Throw Joseph into a pit.
v37:25] Sit and eat [**N**: To sit and enjoy your dinner while your brother is stuck in a pit, crying out for help! That is heartless.]{.note}. Ishmaelite caravan come past.
v37:26] Judah suggests that they sell him
v37:28] They sell him for 20 pieces of silver to the Midianite traders
v37:29] Rueven returns to pit. [**N**: Where was he? Where did he go, and why?]. He is upset at what his brothers did.
v37:31] Dip his tunic in goat's blood.
v37:32] They dispatch (ישׁלחוּ) and brought (יביאוּ) the tunic to Jacob.
v37:33-35] Jacob is bereft.
v37:36] Potiphar :: Josph ends up in the hands of Potiphar, who is the chamberlain of the butchers (ֹשׂר הטבחים).

### Chapter 38 - Tamar

v38:1] [וַיֵט עד־אישׁ עַדוּלָמי וּשׁמו חִירָה]{.heb} &mdash; Judah leaves his brothers and goes to Chirah.
v38:2] He marries [עֵר]{.heb}, Air, and has [אונן]{.heb}, Onan, and [שׁוּעַ]{.heb}, Shu'a.
v38:6] Tamar marries Onan.
v38:8] Onan witholds his seed from Tamar. This is considered an evil deed.
v38:12] Shu'a dies.
v38:13- ] Tamar tricks Judah. Gives birth to Perez and Zerach.

### Chapter 39 - The trials of Joseph

> [וַיֵט אליו חסד]{.heb} &mdash; _Mercy was placed upon him_ or "he was blessed".

Now begin the trials of Joseph, which he seems to breeze through, because "[יהי ה’ את־יוֹֹסף]{.heb}", _The Lord was with Joseph_.

v39:5] 1st time

n39:5] [ויהי ה’ את יוסף. ויהי אישׁ מצליח]{.heb}

The Lord appeared to him; He spoke to him; appeared to him in dreams for "The Lord was with Joseph". The result was that he was successful and prospered and become the chaimberlain of Potaphar's house. This was because his master "saw the Lord was with him".

v39:6] Joseph was handsome

Trouble with Potiphar's wife.
Thrown into prison... Even in prison the Lord was with him (charisma?)

**N**: Love is as strong as death, and envy as harsh as the  grave.{.note}

### Chapter 40

## Notes

Could Joseph, thrown into slavery by his brothers rise so quickly to become the Chamberlain in Potiphar's house by following the straight and narrow road? By being always straight, never bending, full of integrity and honesty?

Not in our reality, say I. Never, in the history of humankind has anyone risen to power without being able to negotiate the shark-infested waters of power politics. The exceptions are those who ascended the throne through some unexpected destiny, but had not sought it at all during their lives.

Thus perhaps Joseph was having an affair with Potiphar's wife? Perhaps that is part of his ascendence, and subsequent jailing &mdash; as a consequence of his lack of integrity. Does it not say (verse) that "the Divine abandoned him" at some point. Perhaps he got too cocky in his rise to power. We all have to taste those bitter waters to realise that power only comes from G-d, otherwise it is perverse and will become demonic.
