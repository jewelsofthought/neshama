## <a href="https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/383052/jewish/Behar-Bechukotai-Roundup.htm" alt="Round up">Round up</a>

In Parshat Bechukotai, we read about the promises that G‑d gives us if we keep the Torah and carry out the _Mitzvot_:

- rain will come when we need it to make the crops grow
- there will be enough food and everybody will eat until they are satisfied
- we will have peace and security in the land
- no wild beasts or armies will pass through the land
- we will be successful in our battles and victorious over armies much larger than ours
- and G‑d will be with us.

But, then the Torah tells us that if the people don't keep the commandments, and forget about their agreement with G‑d, then many unfortunate things will happen. But even if G‑d is angry at the Jews and must punish them, he will never forget or abandon them.

The last thing we learn in the Parshah is how to calculate the value of different types of gifts that people promise to G‑d.

## My Laws & Statutes

v26:3] If you follow My statutes
<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ג. אִם־בְּחֻקֹּתַ֖י תֵּלֵ֑כוּ וְאֶת־מִצְו‍ֹתַ֣י תִּשְׁמְר֔וּ וַֽעֲשִׂיתֶ֖ם אֹתָֽם:
</p>
  <p>
3. If you follow My statutes and observe My commandments and perform them,
  </p>
</blockquote>

Only G-d has issued decrees based on the Ten Commandments. Kings and Governments with emergency powers, issue decrees and edicts as well.

n26:3] [אִם־בְּחֻקֹּתַי תֵּלֵכוּ]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _If you follow My statutes_. It means that you must toil in the study of Torah [for the word for “follow” here, [תֵּלֵכוּ]{dir="rtl"}, literally means “walk,” which is a strenuous activity (_Gur Aryeh_)]. — [_Torath Kohanim_ 26:2]

n26:5] * Busy

n26:6] [וְנָֽתַתִּי שָׁלוֹם] {dir="rtl"} &mdash; _And I will grant peace_. You might say, “Here is food, and here is drink, but if there is no peace, there is nothing!” Scripture, therefore, states, after all this [blessing], “I will grant peace in the Land.” From here, [we learn] that peace is equal to everything else. And so, [this is illustrated in our morning prayers,] when we say: “[Blessed are You, O Lord…] Who… makes peace and creates everything” [a paraphrase of the verse] ([_Isaiah_ 45:7](https://www.chabad.org/15976#v7)). - [see _Ber_. 11b; Torath Kohanim 26:7].

n26:9] [וְהִפְרֵיתִ֣י אֶתְכֶ֔ם וְהִרְבֵּיתִ֖י אֶתְכֶ֑ם]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _and I will make you fruitful and increase you_. [Unlike the usual expression of [פִּרְיָה וְרִבְיָה]{dir="rtl"} in Scripture, here, the two parts of this expression are separated by the word [אֶתְכֶם]{dir="rtl"} (_Sifthei Chachamim_ quoting _Maharal_). The first part, [וְהִפְרֵיתִי אֶתְכֶם]{dir="rtl"}, refers to the blessing of] being fruitful and multiplying. — [_Torath Kohanim_ 26:12].  [while the second
part,] [וְהִרְבֵּיתִי אֶתְכֶם]{dir="rtl"} [refers to the blessing of having] dignity of stature [[(הִתְרַבְרְבוּת)]{dir="rtl"} i.e., being able to hold one’s head up high due to dignity]. — [_Mizrachi_; _Torath Kohanim_ 26:12]

n26:9] [וַֽהֲקִֽימֹתִי אֶת־בְּרִיתִי אֶתְכֶם]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; _and I will set up My covenant with you_. A new covenant, not like the first covenant, which you broke, but a new covenant, which will not be broken, as it is said, “I will form a new covenant with the House of Israel and with the House of Judah-not like the covenant [that I formed with their forefathers… that they broke]” ([Jer. 31:30-31](https://www.chabad.org/16028#v30)). - [_Torath Kohanim_ 26:12]

v26:10] Old [produce]

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
י. וַֽאֲכַלְתֶּ֥ם יָשָׁ֖ן נוֹשָׁ֑ן וְיָשָׁ֕ן מִפְּנֵ֥י חָדָ֖שׁ תּוֹצִֽיאוּ:
</p>
  <p>
10. You will eat (devour, consume, destroy) the stale and the obsolete, and you will clear (bring) out the old before the new (will arrive).
  </p>
</blockquote>

Remember, this is a commandment.

[יָשָׁ֖ן]{dir="rtl"} To be slack, languid, sleep, to grow old, stale, inveterate when you need to clear it out

v26:11-13] G-d will be with us

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
יא. וְנָֽתַתִּ֥י מִשְׁכָּנִ֖י בְּתֽוֹכְכֶ֑ם וְלֹֽא־תִגְעַ֥ל נַפְשִׁ֖י אֶתְכֶֽם:
יב. וְהִתְהַלַּכְתִּי֙ בְּת֣וֹכְכֶ֔ם וְהָיִ֥יתִי לָכֶ֖ם לֵֽאלֹהִ֑ים וְאַתֶּ֖ם תִּֽהְיוּ־לִ֥י לְעָֽם:
יג. אֲנִ֞י יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֗ם אֲשֶׁ֨ר הוֹצֵ֤אתִי אֶתְכֶם֙ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם מִֽהְיֹ֥ת לָהֶ֖ם עֲבָדִ֑ים וָֽאֶשְׁבֹּר֙ מֹטֹ֣ת עֻלְּכֶ֔ם וָֽאוֹלֵ֥ךְ אֶתְכֶ֖ם קֽוֹמְמִיּֽוּת:
</p>
  <p>
And I will place My dwelling in your midst, and My Spirit will not reject you; I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be My people.
</p><p>
I am the Lord, your God, Who took you out of the land of Egypt from being slaves to them; and I broke the pegs of your yoke and led you upright.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**N**: First the verse that talks about getting rid of the old, and then G-d says he will "dwell in our midst".{.note}

n26:11] [וְלֹֽא־תִגְעַל נַפְשִׁי] {dir="rtl"} &mdash; _My Spirit will not be disgusted with you_. Every [expression of] גְּעִילָה is an expression of the purging of something that had been absorbed by something else.

n26:14-15 - 7 sins:

1. Do not listen to Me
2. Do not perform all these commandments
3. Despise my statutes - one who despises others who perform the commandments [_Torath Kohanim_ 26:18].
4. Reject my ordinances - one who hates the Sages [_Torath Kohanim_ 26:18].
5. Do not perform - one who prevents others from fulfilling the commandments [_Torath Kohanim_ 26:18].
6. Any of My commandments - one who denies that I [G-d] commanded them [_Torath Kohanim_ 26:18].
7. Break my covenant - denies the main tenet [of Judaism, namely, that God is the Omnipotent Creator of all existence (_Torath Kohanim_ 26:18).].
  
[This verse has enumerated] seven sins, the first leading to the second, and so on, until the seventh, [and the process of degeneration is] as follows:

1. [First, a person] does not learn [the Torah]; then
2. he [subsequently] does not fulfil [the commandments];
3. he then despises others who do [fulfil them]; then
4. he hates the Sages,
5. prevents others from fulfilling [the commandments],
6. denies the [authenticity of the] commandments and 7
7. [finally] denies the very omnipotence of God.

n26:16 - 7 punishments

1. shock
2. consumption
3. fever
4. diseases that cause hopeless longing and
5. depression
6. sow your seed in vain
7. enemies will eat it

n26:24 - "If your refuse to see G-d, He withdraws His Prescience ([הסתר פנים]{dir='rtl'} &mdash; _Hiddeness of the Countenance_) making it harder to recognise the Truth.

n26:30 - Not Divinely ordained (Ibn Ezra).
1
n26:42 - [יעקוב]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; Missing _vav_.
n26:44 - Exile: Would not tbe same thing happen in present day Israel?

## Chapter 27

v27:2]

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ב. דַּבֵּ֞ר אֶל־בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ וְאָֽמַרְתָּ֣ אֲלֵהֶ֔ם אִ֕ישׁ כִּ֥י יַפְלִ֖א נֶ֑דֶר בְּעֶרְכְּךָ֥ נְפָשֹׁ֖ת לַֽיהֹוָֽה:
</p>
  <p>
2. Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When a man expresses a vow, [pledging the] value of lives to the Lord
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Q**: Not sure what context this is in. In what circumstances could someone be pledged (by another) to the Lord?{.note}

v27:29]

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
כט. כָּל־חֵ֗רֶם אֲשֶׁ֧ר יָֽחֳרַ֛ם מִן־הָֽאָדָ֖ם לֹ֣א יִפָּדֶ֑ה מ֖וֹת יוּמָֽת:
</p>
  <p>
29. Any devoting of a person who has been devoted, need not be redeemed [for] he is to be put to death.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**N**: Does this refer back to v27:2, where a person has been vowed to the Lord? And under what circumstances would he be redeemed.

**N**: **Holy shekel**: Perhaps the Holy shekel is referring to the standard that the a shekel is weighed by. It is the "standard" weight.
