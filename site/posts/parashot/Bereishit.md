n1] **Introduction**
The Torah is not a history book, but the charter of man's mission in the universe. _Rashi_ explains that the reason for the Torah's narrative of Creation is to establish that G-d is the Sovereign of the universe.

As _Rambam_ notes, even after reading how the world and its central character, Man, came into being, we still do not understand thesecret of even the process of Creation. Rather the work of Creation is a deep mystery that can be comprehended (only) through (the) a tradition transmitted by G-d (to Moses). Those who are privileged with this hidden knowledge are not permitted to reveal it. What we do know is that Adam and Chava, the forerunners of humanity, had the mission of bringing about the fulfilment of Creation (by carrying out G-d's commandment). They failed and were driven into _exile_.[^1]

Man's mission did not change, however, only the conditions in which it would be carried out... They could repent; indeed, the concept of repentance was a prerequisite to Man's existence, because he could not have survived without it.

_Ramban_ claims that the essence of creation is the story of the birth of Israel, the nation that inherited the task of Adam and Chava. He comments that the Torah relates the story of the six days of Creation _ex nihilo_ to establish that G-d is the sole Creator and to refute the theories of those who claim that the universe is timeless or that it came into being through some massive coincidence or accident... The story of Creation tells of when the major categories of the universe came into existence only in very general terms, because its primary purpose is to state that nothing came into being except at G-d's command.

n1:1] [בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית בָּרָ֣א אֱלֹהִ֑ים]{dir="rtl"} &mdash; <i>In the beginning of G-d's creating.</i> This phrase is commonly rendered <i>In the beginning G-d created</i>, which would indicate that the Torah is giving us the sequence of Creation &mdash; that G-d created the heaven, then the earth, darkness, water, light and so on.

According to _Rambam_ and most other commentators, the verse ... begins with a general statement: <i>At the very first moment</i> &mdash; from absolute nothingness &mdash; <i>G-d created heaven and earth</i>, i.e., the basic substance from which He then fashioned the universe as we know it... The chapter continues the day-to-day process until it reaches its climax in the Creation of Man &mdash; the prime goal of Creation.

Homiletically, the word בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית can be written בּישׁבִיל רֵאשִׁית, <i>[the world was created] for the sake of [the things that are called] "beginning"</i>... The implication is that the purpose of Creation is to enable Jews to dedicate their first efforts and success to the service of G-d.[^2]

n1:1] <b>אֱלֹהִ֑ים</b> &mdash; <i>G-d (Elohim)</i>. This Name denotes G-d in His Attribute of Justice ([מִדַּת הַדּין]{dir="rtl"})... By using this Name exclusively in the narrative of Creation, the Torah indicates that [the Divine Standard of] Justice is the ideal state of the world, meaning that Man should be treated exactly as he deserves, according to his deeds. However, because Man is not virtuous enough to survive such hard scrutiny, G-d added His Attribute of Mercy to the story of Creation, so that judgement would be tempered with mercy, [and that is the reason it is written: "on the day the Lord made earth and heaven" (Gen. 2:4)].

    <b>בראשית ברא:</b> <i>In the beginning of G-d's creation of</i>. This verse calls for a Midrashic interpretation because, according to its simple interpretation, the vowelisation of the word <b>בָּרָ֣א</b>, should be different. It teaches us that the sequence of the Creation as written is impossible, ... but if you wish to explain it according to its simple meaning, explain it thus: "At the beginning of the creation of heaven and earth, the earth was astonishing with emptiness and darkness...and G-d said, 'Let there be light.'" But Scripture did not come to teach the sequence of the Creation, to say that these came first, for if it came to teach this, it should have written: “At first (<b>בָּרִאשׁוֹנָה</b>) He created the heavens and the earth,” for there is no <b>רֵאשִׁית</b> in Scripture that is not connected to the following word,  [i.e., in the construct state] like (ibid. 27:1): “In the beginning of (<b>בְּרֵאשִית</b>) the reign of Jehoiakim” ; (below 10:10) “the beginning of (<b>רֵאשִׁית</b>) his reign”; (Deut. 18:4) “the first (<b>רֵאשִׁית</b>) of your corn.” Here too, you say <b>בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אלֹהִים</b>, like <b>בְּרֵאשִׁית בְּרֹא</b>, in the beginning of creating. Now if you say that it came to teach that these (i.e., heaven and earth) were created first, and that its meaning is: In the beginning of all, He created these&ndash;and that there are elliptical verses that omit one word, ... and it does not explain that [it means] telling the end of a matter from the beginning of a matter-if so, (if you say that Scripture indicates the order of creation) be astounded at yourself, for the water preceded, as it is written: “and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water,” and Scripture did not yet disclose when the creation of water took place! From this you learn that the water preceded the earth. Moreover, the heavens were created from fire and water. Perforce, you must admit that Scripture did not teach us anything about the sequence of the earlier and the later [acts of creation]

n1:4] <b>וַיַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֶת־הָא֖וֹר כִּי־ט֑וֹב</b> &mdash; <i>G-d saw that...was good.</i>In the plain sense, G-d saw that the light was good.

According to the Midrash, the original light was of an intense spiritual quality and _God saw_ that it was not proper for the wicked to use it. so He separated it for the righteous in the World to Come.

According to its simple meaning: He saw it that it was good, and it was unseemly that it [light] and darkness should serve in confusion; so He established for this one its boundary by day, and for that one its boundary by night (_Rashi_). "G-d summoned the light and appointed it for duty by day, and He summoned the darkness and appointed it for duty by night" (see v.5 and _Pesachim_ 2a).

The term _it was good_ means that the creation of the item under discussion was completed. _Ramban_ maintains that it means ... that "G-d decreed permanence to the phenomenon under discussion"&ndash;in this case the light, which required no further perfection. The waters, however, did not receive their final form until the third day.[^4]

Rashi 1:5] <b>י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד</b> &mdash; <i>one day</i>. According to the sequence of the language of the chapter, it should have been written, “the first day,” as it is written regarding the other days, “second, third, fourth.” Why did Scripture write “one”? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, was the only one in His world, for the angels were not created until the second day. [i.e., יוֹם אֶחָד can be understood as ‘the day of the One and only’]. So is it explained in Genesis Rabbah (3:8).[^5]

</blockquote>

n1:6] <b>Second Day</b>. The heavens had been created on Day One, but they were still in a state of flux. On the second day, at G-d's command, _"Let there be a firmament,"_ seperated the waters above from the waters below (_Rashi_). According to _Rambam_, the separation mentioned is between the spiritual, extraterrestrial aspects of Creation, and the tangible world that is within the province of Man [which would include even the furthest reaches of the solar system].

"Those who understand the explanation are forbidden to reveal it. For those who do not understand, [it is forbidden to speculate about the unknown]." The "firmament" and the "upper and lower waters" are among the mysteries of Creation that are either unknowable to Man or must be limited to those qualified to know about them.

This is the only day regarding which the Torah does say כי טוב, _it was good_. _Rashi_ explains that this is used only for a finished creation, but the waters, which were begun on the second day, were not completed till the third day.

The Midrash has a different reason. The waters were divided on this day, symbolising strife, which occurs when the bonds that unite people are broken. Schism and dispute cannot be called good.

_Rabbeinu Bachaya_ comments that this day was not called good, because the creation of the angels and the firmament, though momentous, was not the prime purpose of Creation. Rather the prime purpose of Creation is the "lower world", the world where Man does his work of bringing G-d's plan to fruition. Only when Man's interest are served do the heavens and the heavenly beings justify their existence. "the righteous are greater than the ministering angels" (_Sanhedrin_ 93a).

n9-13] <b>Third day.</b> On the third day, G-d decreed boundaries for the water, making way for the development of land, vegetation, animal life, and, ultimately, Man... The water threatened to flood the earth until G-d forced it back... (<i>Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer; Zohar</i>) This ... means that G-d determines the proper limits &mdash; to Creation itself and to an individualhuman being's resources and suffering. The concept of G-d as determining what is sufficient and setting limits is alluded to in His Name <i>Shaddai</i>, from which the word דַּי, <i>enough</i>, or <i>sufficient</i>. As Talmudic literature puts it: <b>מִי שֵׁאָמַר לְאוֹלָמוֹ דַּי</b>, <i>He Who said to His world, "It is enough!</i> [See 17:1].[^6]

n1:10] <b>אֵרֵץ</b> &mdash; <i>Earth.</i> This name is from רצה, _to desire_, i.e., it desired to do G-d's will. G-d began by creating one rock; and it rushed to expand in order to fulfil His desire (_Bereishit Rabbah_ 5:7).[^7]

n1:14-19] <b>Fourth Day</b>. All the potentials of heaven and earth were created on the first day but each was set in place on the day it was commanded.(_Rashi_).

n1:14] The _Vilna Gaon_ notes that the creations of the first three days paralleled and complemented one another. On the first day light was created, on the fourth day luminaries were set in place. On the second day, seas and atmosphere, on the fifth day, aquatic and bird life, and on the third dry land and vegetation, and populated on the sixth.

n1:24] <b>תּוֹצֵ֨א</b> &mdash; <i>Bring forth.</i>This implies that a concealed dormant presence was brought into existence (_Ahavat Yonatan_). As explained earlier, the potential for everything was created on the first day; it was necessary to _bring them forth_ (_Rashi_).

n1:24] <b>נֶ֤פֶשׁ חַיָּה֙</b> &mdash; <i>Living creatures.</i> These were independently living, breathing beings, capable of reproducing their own species... The term could also include any living thing not specifically mentioned, as, for example, "germs" (_R' Munk_).

n1:25]<b>כִּי טוֹב</b> &mdash; <i>That it was good.</i> As noted above, this expression of approval always applies to a facet of Creation after it was complete... Man, however, is in a different category. His creation os not followed by a similar declaration of approval, because Man's creation

"Write!" G-d replied. "Whoever wishes to err will err..." The implication of this response is that **one who sincerely seeks the truth will see it; one who looks for an excuse to blaspheme will find it**.

n2:1-3] <b>The Sabbath.</b> This passage proclaims that G-d is the Creator Who brought the universe into being [in six days], and then rested [on the seventh]... The bridge between the mundane and the sacred, between the weekday and the Sabbath, is Man. Only Man has the ability to bring the holiness of the Sabbath into the activities of the weekweek. Of all the creatures in the universe, only he can _create_ holiness. Angels _are_ holy, but they are static. They cannot improve themselves or the world, only Man can do both. Indeed, **Man's activities transfrom the universe from an apparently aimless amalgamation of matter into the mirror of G-d's will.**

n2:1] <b>וַיְכֻלּ֛וּ</b> &mdash; <i>Were finished.</i> Homiletically, the Midrash relates this word to כִּלַיון, _longing_, and כְּלִי, _utensil_.

Rashi n2:4] <b>תולדות השמים והארץ בהבראם ביום עשות</b> &mdash; <i>when they were created, on the day that the Lord...made. </i> This teaches that they were all created on the first day (<i>Gen Rabbah</i> 12:4).

Another explanation of the word <b>בְּהִבָּרְאָם</b>, He <i>created them with the letter “hey,”</i> as it is written ([<i>Isa</i>. 26:4](https://www.chabad.org/15957#v4)): “for in Yah (<b>יָהּ</b>), the Lord, is the Rock of eternity.” With these two letters [<i>“yud”</i> and <i>“hey”</i>] of the Name, He fashioned two worlds, and it teaches you here that this world was created with a <i>“hey”</i> (<i>Men</i>. 29b).

</blockquote>

n2:4] <b>ה’ אֱלֹהִ֖ים</b> &mdash; <i><b>HaShem</b> God</i>. This is the first mention of the Four-letter Name <b>י־ה־ו־ה</b>, which denotes G-d in His Attribute of Mercy. At first G-d created the world with the attribute of Justice... The Name <b>י־ה־ו־ה</b> also signifies the eternity of G-d, because it letters contine the words <b>הָיָה הֹוֵה וְיִהְיֵה</b>, <i>He was, is and will be</i>. G-d "is the very first and the very last" (_Rambam_). Everything in the created universe must have had a moment when it came into existence, but G-d is infinite. He transcends time, thus the four-letter Name is often translated the Eternal One. This is the proper Name of G-d. It is not pronounced as it is spelled, but is pronounced _Adonai_. Otherwise it is referred to as **HaShem** or the Name.

n2:5] <b>כִּי֩ לֹ֨א הִמְטִ֜יר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ</b> &mdash;<i>For <b>HaShem</b> God had not yet sent rain upon the earth</i> because <i>there was no man to work the soil</i>. This demonstrates a basic article of faith: G-d provides what Man needs, but it is up to Man to pray and otherwise carry out his spiritual responsibilities.

<b>וייצר</b> &mdash; <i>formed.</i> Hints at two creations, a creation for this world and a creation for ... (<i>Rashi</i>)

<b>ויפח באפיו</b> &mdash; <i>and He breathed into his nostrils.</i> He made him of earthly matter and of heavenly matter: the body of earthly matter the soul of heavenly matter. Because on the first day, heaven and earth were created. On the second day, He created the expanse for the heavenly beings; on the third day He commanded the dry land to appear for the earthly beings; on the fourth day, He created luminaries for the heavenly beings; on the fifth day, He commanded the swarms of the waters to appear for the earthly beings; on the sixth day, it became necessary to create for both the heavenly and the earthly beings...

The soul made Man a living being, which _Onkelos_ defines as a _speaking spirit_. Accordingly, the gift from G-d that is unique to Man that He "blew" into Him is the soul that includes the power of intelligent speech. This is what separates (elevates) Man above the animal: the ability, and therefore the responsibility **to use his intelligence in G-d's service**.

</blockquote>

n2:9] <b>וְעֵ֕ץ הַדַּ֖עַת ט֥וֹב וָרָֽע</b> &mdash; <i>the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.</i> As Adam and Chava were originally created, their natural impulse was to do good. Although they knew in abstract that there was such a thing as sin, it was not something they craved. By eating of the tree, which embodied a _mixture_ of good and evil &mdash; hence its name &mdas; they brought evil into themselves and made it a part of their nature, thus changing the nature of Man. From then on, Man was born with evil impulses, such as greed, selfishness, and lust for whatever suits his developing appetite. Through study, though and self-discipline, he must curb his base nature and desires, and inculculate into himself a desire for good and a revulsion for evil (_Nefesh HaChaim_).

_Sforno_ claims it refers to Man's unwholesome capacity to choose what is superficiallly sweet [_good_] even though it is harmful to him, and to reject what is superficially bitter [_bad_] even when it is truly beneficial.

</article>

n2:18-25]<b>A companion for Adam.</b> Adam named her _Ishah_ [Woman], because she was taken from _Ish_ [Man] (v.23); left unanswered is why Man is called _Ish_. The name comes from _eish_ or fire [**אישׁ** ּ= **אשׁ**] because Mna is unique in the characteristics symbolised by fire: verve and enthusiasm, lust and initiative. These characteristics enable Man to attain wisdom and develop culture. But the same fire can cause the mass destructure that has marrred humanity from the beginning of time. Controlled and directed, that fire can create spiritual kingdoms that surpass the angels.

The presence of G-dliness in human beings is expressed by the letters that are added to their names: a **י** in the name **אישׁ** and a **ה** in the name **אשׁה**. The two letters spell the Divine Name **יה** &mdash; because G-d must be present in the union of Man and Woman. If they allow Him in, their union will be G-dly; if not, they are left with **אשׁ**, a destructive _fire_, that will not only harm their relationship, but may well unleash a conflagration around them.

<b>אזר כנגדו</b> &mdash; <i>A helper corresponding to him</i> [lit. _a helper against him"_] If he is worthy, she will be a helper, if not, she will be against him" ( _Gen. Rabbah_ 17:3; _Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer_, ch 12; _Yevamot_ 63a; _Rashi_).

They content that those who convey and interret the Law of G-d are motivated by a sselfish desire to consolidate power for themselves.

The tempter did not explicitly tell the woman to eat the fruitk but he had enveloped he in his spell. She looked on the tree with a new longing &mdash; its fruit was good to eat, a delight to the eyes, and it would give her wisdom.

<b>קמ”ו פסוקים, אמצי”ה סימן. יחוקיה”ו סימן</b> There are 146 verses in the _Sidrah_, numberically corresponding to [the names of the two kings Judah,] ...

<b>NOTES</b>

[^1]: Was it "exile"? They were already "exiled" from heaven to be place in Eden. Perhaps it was the change of realm, from that of Eden to that of Israel.
[^2]: Jews: If we define Jews as the nation that "dedicate ... G-d", then our definition is based not on "inheritence" but on action and dedication of energy for G-d.
[^4]: <b>וַיַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים בֵּ֥ין הָא֖וֹר וּבֵ֥ין הַחֽשֶׁךְ</b> &mdash; G-d seperated or differentiated between light and dark, and He named the light 'day' and dark 'night' (v5).
[^5]: If the angels were only created on the second day, who were the _Elohim_?
[^6]: _Decreed boundaries:_ This speaks to the principle that in order to make "space" for something else to exist, one has to create boundaries to constrain whatever (phenomenon) is there. Just as the people of Canaan had to be "constrained", i.e. removed, to make space for Israel to exist.

_Enough:_ Could be: Who (He) that says to His world, "Enough!". This brings in the interesting discussion in the Zohar between what the **מי** and the **מה** are.
[^7]: This supports the principle that everything (living) on earth wants to expand (procreate), to fulfil His desire.
[^8]:
[^9]: This is interesting in these times, with birth rate declining, and less and less people having kids. This is the one of the first (and thus fundamental) commandments given. If we stop procreating, we will die out. Just as one can judge the health of a forest by the amount of young trees it has growing in it at any stage, so we can judge the health of our human society in the same way. If our societies are not built on creating a better life for the future - our children - what then is its purpose?
[^10]: You have dominion over all the animals - if you prove yourself worthy, otherwise the animals (i.e., your beastly nature) will have dominion over you!
[^11]: This speaks of a certain template, containing both masculine and feminine. For the continuation of life, will require union between these two polarities, the harmony of which will produce the Divine Soul, able to have a relationship with the Divine.

In the same way that the supernal light contains both light and dark. In the creation this light is split asunder (the dark comes out of the light/the light that comes from the darkness), and it is necessary to unify the two to enable the Divine plan to come to fruition.
[^12]: This is the "commandment" regarding the template. It is a spiritual (and biological) imperative.

"replenish the earth": This you do by "obeying G-d's commandments" [And if you do these things...]

"and subdue it": One the "earth" has been subdued, the next phase of evolution will heralded. The only way to "subdue" the earth, is to subdue the "earthly" aspects of your own being, and then the _Shekhina_ will return from exile, and the Divine Presence will be felt all over the earth.
[^13]: This first speaks of all the herbs and fruits that were given for food.
[^14]: This is the next level. The green herbs and fruit are their food too. There is nothing about the animals or fish as food. Could it be that "they have every green herb to eat?"

Everything which has a living spirit comes under our domain - to use or abuse.
[^15]: If your wife is not your soul-mate, would this still be the case?
[^16]: I believe that it is necessary to explore one's personal desires, as this is what makes everyone special. These desires too are gifted to us from G-d, and if everyone sublimated them to His Desire, then what would G-d Himself be learning or discovering by that?
[^17]: None of the commentatators express the idea that the skin that He dressed Adam and Chava in were the actual skins that we wear today.
[^18]: It is always at your side, everpresent.
