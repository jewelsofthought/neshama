>**Locusts**: Locusts in Hebrew are _arbeh_, which means destruction, but the letters are similar to _harbeh_, which means abundance or bounty.

When looking at our lives, do we focus on the negative instead of the positive? Do we focus on our challenges or difficulties? From _arbeh_, we can choose to see the good and adjust our attitudes, to reframe and see the abundance and bounty. It is almost by beginning with the _heh_, or 'h', which represents G-d, knowing that all extends from His Mercy, we can adjust our attitude, and bring much into the place where there is little.
