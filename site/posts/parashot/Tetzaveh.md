## Tetzaveh

### In depth

The word _tetzaveh_, “you shall command,” also means “you shall connect” and “you shall bond.”

_That they bring to you pure olive oil . . . to raise an everlasting lamp . . . from evening to morning (27:20–21)_

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    For such is our mission in life: to impart the eternity and perfection of the Divine to a temporal world, and to do so not by annihilating or overwhelming the world’s temporality and diversity, but by illuminating its every state and condition&mdash;from “evening” to “morning”&mdash;with the divine light.

_Pure olive oil, crushed for the light (27:20)_

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    Just as the olive yields light only when it is pounded, so are man’s greatest potentials realized only under the pressure of adversity.

### Notes

28:30] Placement of _Urim_ and _Tumim_ **into** breastplate, upon Aaron's heart.

28:17-20] Names of stones: _odem_, _pitoah_, _barekes_, _nophech_, _sapir_, _yahalom_, _tarshish_, _shoham_, _yashfeh_.

28:6-10] Is the order same as on the two _shoham_
stones, by birth?

29:6-7] First place the turban on his head, then anoint him with oil?

29:21] Sprinkle blood and oil on the vestments... would that not soil them? Yet instead, it makes the clothes holy?

29:25-26] "You shall wave them, as a waving before HaShem". Interesting choice - what are they waving&mdash; not the people! It might be similar to the waving we do at the football matches.

29:35] 7 days of inauguration; twice a day. That would require $$14 * 3 = 42$$ sets of vestments or some subset of that.

30:7] Here we have the mysterious spice-incense.

n28:30] _Urim_ from אור (light); while _Tumim_ (plus the ineffable name) and anointing oil, light up with letters, which if read correctly...

n28:2] _Glory_ accrues to a person even because of God-given abilities, while _splendour_ refers to the regard he has earned through his own accomplishments.

n28:33] Pomegranates: 72 bells, 72 pomegranates => 72 shades of white (מצורה metzora)

n28:41] ומלאת את ידם - inaugurate, as in "fill hands" as opposed to empty-handed. Fill position, invested with authority - as in full hands.
