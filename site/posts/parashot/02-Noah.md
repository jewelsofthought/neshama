## Introduction

<div class="note">
Note: The first <i>parasha Bereishit</i> starts off with the universe in <i>tohu v'bohu</i>, darkness and confusion. The second, Noah also starts off with darkness (corruption) and confusion (robbery). The first is the story of the creation, the beginning of the Universe. The second is about the "creation" of mankind, their beginning. In both their is a progenirator. In the first, it is Adam, who then sins, and as a result, the first thing he does is cover his nakedness, and expelled from the Garden of Eden.

In the second, Noah, who is righteous, upon emerging from the flood sins by getting drunk and exposing his nakedness. He too was expelled, though in this case the "garden" was removed from him previously &mdash; by the flood. Imagine everyone on the planet getting annihilated, and you were the only person (you knew) who survived. Everything that had come before, all your friends, the society that evolved around you, everything had been denuded and you had to begin again alone (with only your family &mdash; which at that point consisted of your wife (who is never mentioned, and your sons (three of them) and their wives.) That is the "garden" to which I refer.
</div>

## Chapter 6

### 6:9] Righteous man. [^1]

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
ט אֵ֚לֶּה תּֽוֹלְדֹ֣ת נֹ֔חַ נֹ֗חַ אִ֥ישׁ צַדִּ֛יק תָּמִ֥ים הָיָ֖ה בְּדֹֽרֹתָ֑יו אֶת־הָֽאֱלֹהִ֖ים הִתְהַלֶּךְ־נֹֽחַ:
</p>
<p>
9. These are the generations of Noah, Noah was a righteous man he was perfect in his generations; Noah walked with God.
</p>
</blockquote>

n6:9] <b>נֹ֗חַ אִ֥ישׁ צַדִּ֛יק</b> &mdash; <i>Noah was a righteous man.</i> The primary "offspring" of the righteous are they good deeds, for the worthwhile things that a person does are his prime legacy. (_Rashi_) A person should work hard to perfect his deeds, just as he spares no effort to help his children (_R' Moshe Feinstein_)

<b>בְּדֹֽרֹתָ֑יו</b> &mdash; <i>In his generations.</i> There are two ways to look at this statement. The first is that it is in praise of Noah, who was righteous even while his generation was corrupt.[^2] How much more righteous would he have been had he been surrounded by righteous people.[^3]

The second is more critical of him, claiming that he was righteous only _in_ **his** _generation_, by comparison to his wicked brothers (_Rashi_). Accordingly, the righteous of each generation are judged in terms of their own time (_Sefer HaParshiyot_).

### 6:11-13] Corrupt(ion) (תשׁחת) & Robbery (חָמָס)

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  יא וַתִּשָּׁחֵ֥ת הָאָ֖רֶץ לִפְנֵ֣י הָֽאֱלֹהִ֑ים וַתִּמָּלֵ֥א הָאָ֖רֶץ חָמָֽס:
  יב וַיַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֶת־הָאָ֖רֶץ וְהִנֵּ֣ה נִשְׁחָ֑תָה כִּֽי־הִשְׁחִ֧ית כָּל־בָּשָׂ֛ר אֶת־דַּרְכּ֖וֹ עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ:
  יג וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֜ים לְנֹ֗חַ קֵ֤ץ כָּל־בָּשָׂר֙ בָּ֣א לְפָנַ֔י כִּי־מָֽלְאָ֥ה הָאָ֛רֶץ חָמָ֖ס מִפְּנֵיהֶ֑ם וְהִנְנִ֥י מַשְׁחִיתָ֖ם אֶת־הָאָֽרֶץ:
</p>
<p>
11. Now the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth became full of robbery.
12. And God saw the earth, and behold it had become corrupted, for all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth.
13. And God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth has become full of robbery because of them, and behold I am destroying them from the earth.
</p>
</blockquote>

n6:11-12] The behaviour of the people had deteriorated. At first they were _corrupt_ &mdash; being guilty of immorality and idolatry. They sinned covertly (_before_ G-d). Later, _the earth had become filled with robbery_. This robbery was obvious to all.[^4]

Then the entire earth _was corrupted_, because Man is the essence of the world, and his corruption infects all of Creation (_Zohar_). Such is the progression of sin. It begins in private, when people still have a sense of right and wrong. But once people develop the habit of sinning, they gradually lose their shame, and immoral behaviour becomes accepted &mdash; even the required &mdash; norm.[^5]

The Midrash teaches that they stole from one another in petty ways that were not subject to the authority of the courts.[^6] Though this is not the gravest kind of sin, it is morally damaging in the extreme, because thievery within the letter of the law weakens the conscience and corrupts the fabric[^7] (_R. Hirsch_).

### 6:13] Flood because of Robbery

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  יג וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֜ים לְנֹ֗חַ קֵ֤ץ כָּל־בָּשָׂר֙ בָּ֣א לְפָנַ֔י כִּי־מָֽלְאָ֥ה הָאָ֛רֶץ חָמָ֖ס מִפְּנֵיהֶ֑ם וְהִנְנִ֥י מַשְׁחִיתָ֖ם אֶת־הָאָֽרֶץ:
</p>
<p>
13. And God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth has become full of robbery [^8] because of them, and behold I am destroying them from the earth.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  טווְזֶ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֹתָ֑הּ שְׁל֧שׁ מֵא֣וֹת אַמָּ֗ה אֹ֚רֶךְ הַתֵּבָ֔ה חֲמִשִּׁ֤ים אַמָּה֙ רָחְבָּ֔הּ וּשְׁלשִׁ֥ים אַמָּ֖ה קֽוֹמָתָֽהּ:
</p>
<p>
15. And this [is the size] you shall make it: three hundred cubits the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height.</p>
</blockquote>

n6:15] **Cubit**.[^9] According the to smallest estimate of 18 inches per cubit, the dimensions of the Art were 450 x 75 x 45 feet = 1,518,750 cubic feet. Each of its three stories had 33,750 sq. feet of floor space for a total of 101,250 sq. feet.

### 6:16] Window on the Ark

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  טז צֹ֣הַר תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֣ה לַתֵּבָ֗ה וְאֶל־אַמָּה֙ תְּכַלֶּ֣נָּה מִלְמַ֔עְלָה וּפֶ֥תַח הַתֵּבָ֖ה בְּצִדָּ֣הּ תָּשִׂ֑ים תַּחְתִּיִּ֛ם שְׁנִיִּ֥ם וּשְׁלִשִׁ֖ים תַּֽעֲשֶֽׂהָ:
</p>
<p>
16. You shall make a skylight for the ark, and to a cubit you shall finish it to the top, and the entrance of the ark you shall place in its side; you shall make it with bottom [compartments], second story [compartments], and third story [compartments].
</p>
</blockquote>

n6:16] <b>צֹ֣הַר</b> &mdash; <i>A window.</i> Some say it was a skylight&mdash; most say it was a window, and some say it was a precious stone that refracted the outside light to illuminate the interior.[^10] (_Chizkuni_)

### 6:17] Flood - all will perish[^11]

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  יז וַֽאֲנִ֗י הִֽנְנִי֩ מֵבִ֨יא אֶת־הַמַּבּ֥וּל מַ֨יִם֙ עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ לְשַׁחֵ֣ת כָּל־בָּשָׂ֗ר אֲשֶׁר־בּוֹ֙ ר֣וּחַ חַיִּ֔ים מִתַּ֖חַת הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם כֹּ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָ֖רֶץ יִגְוָֽע:
</p>
<p>
17. And I, behold I am bringing the flood, water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which there is the spirit of life, from beneath the heavens; all that is upon the earth will perish.
</p>
</blockquote>

### 6:18] Covenant

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
</p>
יח וַֽהֲקִֽמֹתִ֥י אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֖י אִתָּ֑ךְ וּבָאתָ֙ אֶל־הַתֵּ֔בָה אַתָּ֕ה וּבָנֶי֛ךָ וְאִשְׁתְּךָ֥ וּנְשֵֽׁי־בָנֶי֖ךָ אִתָּֽךְ:
<p>
18. And I will set up My covenant with you, and you shall enter the ark, you and your sons, and your wife and your sons' wives with you.
</p>
</blockquote>

n6:18] <b>וַֽהֲקִֽמֹתִ֥י אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֖י</b> &mdash; <i>I will set up My covenant with you.[^12]</i>

### 6:19] The Ark was too small

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
 יט וּמִכָּל־הָ֠חַ֠י מִכָּל־בָּשָׂ֞ר שְׁנַ֧יִם מִכֹּ֛ל תָּבִ֥יא אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֖ה לְהַֽחֲיֹ֣ת אִתָּ֑ךְ זָכָ֥ר וּנְקֵבָ֖ה יִֽהְיֽוּ:
</p>
<p>
19. And of all living things of all flesh, two of each you shall bring into the ark to preserve alive with you; they shall be male and female.[^13]
</p>
</blockquote>

## Chapter 7

### 7:1] Righteous (2x)

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  א וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ לְנֹ֔חַ בֹּֽא־אַתָּ֥ה וְכָל־בֵּֽיתְךָ֖ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֑ה כִּי־אֹֽתְךָ֥ רָאִ֛יתִי צַדִּ֥יק לְפָנַ֖י בַּדּ֥וֹר הַזֶּֽה:
</p>
<p>
1. And the Lord said to Noah, "Come into the ark, you and all your household, for it is you that I have seen as a righteous man before Me in this generation.[^14]
</p>
</blockquote>

n1-10] Up to now, the _Sidrah_ has spoken of _Elohim_, indicating G-d's Attribute of Justice. Here he is called **HaShem**, the G-d of Mercy. _Sforno_ thinks that this is because He is saving Noah from the flood, which they did not deserve.

### 7:2] Clean animals

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  ב מִכֹּ֣ל | הַבְּהֵמָ֣ה הַטְּהוֹרָ֗ה תִּקַּח־לְךָ֛ שִׁבְעָ֥ה שִׁבְעָ֖ה אִ֣ישׁ וְאִשְׁתּ֑וֹ וּמִן־הַבְּהֵמָ֡ה אֲ֠שֶׁ֠ר לֹ֣א טְהֹרָ֥ה הִ֛וא שְׁנַ֖יִם אִ֥ישׁ וְאִשְׁתּֽוֹ:
</p>
<p>
2O. Of all the clean animals you shall take for yourself seven pairs, a male and its mate, and of the animals that are not clean, two, a male and its mate.[^15]
</p>
</blockquote>

### 7:4] Flood - Blot out all beings

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  ד כִּי֩ לְיָמִ֨ים ע֜וֹד שִׁבְעָ֗ה אָֽנֹכִי֙ מַמְטִ֣יר עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ אַרְבָּעִ֣ים י֔וֹם וְאַרְבָּעִ֖ים לָ֑יְלָה וּמָחִ֗יתִי אֶת־כָּל־הַיְקוּם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשִׂ֔יתִי מֵעַ֖ל פְּנֵ֥י הָֽאֲדָמָֽה:
</p>
<p>
4.For in another seven days, I will make it rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will blot out all beings that I have made, off the face of the earth."[^16]
</p>
</blockquote>

### 7:6] 600 years old

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  ווְנֹ֕חַ בֶּן־שֵׁ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וְהַמַּבּ֣וּל הָיָ֔ה מַ֖יִם עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ:
</p>
<p>
6. And Noah was six hundred years old, and the flood came about, water upon the earth.[^17]
</p>
</blockquote>

### 7:7] Sexual relations

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  ז וַיָּבֹ֣א נֹ֔חַ וּ֠בָנָ֠יו וְאִשְׁתּ֧וֹ וּנְשֵֽׁי־בָנָ֛יו אִתּ֖וֹ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֑ה מִפְּנֵ֖י מֵ֥י הַמַּבּֽוּל:
</p>
<p>
7. And Noah with his sons, his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark because of the flood waters.
</p>
</blockquote>

n7:7] <b>נֹ֔חַ וּ֠בָנָ֠יו</b> &mdash; <i>Noah and his sons.</i> The men and women are listed separately because marital intimacy was forbidden at a time when the whole world was steeped in pain (_Rashi_).[^18]

<b>מִפְּנֵ֖י מֵ֥י הַמַּבּֽוּל</b> &mdash; <i>Because of the waters of the flood.</i>The implication being Noah, too, was of those who had little faith, believing and not believing that the Flood would come, and he did not enter the ark until the waters forced him to do so. — [_Gen. Rabbah_ 32:6]\(_Rashi_)... **Man should not allow his calculations to stand in the way of his compliance with G-d's command** (_Me'am Loez_).[^19]

### 7:8] Clean beasts

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  ח מִן־הַבְּהֵמָה֙ הַטְּהוֹרָ֔ה וּמִ֨ן־הַבְּהֵמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵינֶ֖נָּה טְהֹרָ֑ה וּמִ֨ן־הָע֔וֹף וְכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־רֹמֵ֖שׂ עַל־
</p>
<p>
8O. Of the clean beasts and of the beasts that are not clean, and of the fowl, and all that creeps upon the earth.
</p>
</blockquote>

n7:8] <b>אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵינֶ֖נָּה טְהֹרָ֑ה</b> &mdash; <i>That is not clean.</i> By using this long expression instead of the single word <b>הַטְמֵאָה</b>, _unclean_, the Torah teaches a moral lesson: **One should never utter a gross expression**, for the Torah, which stresses brevity, added several letters to the Hebrew text of our verse to avoid using the unseemly expression _unclean_ (_Pesachim_ 3a).

### 7:9] Two-by-Two they came

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  ט שְׁנַ֨יִם שְׁנַ֜יִם בָּ֧אוּ אֶל־נֹ֛חַ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֖ה זָכָ֣ר וּנְקֵבָ֑ה כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֛ר צִוָּ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־נֹֽחַ:
</p>
<p>
9. Two by two they came to Noah to the ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.
</p>
</blockquote>

n7:9] The unclean animals came to the Ark of their own free will, whereas the clean animals Noah had to go seek out. For G-d to have sent those animals to Noah without any effort on his part would have diminished the significance of his offerings. A person's free-willed offering is an expression of his gratitude or an effort to increase his closeness to ... G-d.[^19a] **It is his _own_ desire and his _own_ exertions that give value to his offering.**[^20]

### 7:11] Fountains and windows

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  יא בִּשְׁנַ֨ת שֵֽׁשׁ־מֵא֤וֹת שָׁנָה֙ לְחַיֵּי־נֹ֔חַ בַּחֹ֨דֶשׁ֙ הַשֵּׁנִ֔י בְּשִׁבְעָֽה־עָשָׂ֥ר י֖וֹם לַחֹ֑דֶשׁ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֗ה נִבְקְעוּ֙ כָּל־מַעְיְנוֹת֙ תְּה֣וֹם רַבָּ֔ה וַֽאֲרֻבֹּ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם נִפְתָּֽחוּ
</p>
<p>
11. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on this day, all the fountains of the great deep were split,[^21] and the windows of the heavens opened up.
</p>
</blockquote>

n7:11] <b> וַֽאֲרֻבֹּ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם </b> &mdash; <i>split the fountains of the great deep and the windows of heaven opened up.</i>

### 7:13-15] Gathering into the Ark

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  טו וַיָּבֹ֥אוּ אֶל־נֹ֖חַ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֑ה שְׁנַ֤יִם שְׁנַ֨יִם֙ מִכָּל־הַבָּשָׂ֔ר אֲשֶׁר־בּ֖וֹ ר֥וּחַ חַיִּֽים:
</p>
<p>
15. And they came to Noah to the ark, two by two of all flesh in which there is the spirit of life.[^22]
</p>
</blockquote>

n7:15] Here we find Man in his loftiest state, for the entire world comes _to Noah_. (_R' Hirsch_). The verse stresses that they came in matched pairs, and not one species was missing &mdash; which was a miracle! (_Ibn Caspi_)... Such precision what have been impossible by natural (non-Divine) means. (_R' Bachya_)

### 7:16] **HaShem** closed the Ark

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  טז וְהַבָּאִ֗ים זָכָ֨ר וּנְקֵבָ֤ה מִכָּל־בָּשָׂר֙ בָּ֔אוּ כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֛ר צִוָּ֥ה אֹת֖וֹ אֱלֹהִ֑ים וַיִּסְגֹּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה בַּֽעֲדֽוֹ:
</p>
<p>
16. And those who came male and female of all flesh came, as God had commanded him, and the Lord shut it on his behalf.[^23]
</p>
</blockquote>

n7:16] <b>וַיִּסְגֹּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה בַּֽעֲדֽוֹ</b> &mdash; <i>The door was shut by the Lord for him.</i>

### 7:17-24] A description of the flood[^24]

#### 7:21-23] Flesh expired, not vegetation[^25]

## Chapter 8

### 8:1] Spirit (רוח) passes over the waters

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  א וַיִּזְכֹּ֤ר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת־נֹ֔חַ וְאֵ֤ת כָּל־הַֽחַיָּה֙ וְאֶת־כָּל־הַבְּהֵמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אִתּ֖וֹ בַּתֵּבָ֑ה וַיַּֽעֲבֵ֨ר אֱלֹהִ֥ים ר֨וּחַ֙ עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ וַיָּשֹׁ֖כּוּ הַמָּֽיִם:
  ב וַיִּסָּֽכְרוּ֙ מַעְיְנֹ֣ת תְּה֔וֹם וַֽאֲרֻבֹּ֖ת הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם וַיִּכָּלֵ֥א הַגֶּ֖שֶׁם מִן־הַשָּׁמָֽיִם:
</p>
<p>
1. And God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark, and God caused a spirit to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.
2. And the springs of the deep were closed, and the windows of the heavens, and the rain from the heavens was withheld.
</p>
</blockquote>

n8:1] <b>וַיִּזְכֹּ֤ר אֱלֹהִים֙</b> &mdash; <i>G-d remembered.</i> To say G-d "remembers" implies that forgetfulness, {or lack of awareness,} is possible for Him, which is clearly an absurdity... Noah earned this mercy because he fed and cared for the animals during all the months in the Ark (_Midrash_).[^26]

<b>ר֨וּחַ֙</b> &mdash; <i>A spirit.[^27]</i> This _spirit_ or _wind_ caused the waters to stop their seething, boiling fury and (v8:2) sealed the sources of the waters so that they could begin to recede.[^28]

### 8:3-4] Diminished after 150 days

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  גוַיָּשֻׁ֧בוּ הַמַּ֛יִם מֵעַ֥ל הָאָ֖רֶץ הָל֣וֹךְ וָשׁ֑וֹב וַיַּחְסְר֣וּ הַמַּ֔יִם מִקְצֵ֕ה חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים וּמְאַ֖ת יֽוֹם:
</p>
<p>
3. And the waters receded off the earth more and more, and the water diminished at the end of a hundred and fifty days.
</p>
</blockquote>

n3-6] On the first of Sivan &mdash; the seventh month and 150 days from 27 Kislev when the rain ended &mdash; the water began to recede, and on the 17th of Sivan, the bottom of the Ark rested on the mountains of Ararat. It was not until the 10th month from the _beginning_ of the rain that the mountaintops became visible. Forty days after that, Noah opened the window of the Ark.[^29]

### 8:7] The Raven

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  זוַיְשַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־הָֽעֹרֵ֑ב וַיֵּצֵ֤א יָצוֹא֙ וָשׁ֔וֹב עַד־יְב֥שֶׁת הַמַּ֖יִם מֵעַ֥ל הָאָֽרֶץ:
</p>
<p>
7. And he sent forth the raven, and it went out, back and forth until the waters dried up off the earth.[^30]
</p>
</blockquote>

### 8:8-12] The Dove

8. And he sent forth the dove from with him, to see whether the waters had abated from upon the surface of the earth.
9. But the dove found no resting place for the sole of its foot; so it returned to him to the ark because there was water upon the entire surface of the earth; so he stretched forth his hand and took it, and he brought it to him to the ark.
10. And he waited again another seven days, and he again sent forth the dove from the ark.
11. And the dove returned to him at eventide, and behold it had plucked an olive leaf in its mouth; so Noah knew that the water had abated from upon the earth.
12. And he again waited another seven days, and he sent forth the dove, and it no longer continued to return to him.[^31]</p>
</p>
</blockquote>

n8:11] <b>וַתָּבֹ֨א אֵלָ֤יו הַיּוֹנָה֙</b> &mdash; <i>The dove came back to him.</i> The Torah implies that the dove came back to Noah in fulfillment of its mission to bring back a sign of G-d's response (<i>Haamek Davar</i>). By bringing back an olive leaf, the was saying symbolically, "Better that my food be bitter but from G-d's hand, than sweet as honey but dependent on mortal Man" (<i>Rashi</i>). R' Hirsch elaborates: For a full year the dove could not find its own food to eat; hunger forced it to rely on Noah's kindness. The it found a bitter leaf that it would ordinarily not eat &mdash; and carried it back to Noah. The lesson that the Sages teach from this is that <b>even the bitterest food eaten in freedom is better than the sweetest food given in servitude</b>.

### 8:13-14] Waters dried

n8:14] From 17th Marchesvan, when the rains began, to the 27th Marchesvan of the following year, when Noah was finally able to leave the Ark, was a full solar year, making 365 days that the earth was inhabitable.[^32]

### 8:16] Leave the Ark

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  טזצֵ֖א מִן־הַתֵּבָ֑ה אַתָּ֕ה וְאִשְׁתְּךָ֛ וּבָנֶ֥יךָ וּנְשֵֽׁי־בָנֶ֖יךָ אִתָּֽךְ:
</p>
<p>
16. Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.
</p>
</blockquote>

n16] <b>The command to leave the Ark.</b> In telling Noah to leave the Ark, G-d uses the name _Elohim_, and uses it throughout the narrative. In addition to its familiar connotation of G-d as Judge, it also refers to Him as G-d Who dominates nature and uses it to carry out His ends. Just as judgement proceeds accordingly to clearly defined rules, so too nature has clearly defined laws, within which G-d guides the world. The Name _Elohim_ refers to this aspect of G-d's total mastery, for it describes Him as "the Mighty One Who wields authority over the beings above and below" (_Tur Orach Chaim_ 5) and the בעל היכולת, _the Omnipotent One_ (_Shulchan Aruch_, ibid). Note that the numerical value of _Elohim_ equals that of הטבע, _the nature_, indicating that He controls all natural phenomenon.[^33]

### 8:20-21] Alter for sacrifice

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  כ וַיִּ֥בֶן נֹ֛חַ מִזְבֵּ֖חַ לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה וַיִּקַּ֞ח מִכֹּ֣ל הַבְּהֵמָ֣ה הַטְּהֹרָ֗ה וּמִכֹּל֙ הָע֣וֹף הַטָּה֔וֹר וַיַּ֥עַל עֹלֹ֖ת בַּמִּזְבֵּֽחַ:
  כא וַיָּ֣רַח יְהֹוָה֘ אֶת־רֵ֣יחַ הַנִּיחֹ֒חַ֒ וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־לִבּ֗וֹ לֹ֣א אֹ֠סִ֠ף לְקַלֵּ֨ל ע֤וֹד אֶת־הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽעֲב֣וּר הָֽאָדָ֔ם כִּ֠י יֵ֣צֶר לֵ֧ב הָֽאָדָ֛ם רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו וְלֹֽא־אֹסִ֥ף ע֛וֹד לְהַכּ֥וֹת אֶת־כָּל־חַ֖י כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשִֽׂיתִי:
</p>
<p>
21. And the Lord smelled the pleasant aroma, and the Lord said to Himself, "I will no longer curse the earth because of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, and I will no longer smite all living things as I have done.
20. And Noah built an altar to the Lord, and he took of all the clean animals and of all the clean fowl and brought up burnt offerings on the altar.
</p>
</blockquote>

n8:20] **Noah brings an offering.** In connection with the sacrifices, G-d is always called **HaShem**, the Name signifying the attribute of Mercy. This shows that offering are always directed toward the Merciful G-d Who desires _life_, not death and suffering. The purpose of the sacrificial service is to bring about a person's closeness and dedication to G-dliness. The non-Jewish, blasphemous view of sacrifices as an appeasment of a "vengeful God of nature.

n8:21] <b>רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו</b> &mdash; <i>Is evil from his youth.[^34]</i> Man receives the evil inclination from birth before he has the wisdom and maturity to combat it. [Meaning that **man's animal instincts are inborn, while the intelect and spiritual desire for self-improvement must be inculcated and developed with time and maturity**].

## Chapter 9

### 9:2] Fear you

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  ב וּמוֹרַֽאֲכֶ֤ם וְחִתְּכֶם֙ יִֽהְיֶ֔ה עַ֚ל כָּל־חַיַּ֣ת הָאָ֔רֶץ וְעַ֖ל כָּל־ע֣וֹף הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם בְּכֹל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר תִּרְמֹ֧שׂ הָֽאֲדָמָ֛ה וּבְכָל־דְּגֵ֥י הַיָּ֖ם בְּיֶדְכֶ֥ם נִתָּֽנוּ:
</p>
<p>
2. And your fear and your dread shall be upon all the beasts of the earth and upon all the fowl of the heaven; upon everything that creeps upon the ground and upon all the fish of the sea, [for] they have been given into your hand[s].
</p>
</blockquote>

n9:2] <b>וּמוֹרַֽאֲכֶ֤ם</b> &mdash; <i>The fear of you.</i> Lest Noah be afraid that the few surviving people would be in constant danger from the hordes of animals in the world, G-d ... had implanted in animals and instinctive fear of human beings (_Arbabanel_).[^35]

### 9:3] Meat allowed

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  גכָּל־רֶ֨מֶשׂ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הוּא־חַ֔י לָכֶ֥ם יִֽהְיֶ֖ה לְאָכְלָ֑ה כְּיֶ֣רֶק עֵ֔שֶׂב נָתַ֥תִּי לָכֶ֖ם אֶת־כֹּֽל:
</p>
<p>
3. Every moving thing that lives shall be yours to eat; like the green vegetation, I have given you everything.[^36]
</p>
</blockquote>

### 9:4-5] No blood allowed

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  דאַךְ־בָּשָׂ֕ר בְּנַפְשׁ֥וֹ דָמ֖וֹ לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ:
  הוְאַ֨ךְ אֶת־דִּמְכֶ֤ם לְנַפְשֹֽׁתֵיכֶם֙ אֶדְר֔שׁ מִיַּ֥ד כָּל־חַיָּ֖ה אֶדְרְשֶׁ֑נּוּ וּמִיַּ֣ד הָֽאָדָ֗ם מִיַּד֙ אִ֣ישׁ אָחִ֔יו אֶדְר֖שׁ אֶת־נֶ֥פֶשׁ הָֽאָדָֽם:
</p>
<p>
4. But, flesh with its soul, its blood, you shall not eat.
5. But your blood, of your souls, I will demand [an account]; from the hand of every beast I will demand it, and from the hand of man, from the hand of each man, his brother, I will demand the soul of man.[^39]
</p>
</blockquote>

### 9:8-17] Rainbow[^40]

n9:8-17] That the rainbow is a phenomenon that is predictable and explainable in natural terms is no contradiction to its status as a Divinely ordained sign. God utilized the natural phenomena of His world as reminders of His covenant, for the very laws of nature should recall to thinking people that there is a G-d of nature.

### 9:18-19] Noah's sons[^41]

### 9:20] Noah: Man of the earth

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
 כוַיָּ֥חֶל נֹ֖חַ אִ֣ישׁ הָֽאֲדָמָ֑ה וַיִּטַּ֖ע כָּֽרֶם:
</p>
<p>
20. And Noah began to be a master of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.
</p>
</blockquote>

n9:20] <b>אִ֣ישׁ הָֽאֲדָמָ֑ה</b> &mdash; <i>Man of the Earth[^42]</i>

### 9:21] Noah drunk

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  כאוַיֵּ֥שְׁתְּ מִן־הַיַּ֖יִן וַיִּשְׁכָּ֑ר וַיִּתְגַּ֖ל בְּת֥וֹךְ אָֽהֳלֹֽה:
</p>
<p>
21. And he drank of the wine and became drunk, and he uncovered himself within his tent.[^43]
</p>
</blockquote>

### 9:22] Ham saw

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  כב וַיַּ֗רְא חָ֚ם אֲבִ֣י כְנַ֔עַן אֵ֖ת עֶרְוַ֣ת אָבִ֑יו וַיַּגֵּ֥ד לִשְׁנֵֽי־אֶחָ֖יו בַּחֽוּץ:
</p>
<p>
22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside.
</p>
</blockquote>

n9:22] <b>וַיַּ֗רְא חָ֚ם אֲבִ֣י כְנַ֔עַן</b> &mdash; <i>Ham, the father of Canaan, saw.[^44]</i> Basically his behaviour was disgraceful, for he entered the tent, and leered at Noah's debasement, then, instead of averting his gaze and covering him, he went derisively to tell his brothers.

</div>

### 9:23] Shem & Japhet did not see

Note: Why was it such a sin to gaze upon one's father's nakedness? Especially as a young boy. There is a subtle, and disturbing, line of sexual conduct between father and son here that bodes no good.

### 9:24] Noah awoke

Note: Noah awakens, and wanders what his "small" son had done to him. Now, how would Noah be aware of anything that occurred, if the son had just gazed upon him? So what did the boy actually do to him?

### 9:25-27] Curses Ham

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  כה וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אָר֣וּר כְּנָ֑עַן עֶ֥בֶד עֲבָדִ֖ים יִֽהְיֶ֥ה לְאֶחָֽיו:
  כו וַיֹּ֕אמֶר בָּר֥וּךְ יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹ֣הֵי שֵׁ֑ם וִיהִ֥י כְנַ֖עַן עֶ֥בֶד לָֽמוֹ:
  כז יַ֤פְתְּ אֱלֹהִים֙ לְיֶ֔פֶת וְיִשְׁכֹּ֖ן בְּאָֽהֳלֵי־שֵׁ֑ם וִיהִ֥י כְנַ֖עַן עֶ֥בֶד לָֽמוֹ:
</p>
<p>
25. And he said, "Cursed be Canaan; he shall be a slave among slaves to his brethren."
26. And he said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem, and may Canaan be a slave to them.
27. May God expand Japheth, and may He dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be a slave to them."[^45]
</p>
</blockquote>

n25] <b>עֶ֥בֶד עֲבָדִ֖ים</b> &mdash; <i>A slave of slaves.</i> The curse is that from birth the Canaanites will be steeped in the culture of slavery, and not seriously desire freedom. The descendents of Shem and Japheth, however, will have a nobler spirit; they will always crave freedom, even if they are enslaved (_Haamek Devar_).

## Chapter 10: The seventy nations

### 10:5] Separated into nations

![The Seventy Nations](/site/posts/img/parashot/the%2070%20nations.jpg)

5. From these, the islands of the nations separated in their lands, each one to his language, according to their families, in their nations.

</p>
<p>
9. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord."
</p>
</blockquote>

n8-10] <b>Nimrod.</b> Before Nimrod there were neither wars nor reigning monarchs. He subjugated the Babylonians, then he went to Assyria and build great cities (_Radak_; _Ramban_). The Torah calls him a _might hunter_, which most interpret figuratively. Nimrod ensnared men with his words and incited them to rebel against G-d. He we the forerunner of the hypocrite who drapes himself in robes of piety in order to deceive the masses (_R' Hirsch_)

### 10:31-32] According to their

32. These are the families of the sons of Noah according to their generations, in their nations, and from these, the nations were separated on the earth after the Flood.
</p>
</blockquote>

<section>

## Chapter 11: Babel

n1-9] <b>The Tower of Babel and the Dispersion.</b> The year of the following narrative is 1996 from Creation, 340 years after the flood. Noah and his children are still alive at this time. Abraham, 48 years old, had already recognised his Creator (_Seder Olam_). All the nation families were concentrated in present day Iraq [בבל] and they all spoke _one language_, the Holy Tongue (_Rashi_), the language with which the world was created (_Mizrachi_).

All the ingredients for greatness were there. The nations were united, they were in a central location, they spoke the Holy Tongue and &mdash; if they desire guidance in achieving holiness &mdash; they had Noah, Shem and Abraham amongst them. Instead, as so often happens in human history, they chose to ignore their spiritual advanatages and turn to their opportunities for self-aggrandizement and power. It seems ludicrous that people who had first-hand evidence of the Flood could have found grounds to rationalise a way of bypassing G-d's control of events, but such is man's capacity for self-deception that he can negate reality and build substance around a vacuum.[^46]

### 11:5] G-d descends

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  ה וַיֵּ֣רֶד יְהֹוָ֔ה לִרְאֹ֥ת אֶת־הָעִ֖יר וְאֶת־הַמִּגְדָּ֑ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר בָּנ֖וּ בְּנֵ֥י הָֽאָדָֽם:
</p>
<p>
5. And the Lord descended to see the city and the tower that the sons of man had built.
</p>
</blockquote>

n11:5] <b>וַיֵּ֣רֶד ה' ־</b> &mdash; <i><b>HaShem</b> descended.</i> This is an obvious anthropomophism [the figurative assignment of human characteristics to God]. When God wishes to examine the deeds of lowly Man, Scripture calls it _descent_. (_Radak_)

### 11:7] Let us descend

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  ז הָ֚בָה נֵֽרְדָ֔ה וְנָֽבְלָ֥ה שָׁ֖ם שְׂפָתָ֑ם אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹ֣א יִשְׁמְע֔וּ אִ֖ישׁ שְׂפַ֥ת רֵעֵֽהוּ:
</p>
<p>
7. Come, let us descend and confuse their language, so that one will not understand the language of his companion."
</p>
</blockquote>

n11:7] <b>הָ֚בָה נֵֽרְדָ֔ה</b> &mdash; <i>Let us descend.</i> The plural indicates that G-d deliberated with His Celestial Court (_Rashi_). G-d does not need the advice of the angels, but He consulted to set an example that people should show courtesy to others by involving them in discussions and that it is unwise for people to take decisions upon themselves without consulting others.

### 11:26-27] Terach, father of Abram

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
כו וַֽיְחִי־תֶ֖רַח שִׁבְעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֨וֹלֶד֙ אֶת־אַבְרָ֔ם אֶת־נָח֖וֹר וְאֶת־הָרָֽן:
כז וְאֵ֨לֶּה֙ תּֽוֹלְדֹ֣ת תֶּ֔רַח תֶּ֚רַח הוֹלִ֣יד אֶת־אַבְרָ֔ם אֶת־נָח֖וֹר וְאֶת־הָרָ֑ן וְהָרָ֖ן הוֹלִ֥יד אֶת־לֽוֹט
</p>
<p>
26. And Terach lived seventy years, and he begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
27. And these are the generations of Terach: Terach begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran begot Lot.
</p>
</blockquote>

n11:26] <b>Birth of Abraham.</b> In a real sense, Creation now begins anew. for it was Abraham who would bear the burden of holiness in the world. His name signified this. At first he was Abram, a contraction of <b>אַב אַרָם</b> _father [i.e., teacher] of Aram,_ for he began as a leader of his own nation, but ultimately he became a father of the whole world. {Note: This does not seem to be completely accurate. For his influence did not extend to the Far East. However, G-d's predication that he would become the father of a great and populous nation was true. [see 17:5] (_Rashi_).}

Abraham's mother was **Amatiai**, daughter of Karnebo.

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
כחוַיָּ֣מָת הָרָ֔ן עַל־פְּנֵ֖י תֶּ֣רַח אָבִ֑יו בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מֽוֹלַדְתּ֖וֹ בְּא֥וּר כַּשְׂדִּֽים:
</p>
<p>
28. And Haran died during the lifetime of Terah his father in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.
</p>
</blockquote>

n11:28] <b>עַל־פְּנֵ֖י תֶּ֣רַח אָבִ֑יו</b> &mdash; <i>during the lifetime of Terah his father.</i>Lit. on the face of Terah his father. During his father's lifetime (_Tan. Acharei_ 7). And the Midrash Aggadah (_Gen. Rabbah_ 38:13) tells us that he died on account of his father. For Terah complained about Abram his son before Nimrod for crushing his idols; so he [Nimrod] cast him [Abram] into a fiery furnace, and Haran sat and thought, "If Abram is victorious, I am on his side, and if Nimrod is victorious, I am on his side." When Abram was saved, they said to Haran, "Whose side are you on?" Haran said to them, "I am on Abram's side!" They cast him into the fiery furnace and he was burned. This is the meaning of **אוּר כַּשְׂדִּים**, the fire of the Chaldees. Menachem (_Machbereth_, p. 32), however, explains אוּר as a valley. Any hole or deep crevice is called **אוּר**.

### 11:29] Terach, father of Abram

<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl">
  כט וַיִּקַּ֨ח אַבְרָ֧ם וְנָח֛וֹר לָהֶ֖ם נָשִׁ֑ים שֵׁ֤ם אֵֽשֶׁת־אַבְרָם֙ שָׂרָ֔י וְשֵׁ֤ם אֵֽשֶׁת־נָחוֹר֙ מִלְכָּ֔ה בַּת־הָרָ֥ן אֲבִֽי־מִלְכָּ֖ה וַֽאֲבִ֥י יִסְכָּֽה:
</p>
<p>
29. And Abram and Nahor took themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.
</p>
</blockquote>

n11:29] <b>וַיִּקַּ֨ח אַבְרָ֧ם</b> &mdash; <i>And Abram ... took.</i> When Haran died, his brothers, Abram and Nakhor, married his daughters, Sarai and Milcah, to carry on his memory and to assuage Terah's grief. (_Imrei Shefer_)

</p>

[^1]: Noah is the only person in the Torah that is referred to as righteous. Yet, he promptly got drunk upon surviving the flood (perhaps his mind couldn't handle it. It is interesting the contradictions often. Jacob is know as Truth, yet he stole the birthright from His brother, and lied (deceived his father).
[^2]: Though if he lived for 600+ years, was that only one generation of people around him? Was the 600+ years of his life specific to Noah? This is pre-flood, so the earth was populated at that time.
[^3]: I question that, for is not a man righteous in his own right, and from his own internal impulses? That is, a <i>benoni</i> would be influenced by the corruption around him, where as a <i>tzadik</i> would not be influenced by the behaviour of those surrounding him.
[^4]: Does that mean that everyone participated in it. Then it would imply that it was not "obvious", as people were ignoring it. However, in the present situation today, it seems that even though robbery is rampant, it is certainly not <b>obvious</b> to all! In order for "robbery" to be obvious, there must have been people that were not "corrupt" in that fashion as to look at robbery as normal behaviour. At this stage of our evolution, a system of robbery (I like to refer to it as piracy) has emerged and is now rampant upon the earth.
[^5]: Is that why robbery is mentioned in the following paragraph. Because it starts with petty theft (Perhaps that is why some of the later laws regarding money and trade are introduced) and then progresses till it become grievous and the whole world becomes corrupt.
[^6]: **Courts:** That is assuming that we always had these judicial institutions. It must have been before the times of the Pharoahs, Kings and Emperors were there were no courts, only the edicts of the kings. In the more tribal times prior to that, we sat in circles, and the elders judged. So he is referring to the more modern times, and the use of legal protocols. Though, I must say, that from the inception of the ancient state of Israel, there were courts, and throughout Jewish history there has been a "legal" system based on Torah law, and courts to adjudicate and interpret according to these laws.
[^7]: **Law:** That is why the concept of common(sense) law is so important. There are certain things that are "normal", and one has to base a legal system on these foundational things. As the society grows and becomes more complex, so laws that have nothing to do with these foundational aspects begins to enter into the system. As long as they do not corrupt the system (which they inevitably do, as a consequence of concentration of power) the society will remain stable and functioning well. However, in the same way that the above Midrash expresses the gradual decline from petty theft to sin, so the legal system will suffer from that creep until it becomes authoritarian and corrupt itself.
[^9]: This is the first time the cubit is mentioned. Was it 18 inches at that time, or did it become 18 inches upon the standardisations that occurred later. Could it not be the size of a cubit in those ancient times was variable, just as the foot (the "royal" foot) was for many years in Egypt? It could also have been contextual, and change according to the context within which you are working. That is if you are building a massive structure like the Ark, perhaps the cubit was different to if you were measuring a room, for instance.
[^10]:
    Obviously the Jewish people were not a seafaring bunch, for the Ark to have only one window seems a bit confining to me. But it seems that they were shut off, enclosed for the duration of the flood as when the flood receded, Noah opened the window! He did not go onto the deck. <p>From which arises the question, was there a deck? There was no need for a cabin on the deck, no steering wheel, no sails or "rowers". So was there even a deck? In fact, did it "go" anywhere. Or did it just rise with the flood waters, and sink again when they receded to end up on Mt. Ararat.</p><p>Here is where there are these interesting magical elements that are introduced into the Torah, the proponents of which at this stage deny any magical elements in the story. We will only accept those miracles that extend from G-d (of which there are many, especially in stories like this). Yet we will only accept miracles to explain the things we cannot understand (like how did all the animals fit into a boat the size of the Ark), or else large magical/mysterious events.</p><p> Stones are magical, the <b>Umim</b> and <b>Tumim</b> being prime examples thereof. But there are many others too, and here Chizkuni mentions the crystal in the Ark.</p>
    [^11]: (Missing) This is a repeat of v6:13 in which the flood is first mentioned. It is referenced again in v7:4 again. Is this an example of the circularity of the narrative?<p>It also mentions the loading up of all the animals, and that G-d brought them to Noah (except for the "clean" animals) - where there was no Torah, and thus requirement for sacrifice of animals and no Kashrut yet, as Kashrut is based solely on the inclusion of meat in your diet. Even if G-d had done that, how long would it take to situate all the animals. It is useless to discuss the Ark, as it was a miracle &mdash; no doubt. Because little of it makes any logistical sense anyways.</p>
    [^12]: What covenant is this. Is it the one <i>Rashi</i> claims regarding the food not spoiling? But why would we need a covenant to cover that? But does not a covenant something regarding a relationship? That does not seem to fit in relation to the animals food. Is it referring (circularity) to the promise of the rainbow subsequent to the flood, which is <i>Sforno</i>'s view? I myself would hope that it was a covenant of continuation. That G-d was promising them that they would survive after the flood, and that is why he includes them all and says "You shall enter the ark, you and your sons, your wife and your son's wife with you.". Because the Torah does not specify what the Covenant between G-d and Noah was, I can only conclude that it was the original covenant of <b>פרוּ וּרִבוּ</b>&ndash;(you will) be fruitful and multiply. What would have been the use of destroying everyone?

The commentators claim that it took him 120 years. Now there is no mention of how long the "others" lived for we know there were other people alive on the earth. Yet an ark with the proportions described would not have taken 120 years to build. Nor could Noah have built it alone! And why did his three sons not help him?
[^18]: That they refrained from any intimacy during the time they were on the Ark is mentioned by the commentators in a number of places. However, this is contrary to normal human behaviour. The impetus in a situation of immanent annihilation would be to procreate because the birth of a child is the primary event that speaks of the continuation of our people. A response by the Sages might be that they were in such a holy state knowing they had the weight of the world to carry that they refrained. But again, that is not human, that is angelic.
[^19]: Today, the implication is that we do not hear G-d's command except as transmitted by the Torah. I say, it says often (<i>Nitzavim?</i>) for us to "hear G-d's voice". That is what we should be aiming for in our studies of Torah.
[^19a]: This method is a fundamental protocol. If you want to endear someone to you, or get closer to them, give them an offering.
[^20]: As G-d commanded Noah! If the animals had come of their own accord, would not the verse have read "as G-d commanded them". What had G-d commanded Noah... to gather the animals!
[^24]: The flood was 40 days on the earth; the waters became powerful, and they increased very much; and the waters became exceedingly powerful, and the mountains were covered up.

All the flesh that moved upon the earth perished the fowl, the cattle, the beasts, all creeping creatures and all mankind. Everything that had the breath of the spirit of life, of all on dry land, died (but not the fish). It blotted all beings on the face of the earth, from man to animal to creeping thing and all the flow of the heavens.

And the water prevailed 150 years.

In these verses, the waters "strengthened" is mentioned 4 times.

[^25]: Although the commentary says that trees were uprooted by the floods, how could Noah have expected the dove to return with some evidence (an olive branch) if all the vegetation had been destroyed in the flood as well.

This is some evidence that the flood was not water as we know it, but perhaps of some other "water", connecting with the "waters" that were separated by the firmament.
[^26]: Aviva Zornberg uses this Midrash to put forward the idea that Noah went through a deep change in his personality through this duty.
[^27]: In this case the Spirit of G-d passed over the waters, however in v1:2, the Spirit of the Lord hovered over the waters.
[^28]: Then, one could ask, if the sources were sealed, where did the water "recede" to. They could fill the great deeps but could not return through the windows of heaven.

[^29]: 150 days = about 5 months. On the 2nd month, 17th day flood began. On the 7th month, 17th day came to rest. On the 10th month, 1st day, the mountains appeared. What happend for 40 days and 40 nights? After 40 days, Noah opens the window. Where they enclosed in the ark, with no window, no light, little air, for almost 365 days?

That it cannot find a place for "the sole of its foot" is a strange turn of phrase, for it is a bird we are talking of here. In addition, even if it had found somewhere to land, it needed to prove that it had done so. In fact, it was gone for the day, as it only returned in the evening. It is difficult for a dove to fly all day long without a break, and if there were olive trees, there must have been other, more substantial trees around for it to rest on.

And why would it return with an olive branch? Why did it return with anything? That, in itself, was a miracle. The commentators just talk of the olive branch and its meaning, not on the actual event.

Which is how the commentaries generally go. On the background of G-d is capable of any miracle, and anything that does not make sense in the story is attributed to a miracle, or just ignored (a form of cognitive dissonance). [TODO: give examples of this].

I would propose that the relationship with the animals at that period of our evolution was much more intimate than that of today. Some say that we still spoke the Sinactic dialect, which was much closer to a root language. Perhaps we could speak the (or understand) the "language" of the animals, which would be very different to our human language. It would be far more "telepathic".

[^32]: In Noah's 601st year, in the 2nd month, 1st day the waters had dried. However, it was not till the 2nd month, 27th day that the earth had dried. Note that it took much longer for them to dry then for them to flood.
[^33]: The phrases used echo the phrases used to load the ark. Except here there is the blessing of life: Be fruitful and multiply.
[^34]: He built an altar and and sacrificed every clean animal and bird (of which he had collected 7 pairs). Where did he get this information from? And the aroma (of burnt flesh) was pleasing to the Lord.

Some imagery concerning the evil of man &mdash; however did not G-d make man with this evil in him? Or is it assumed that the evil that man cooks up he "created" &ndash; that is, he cooked it up himself?

[^35]: This is a strange commentary, as there would be no animals in the world around as they had all been destroyed in the flood. In fact, why were the animals destroyed, where they not innocent of sin, even if you include the animals that humans were cohabiting with. Which again speaks of a different kind of relationship between Man and beast.
[^40]: This is the first covenant. In which G-d says the rainbow represents His promise to man that he would never again break the natural cycles (see v8:22).
[^41]: Shem, Ham -> Canaan, Japhet. And the whole world spread out. They moved away, separated to different parts of the world. This also, once again, has no duration. It must have taken a while for these men, on their own to spread out all over the earth.
[^42]: Now, showing his humanness, Noah is referred to as a "man of the earth". For the first thing he does upon disembarking, is to plant a vineyard and get drunk. When he was righteous, he was a man of heaven.

This whole story of the "return" to earth after the flood is not very optimistic.

[^44]: Ham is specifically mentioned (again see v18) as the father of Canaan, in case we might forget, for he is the progenerator of the Canaan clan, who were mortal enemies of the Israelite (or else he was just a victim of the "ethnic cleansing" that took place upon the occupation of the land of Canaan).

In the Torah it sees he saw his father's nakedness. But some of the commentators go much further in this interpretation. Some say he had sexual relations with his father, others even go so far as to say that he castrated his father &ndash; now what would prompt him to do that to his father?

Note: Noah promptly curses his son, Ham. He does this in an interesting fashion. He curses the descendents of Ham to become "slaves of slaves". He then blesses <b>HaShem</b>, G-d of Shem. Finally he blesses Japhet, saying that his children will live in the tents of Shem. Thus creating a hierarchy amongst his three children.

[^46]: This mirrors the Jews complaining in the desert after the Exodus even after having been privy to the multitude of miracles that enabled their escape from oppression.

Note: It starts this narrative saying that the whole earth spoke one language, and had a common purpose. However, in the previous chapter (v5, v31,32) it spoke of the descendants of Noah's children as each one settling (and creating nations) according to their specific language and culture. However, how did such separate cultures arise so quickly. (Once again, no duration of time).

Was this just injected later into the story? What is its lesson? And what was this common purpose? It certainly was not building the tower of Babel.
