## Tetzaveh

### In depth

The word _tetzaveh_, "you shall command," also means "you shall connect" and "you shall bond."

_That they bring to you pure olive oil . . . to raise an everlasting lamp . . . from evening to morning (27:20–21)_

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    For such is our mission in life: to impart the eternity and perfection of the Divine to a temporal world, and to do so not by annihilating or overwhelming the world's temporality and diversity, but by illuminating its every state and condition&mdash;from "evening" to "morning"&mdash;with the divine light.
  </p>

_Pure olive oil, crushed for the light (27:20)_

<figure class='quote'>
  <p>
    Just as the olive yields light only when it is pounded, so are man's greatest potentials realized only under the pressure of adversity.

## Chapter 28

n28:2] _Glory_ accrues to a person even because of God-given abilities, while _splendour_ refers to the regard he has earned through his own accomplishments.

28:6-10] Is the order same as on the two _shoham_ stones, by birth?

28:17-20]  12 Stones

12 stones for the 12 tribes. Stones arranged on the _choshen_ in 4 rows.

28:30] _Urim v Tumim_

30 You shall place the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Tummim</i> into the <i>choshen</i> of judgment so that they will be over Aaron's heart when he comes before the Lord, and Aaron will carry the judgment of the children of Israel over his heart before the Lord at all times.
**into** breastplate, upon Aaron's heart.

   ל. וְנָֽתַתָּ֞ אֶל־ח֣שֶׁן הַמִּשְׁפָּ֗ט אֶת־הָֽאוּרִים֙ וְאֶת־הַתֻּמִּ֔ים וְהָיוּ֙ עַל־לֵ֣ב אַֽהֲרֹ֔ן בְּבֹא֖וֹ לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה וְנָשָׂ֣א אַֽ֠הֲרֹ֠ן אֶת־מִשְׁפַּ֨ט בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֧ל עַל־לִבּ֛וֹ לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה תָּמִֽיד:

n28:30] The Breastplate was folded in half to form a pouch-like pocket. Into it Moses was to insert a slip of parchment containing the Ineffable Name [according to _Rambam_ there was more than one]. This name was called _Urim_, from [אור]{dir="rtl"} _light_, because it would cause individual letters of the tribal names on the Breastplate to light up; and it was called _Tumim_, from the word [תָמים]{.heb}, _completeness_, because,  if read in the proper order, these luminous letters presented complete and true answers to the questions of national import that the Kohen Gadol would ask of G-d (_Rashi_ from _Yoma_ 73b_).

There are then two examples of this given. The first is around which tribe should begin the war against the Canaanites. The second is the regarding Hannah, when the Kohen Gadol Eli saw her and consulted the _Urim v Tumim_, the letters שׁ ,כ ,ר ,ה lit up. Instead of reading כְּשַׁרָה, _a worthy woman_, he read שִׁכֹּרָה, _a drunken woman_.

During the waning years of the First Temple era, King Josiah realised that _Eretz Yisrael_ would be conquered ... and he removed the _Urim v Tumim_ from the Breastplate and hid it. He also hid the Ark containing the tablets and the anointment oil. None of them were ever found again.

n28:33] Pomegranates: 72 bells, 72 pomegranates => 72 shades of white (מצורה metzora)

n28:41] [ומלאת את ידם]{dir="rtl"} - inaugurate, as in "fill hands" as opposed to empty-handed. Fill position, invested with authority - as in full hands.
40G

## Chapter 29

29:6-7] First place the turban on his head, then anoint him with oil?

29:21] Sprinkle blood and oil on the vestments... would that not soil them? Yet instead, it makes the clothes holy?

29:25-26] "You shall wave them, as a waving before HaShem". Interesting choice - what are they waving&mdash; not the people! It might be similar to the waving we do at the football matches.

29:35] 7 days of inauguration; twice a day. That would require $$14 * 3 = 42$$ sets of vestments or some subset of that.

n29:45] [וְהָיִ֥יתִי לָהֶ֖ם לֵֽאלֹהִֽים]{.heb} &mdash; _And I shall be their G-d_. God rests among us to accept with favour our prayers and service, and He guides our destiny without recourse to intermediaries (_Sforno_). It is not enough for G-d to rest His Presence amongst us; we must recognise that He is our G-d and act accordingly. We dare not take His closeness for granted.

n29:46] [וְיָֽדְע֗וּ...]{.heb} &mdash; _They shall know..._ When G-d dwells among the nation,  the people will realise that G-d's purpose in taking us out of _Mitzraim_ was to be our G-d and rest amongst us (_Ibn Ezra_). This show that G-d rests among us not merely for our benefit, but for _His_, as it were, because only Israel bears witness to His omnipresence and greatness (_Ramban_, _R. Bachya_).

## Chapter 30

30:7-8] [קְטֹ֣רֶת סַמִּ֑ים]{.heb} &mdash; Here we have the mysterious _spice-incense_. Every day, morning, and afternoon, continually "before
the Lord". In addition, no "alien incense", [קְטֹ֥רֶת זָרָ֖ה]{.heb}
