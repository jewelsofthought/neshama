Let us all gather here in sacred space. Knowing that sacred space is also a potential pivotal point, a gateway, or even a portal to another world, another way of being. Seeking an encounter with the Divine, we enter His/Her space hoping to meet the King, as much as we fear such an event&mdash;knowing that if it occurs, it is life-changing.

Most often, we are driven like sheep to such an encounter by our pain. Let us instead enter into our sacred space as an attempt to lucidly, consciously approach the throne. Let us do it as if it is critical to our lives and our futures&mdash;that it is for all humankind.

Perhaps this will cause the momentum to change everything, transforming into the world that is to come, the world we intuit in our highest beings. A world where we walk together with our deepest being having given up our desire to create the world as we see it, instead serving the directions that the Holy one, the True Creator is giving us.
