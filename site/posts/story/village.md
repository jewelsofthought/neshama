I needed some advice, and guidance at this point. So we set out to  mountains of Yeshirel. After many days journey, we arrived at the village of Chokmah. It consisted of a small cluster of Alderian huts, surrounded by thick shrubland. They were happy to see us, and for us to acknowledge them. They were waiting for us to arrive, and we danced and sang, bent over, stomping our feet, wailing and yoiking, with flourishes of joy and peals of laughter.

At some point, not planned, and not announced, the silence entered, and slowly the noise and laughter and movement ceased, each one, in their time, settled down and they all began to hum. We were all in  the visionary state and it was time for me to begin my journey. At  the first gate, I was met by the Guardian of Malkhoose. He was a Grimoran, tall and stately, dressed in a resplendant uniform. After greeting one another, we sat in the entry way, and drank the green iridescent liquid that he poured from a strange shaped vessel, with carving from another time. "Al-ekoshim Ha'el godol v'hoo ekad", "Hear, O great and small, wherever you may be, Ha'el, the great and magnificent, the awesome ruler over all, is One - and the Only One." He smiled and me, and the way was open for me to pass through. The path led down the cliff face, until I reached a small plain, with a  in the distance lake. I continued on the path to lake until I arrived at its shore. There was an island in the middle, with a black monolith in the center, and some sort of compound at the far end of it. The shoreline was bordered with some shrubs and trees, with patches of soft sand. I walked along the edge of the lake for a while, until I found a small canoe, and paddled out to the island. On the island, the Vav pillar stood out, clear and tall. It was about two meters high, shaped like a [×•]{text-is-large}. It was made of a dark shimmering crystal like rock, with a number of protrusions at various heights sticking out about twelve centimeters.  I walked up close to it, and peeling off my klipah, hooked it onto one of the protrusions, where it hung like a wet ghost sheet, with blank holes where the eyes and mouth and nostrils would be.

It was always a glorious feeling of lightness to be rid of my klipah, and revel in the essence of my ephemeral effervescence. I could move with ease, just by thought alone, yet I was still limited in what I could see &mdash; constrained by the very fundamentals of my perceptive capability. The years of training and practice enabled me to see visions and scapes that were beyond anything I had believed possible, all formed from the imaginary realm.

It was time. A short distance away was the compound. It was tucked I proceeded to my Temple that awaited me on the island.

Now I was ready to begin my true journey. I was not sure if male or female. I searched for a while, then returned to the pool I had found before and upon touching its waters was calmed.

Rushing, twirling around me, he came and pointed out the vortex that was above the village, a tornado of energy that swirled up to the sky, and led me on a hunt, a journey to find the Anker. We hid and stalked, we explored and shared, we discovered the Merkadah and in its Sefir was the Anker, and I received his transmission.

"You are to be the one to enter the wild beyond, the wilderness within the desolation by the empty lands. There you need to find the source of font of our waters. For only from the source, where the light is  clear, will you be able to learn the way of the Ashent that can take you to the One that is the Only One.
