> As soon as a the perception of a new space, or the possibility thereof, is discovered by/in human consciousness, there will always be those who will be drawn to explore that space - no matter the possible consequences, especially if it becomes the goal of a powerful man - or the obsession of one less so.

# The Jewel

There was a king who lived in a far away land. This king ruled over the whole world. He ruled over everything in it, from the tiniest insect to the behemoth. He ruled over the fire and the water, the winds and even the very breath that we breath. This king ruled for a long, long time. Long before there was even history.

When this king was a young man, still only a prince, he came to his father and announced that

There was ease and peace in his kingdom. His subjects all loved him dearly. They sang his praises constantly, and loved nothing more than regaling his wondrous deeds. The king himself was at peace. He had succeeded in his goal of bringing stability and prosperity to all his subjects.

[Chirabah](abyss.html) As a young man, the prince had undergone the most rigorous training in all the sciences and arts both of the apparent and the hidden. In order to claim the title of king he had to pass through the abyss of _Chirabah_, and return with the gift that he would receive, if he survived.

> He surrounded His Spirit in a precious crystal, so that it could still communicate with the faraway. We call these crystals jewels, or gems. However, each one of these jewels were so precious, that they were each given their own very special vessel with which to be kept safe - so that He could continue to communicate with all his subjects.

Each one of these gems was like a radio. It could transmit and receive broadcasts. Just like our radio, where we have a big transmitter from which we broadcast over a large area, and each one of the crystals in your little radio receives the signal and transmits to the radio. For now, we have to be satisfied with the simple crystal and translate it to electricity ourselves. Although I could easily imagine a crystal that receives light and transmits electricity... [chlorophyll](chlorophyll.html). Thus so far, we have only managed to find this occurring in organic molecules... which means living molecules, in the sense that they respond to external influences. There are just some that respond to light.

> Each one of these jewels were so precious to him, for he had imbued each one with some of his very essence, and thus each one contained something of his will. [magician](magician.html) In order to keep them safe, he decided to fashion a vessel in which to hold it. This vessel would be made from the strongest, and densest material that his scientists could imagine and his artisans could fashion. Once that was done, he began to place each one of these precious jewels in the container that they had fashioned. "In their image, they created them".

The one promise he swore to each one of these jewels, was that he would never stop communicating with any one of them. He would maintain contact with each and every one of them...

He did not anticipate the problem being that any might chose ever to not want this communication. And having to become in order to create the vessels, he suffered the very aspects that he'd used to fashion his vessels - hurt and anger. How could they?

Now, let's climb down to earth...

Each child is born with one of these precious jewels. In times past we called it perhaps it is like a blessing from G-d, or the kiss of an angel.

At birth that jewel is clean, and shines brightly. As the vessel grows larger, it needs more nourishment from its surroundings, and thus its appetite for the energy of the material that it exists in, from which it has been fashioned.

Thus the jewels becomes encrusted by the barnacles of life. The inputs of parents, siblings, teachers, and all those who wield power over these jewels - and who actually have been tasked with the honour of keeping them safe and clean - begin to cause the outer covering to become harder and the separation of the nut from its shell, or the jewels from its vessel, begins.

Now the messages that are being relayed through the jewel cannot penetrate this thickening outer layer, like a hard skin that surrounds the juicy nut. So it vibrates in the inner chamber of the vessel, but only the inner layers respond.

Those messages from outside, that the jewel, which responds to energy and frequency, receives are being affected by both the harmonics in the shell.

Now let's take a closer look at what is happening here. I am simplifying it, because there are details that I am glossing over. But bear with me, and hopefully you will get the picture.

Imagine a jewels that is vibrating in a chamber, and these vibrations, though dampened, are sending out certain frequencies - which have nowhere to go. Thus end up vibrating in the chamber itself, eventually setting up resonances, both harmonic and inharmonic. Eventually, the information will become so confusing, being unable to differentiate between those messages that are coming from the broadcast station and those that are produced as a result of the internal noise that is continuously reverberating in the chamber itself.

To put it more simply, the source of the messages now being received are not all valid. Some are internally generated, and will often result in recursion.
Another potential effect is its influence, both positive and negative, on the stream of messages being received.

Before continuing, we have to ask a pertinent question here. Where is the information that is being received by this jewel being transmitted to? Well, a certain amount is the feedback to keep the shell functioning properly. The rest ... well back along the channel that is receiving from faraway, not from the shell surrounding it.

Now that ends up at the receiving station, where someone looks at the message, and has to decide where to deliver it to. If it is a good message, it goes into the God stream. If it is a bad message, it goes to those who deal with bad messages. Which will depend on how bad it is.

To take it one step further. What will the information that will be now transmitted to the jewel from the station? The general broadcast will continue, but now the messages you receive will be influenced by the responses to the messages you sent up the pike...

Now, I am not going to say to anyone ever that I "know" what the purpose of our existence is or might be. But I will say that the best thing you can do in your life, is keep that jewel clean. It will guide you, and comfort you. It will help you change your life.

How do I keep it clean, you may ask. Well, you may be surprised to know that there are many manuals that describe how to do that - besides the many manuals that are to lead you astray (in order to harvest your energy).

However, before I mention some of them, I have to warn you. This is not about book learning. You cannot lean how to make love from a book. This requires hard work, determination, commitment, and more hard work. It is a lifelong pursuit that you have to follow in everything you do and say and eventually even think.

That's sounds awefully like brainwashing, you respond querulously.

Of course it is. I say gaily. There is only one way to wake someone up from a trance, and that is to rewire his perception of the world. And the only way to do that is to "rewire" his brain. Wash out the nonsense that has stained his mind.

The only difference is that this brainwashing is universal. It is the path to God.

Well, alright already. Speak to me of this path.

Before I do that, I have to explain to you that this that I narrative I am building has a number of levels. Now, as you know, we cannot begin at the top level, so we have to start at the bottom, at the beginning, so as to say. And, the beginning of course is represented by the number 1, the 1st.

However, this 1 persists. It never goes away. Thus the basic fundamental principle, that has to be engraved on your heart, your mind and your soul, is the fact that all is one. [shma](sham.html)

Every practice will have this at its core. The Shma in Judaism, the Om in Hinduism, the Tao in Taoism... etc. At its core it acknowledges the fundamental principle that everything comes from the One. And is just an expression thereof.
