## Brain story

In the story of the Brains, I have used this idea. The world they live in and interact in is one of holographic projections and scenes that change as if by magic. For example, if two people are sitting at a table, and want to have a cup of tea, the tea will "appear" on the table and they will "drink" it, enjoying its taste and texture – and all this is happening in the world of projections that they have created, except for the actual experience of drinking the tea. And the tea you were "drinking" would taste any way you wished it to.

This is part of the education that the Brain undergoes in his youth.

### Scene

Sitting around in some sort of session, the ask is to introduce yourself. Remember this is the time that there is a machine-brain congruence, and that we have inserted brains into machines. Perhaps we have even reached the point where the "consciousness" can enter into a place that we have prepared in the machine.

"Who are you?"

"I am a combiner for agricultural equipment."

### Brains

The idea begins as an extrapolation of some of the directions in which our modern science is heading. Taking into account genetic manipulations, stem cell research, and as machines get more complex and we get closer and closer to a merging of the biological and the mechanical-electronic, with talk of man-made implants in the body to enhance it's capabilities or to repair our bodies, and following these lines of thoughts to the n'th degree, we are approaching the time when our bodies will become redundant, with the ability of machines to replace a lot of the functional needs of a body. For instance, the earth digging machine, controlled by a human, could be replaced by a brain that is tied into it in some form or fashion, and controlling it through electronic impulses.

Having no bodies, there is no need for vegetation, or animals. These brains can survive anywhere. In fact, the is for only for materials for their environment, power for their machines, and nutrients for their own consumption. These nutrients can be "printed" by any foodmaker machine as long as it has the correct ingredients, most of which can be grown or assembled by nutrient-maker tools.

</summary>
<p>
The other question that arises is whether we are beings of light manifesting a body, or a material manifestation, dreaming of being a light being.
</p>
</details>

Anyway, I will describe the first paragraph a little slower and in more detail. I am just trying to jot down ideas.{.note}

There have also been a lot of ideas around how do the brains control their environment, and how it looks. In the beginning I started with brains suspended in a nutrient solution, encased in a bell jar. However, I think it makes more sense for it to be a gradual process.{.note}

### History

The first brain(s) are attached to large machines. They have electrodes on their brains, and that is how they communicate. There were many years of experimentation before this step was taken. That is, we experimented with people controlling machines with electrodes wired to their brains. We found it easier if the electrode was close to the brain, itself. The first actual test transitions took place voluntarily of course. There were convicted felons that were about to be executed that volunteered, yet we were leery of that route, as we did not know what the result would be. Would they still be evil, just transformed into an evil genius? For we anticipated potentially huge jumps in our thinking if we could harness a "pure" brain. I believe it was Einstein who conjectured that we use about 2% of our brain's capacity, and we have always wondered what would happen if we used 10%. I could only imagine the result it we could use 90%. However, there were some terminally ill, or critical patients, who were willing to participate, and they were more welcome candidates.

So, eventually the first brain appeared. It was connected to a large interface, and slowly communicated and we learned about this new form of life. In the beginning, it was scary &mdash; especially for the new "brain-child". Then, after gaining some experience, it realised that it's capacity for feeling, was increased, just as it's mental abilities. For instance, joy, being totally felt, and not being distracted by any bodily needs, was overwhelming. Also, it's ability to compute and work out stuff and recognize patterns, was amazing. Very quickly, we discovered the memory problem. It seemed that our brain forgot things very quickly. But the ability of this brain to remember was phenomenal.

### Memory

A sideline was that very soon after the transition, we discovered, and proved, that long-term memory is in the body. And the brain is largely a computing and recognition device, with a fairly transient retention period. Using electronic on-board memory devices that contained this information solved this. Eventually, this information was kept in quantum states.{.note}

There is an interesting thought that evolves here. If, we were beings of light, and used the quantum states of atoms and molecules to keep information (perhaps a lot of the molecules that exist are repositories of information). Just like transistors, if we could read their arrangement, we would see that they did, in fact, store information.{.note}

This of course in the long run became a shared repository of information. So that all the knowledge gained by these brains was shared amongst all brains. So, all their information was immediately available to all. Making for excellent collaboration, and thus leaps and bounds in their understanding.{.note}

### Species

So, my story actually begins with a species, called for now Branes that appeared. At first they existed in bell jars, suspended in a solution, with electrodes attached to their brains, and served by a huge array of computers and mechanical equipment. They had the ability to communicate with the computer electronically. That is, by the manipulation of the voltages and electro-mechanical expressions of their brains, they could manipulate the electronic currents in these electrodes, so as to give commands to the machinery surrounding them. Also they had the ability to read the signals coming off these electrodes and were capable of assimilating information this way. Eventually, this became second nature to them, and they were able to almost inject themselves into the circuitry and project their intentions along these pathways, and yet retain awareness of themselves.

### Human Form

Now, for some reason, they all projected themselves in a form that was very like our human form. For, although they were just brains, they interacted as holographic projections of beings that had human form. So, they sitting down for tea would be an appearance of 2 beings of human like form. At the same time a chair would appear, with a table. They would sit at the table and a teapot with cups would manifest. The tea would be poured and they would drink it. For them it was an elaborate ritual, and all of this was because of the "Great Myths". The Principae laid all this elaborate behaviour out. Over the millennia, it had grown and become more complete, but the essentials remained the same.

One was only to project yourSelf in this form. This had the corollaries of manifesting possibilities taking into account this form, and they way it moved. The description of the form is very complete, and in the beginning was both descriptive and mathematical. Now it is almost completely mathematical. But the descriptions are kept as side notes. So, a chair is an easy possibility, for it fits into the range of the possibilities of the required form. What an elaborate and wonderful game (like the Glass Bead Game).

Now, we know, that the reason for this, in the beginning, was so that the brains could interact with one another in a manner that  would appear "normal".

### Galactic spread

The brains realised very soon that earth might become inhospitable both to them and perhaps to the living beings themselves. They began to create biospheres in which they could live as long as needed. These biospheres became totall self-sufficient, so they turned their attention to the solar system and even set their sights on the stars beyond.

By the time our story begins, they have spread across the galaxy.
Many years have gone by, and they have spread so far and wide, that they no longer remembered where they came from. Because of some "errors" in the original systems, they live according to the Great Myths of the Imaginary, and the four tombs of Parnassius, and Elianary, their first Routers.

They have harnessed the energy in the atom properly. They have managed to store huge warehouses of information on the atomic level in tiny memory cells. They can extract close to 100% of the energy from the atom. They can travel across space by bending time and space. They are interacting with their surroundings on the quantum level, understanding fully the principle of small effects, or chaos.

After the machines, they created much more compact devices that they used, allowing them to become mobile. Their interface became even more compact and integrated, and they basically had a mobile jar in which they travelled. Eventually, understanding the fabric of the make up of the universe, the brains were encased in a special material, that both fed them and transmitted and received their information, and commands, i.e. will.

### Reproduction

They way they reproduce, is through a spontaneous interaction that occurs between two brains, in which they experience a form of union that they discovered. This allows them to reach a space in which they "know" one another &mdash; a non-physical form of love-making. As a result of this "spark" of recognition, one of them will begin to experience a growth, and will be fed a special nutritional mix. The growth will eventually fall off, and upon it doing so, will be transferred to its own jar, where it will be fed a special diet. It will be taught, and soon will interface with the rest of the brains. Only upon this occurring, will the two be aware of masculine and feminine, and will tend to retain the type that manifested itself in this first interaction – though not necessarily.

### Story Begins

Now, as our story begins, our brains are in trouble. There have been no births for many, many years now, and they have definitely noticed:

"There can be no doubt. Our birth rate is almost zero. We are no longer propagating."

As per M's suggestion, I thought a way of entering the story, could be that someone in this day and age, or a little in the future, is starting to have dreams, and these dreams are:

Of someone standing in front of a huge screen, talking to the screen. On the screen appear various molecules, images of humanoid beings, and the things they do. Mathematical equations come and go, and he mutters often, "It is true. It is real. It is possible".

I thought of this scene occurring as the credits are rolling on the screen. Remember, that all the scenes that include the brains are holographic, and thus translucent. They can also create their environment with thinking it into existence. So, what we would actually see is a translucent being standing or sitting in front of a screen, and the environment would morph at times, just kind of shift.{.note}

### Adam & Eve

One ordinary day, Mada, went to sleep and work to find another beside him. "It" seemed to be asleep. The other, Chava, and Mada

He began very carefully to orchestrate it. He would have to accept the reaction his appearance might spark-off. How to affect their development as much as possible, in a positive direction, yet be an acceptable player.

He chose &mdash; maybe because it was through belief &mdash; The Great Myths with the Divinity Myth as his backdrop.

He nudged an idea in my mind, and out came the concept of Ha'Shem, the One amongst the multiplicities that existed at that time.

---

### From Above

Remember that they lived in a time of ease. Oh, yes, of course, there was pain, and death, and conflicts, but on the whole, they had enough to eat, could roam as their beasts could carry them, had enough space and worshipped.

He knew from the beginning that the problem was Love. However, what he did not know was whether this signified the dearth of his race, or a temporary aberration.

He remembered his feeling when they realised that the humanoids were non-productive too. It was then he knew that he was right. From that moment on he became totally committed, not willing to compromise. He knew the answer. It was obvious to him that his deeper desire was to give his kind a new lease on life. Extinction, even for such as them, was difficult to accept, and he wished for his species to continue. Here his desires were met gladly by knowing that, albeit in this perhaps roundabout manner, he had ensured continuation, even if only, by a new beginning.

Understanding all this, he knew he would have to begin to interact with the humanoids. But he would have to move very cautiously. For a too extreme a jump ahead could cause serious dislocations.

He maintained that although it was not good to disregard the past and its lessons because of some problem, he would, however, go along with it.

At the meeting it became apparent that the equation was symmetrical and came out with a negative as well as a positive. Clalpin proposed the negative once again. Lathar countered with the argument that pure negative would be as stagnant in the end as pure positive. This was accepted. The interplay between good and evil, inhalation and exhalation.

---

### In the Garden

Upon returning they found things to be different to when they'd left. Food was scarcer. Every need had not been attended to, so they had to begin fending for themselves. Tribal power structures had begun to emerge.

Lathar, continued this trend. (Abraham). They solved the problem of babies in the following manner. When two humans had sex, it was noted. And every so often, after the event, a baby was delivered (Story of the stork? Or do they implant the fertilized egg in the womb?)

A couple of generations later, he instills the prime myth – the commandments, etc. Meanwhile the descendent of Allsta walks the earth. He too has women. This is the age where the human becomes aware of death and suffering and the need for solace.

Allsta's runs away with his people and one woman, Evegreen.. They become closer and more valuable to one another until they fall in love.

This is the point. In love, they make love. This will produce a child. Also it is manifested as a light earthquake in the brains' existence. It penetrates like a geyser of energy, upsetting things, for something like this has never occurred before. This at minimum causes the brains to realise what has happened, or at most, themselves to reproduce.

---

### The Meeting

"It has been a long time now since the last cyber was born. We have been coasting along till now. Now is the time to declare a 'state of emergency'. All our resources must be utilized in order to solve this problem. No stones should be left unturned, no route untried.

Thus I am giving a carte blanche to every idea. Of course the usual channels must be followed. But every idea will be taken seriously and fully investigated."

- The setting up and organizing of the experiment.

Nanta's heart jumped. This is what she'd been waiting to hear. She had always known her time would come.

Now all she had to do was prepare her proposal. She could hardly wait till the end of the meeting to rush home and contact the core to start immediately.

A couple of weeks of hard work, was all it took.

This is what was proposed.

"For many years now, we have been investigating the Ancient Myths. As we all know, we retain our 'form' because of them. Know that once you were of human form. And, in order, to retain and remember your roots, upon coming to consciousness, choose your form, and maintain it, as is described in the Laws of Humanity.

The question we asked was whether these Myths were a distinct, mathematical, possibility or whether they had been perverted or were obscured for other, esoteric and political reasons."

"Blasphemy," cried Rashi. "Why were we never informed of this?"

"For that very reason!" Nanja retorted. "We knew that it would not go well with the center. So we organised ourselves into a core group, and our hobby, pursued the problem. I, alone amongst my compatriots, was driven. They all looked it as a game."

"We do not believe any harm was done. And now it seems to me that the reason has become clear."

"For if the myths are accurate…"

"Blasphemy. Of course they are!" interjected HaGoan.

"Something has been lost." Nanja refused to be distracted. "We have strayed. Perhaps if we returned to the roots and observed them and their development, we will find what we have lost."

"Although I do not believe it will be easy. For birth is a complicated process, connected with the life-giving force, of which we are all just products, just creations, and not sources."

"We know all is well as far as we can see. Thus what is missing must exist on, what is, at least to us, an invisible level. May the Great One, Elokim, give us the sight to see what we cannot see."

"Thank you all for listening…"

"Now what we wish to do is complete our equations. We are almost there. Then build and nurture a planet to provide the necessary conditions for the existence of the mythical human form."

Throughout the movie the brains are represented as holographic images. If the "brains" are seen, they are in the background, secondary. Only towards (or at) the end will (should) the truth be revealed.{.note}

## Experience of the Brain

This brings an interesting line in that the brain controlling the android would be able to experience everything the android is "feeling" – ie data collection – but the brain would "feel" the feelings, as the android would have little feeling beyond what would have been programmed into it. In fact, the skin covering would be indistinguishable. Only the innards would differ, in that it was essentially a bio-machine, and could be grown in laboratories. This is the way that they could be created far away from their "handler" – if they were a p-android (personal android).

In fact, one could have multiple androids, of different shapes, doing different things in the universe at once. Like watching more than one TV channel simultaneously. Or playing two or more computer games at the same time. Admittedly, not for everyone!

This, being the major form of entertainment, and one could only imagine the incredible amount of information that could be garnered this way.

→ One could also surf the universe on the energy waves, and m-wave background that exists everywhere. [By 5d, you are able to surf the nothingness, which in fact contains a huge amount of energy.]{.note}

## Shaman tribe

→ Finally, one could move around the universe in one's astral body, as in a Shamanic Journey. In fact, this was the next stage of journeying that was discovered, and that is to move around as an entity, and be able to influence things by tapping into the very lines that were used to crate and exist and act in that way.

This could also be an alternate unfolding of the story. The one line was to the Brains, the other to the Shamans, who used conscious journey work to travel the galaxy.{.note}

Here is an expansion on the story:

We have the Branes, and the "humanoids" created by the Branes, and then the Shaman's.

The Shaman tribe are the one's who rejected the path into Branes, and remained in their bodies on earth. As time went by, and more people turned into Branes, there began to be hostility between the Branes and the Humans that remained. These Branes developed technologically extremely fast, and had reached a stage of development whereby they had become almost independent of their environments, and needed only power and material. This was available on many other worlds.

So, soon they left the planet, with only a small contingent remaining, and began to explore the solar system.

Eventually they overcame the barriers preventing them from reaching the stars, and travelled along galactic lines all over the galaxy.

In the meantime, there was a huge upheaval on earth, whereby severe restrictions on technological advancement were enacted, and people had to find other means, in addition to the scientific one, of interpreting and dealing with the world around them.

They organised in small, autonomous groups in the beginning, until they could co-ordinate with one another and grow larger. An incredible flowering occurred, a merging of science-and-spiritual, and so the Shamans flourished.

They too came to understand the 4-d waves that influence our physical reality. There method of transportation (and communiation) however, was by projecting their astral forms. Thus they too could explore far off planets, creating a kind a holographic representation around them. In the beginning there actual forms of inter-species communication was quite primitive, and they had to inhabit the body of some being that had the capability of speech in order to actually communicate.

Lately they have been able to speak from anywhere. So they normally due it with a holographic representation of themselves, that actually speak.

## Story lines

- See [Trial of the Dragon](/posts/story/dragon/)

- See [Reflections of R Y"mba](/posts/story/reflections/)

### Definitions

BCI - Brain Computer Interface
JBCI - Dreams and BCI

### (i) Jk: → Kab

- See [Mekubalim](/posts/story/mekubalim/)

→ Deeper into mysteries
→ Practice, become more traditional
→ Study in Kabbalistic Yeshivot
→ Merkava Descent, Invoking name of G!d, or angels
→ Communicate with Brains/Atlantean (Angelic – is the communication the Brains have with other beings. This occurs in 4th and 5th dimensions)

Because, from the beginning, the Jk's acknowledge the angelic realm, they have been working with them to deal with the 4th dimensional realm.

In fact, there is now a Kabbalistic interpretation of the universe, having extended the 2d version extant in 3d to a 4d version. One can only manifest one dimension higher or lower than the one that one is existing in. Kabbalah would say that you cannot create in the intellectual realm. . .

### (ii). JBCI: → (man)

→ Feeling things from 4th dim.
→ Entering the path towards the 4th dimension. To be able to participate in BCI will cause this to start happening. This will be an "unexpected consequence" of this.

As the "brain" of the JBCI becomes more remote from the actual physical event, so this occurrence of information and connection to the "universal neural net" will become stronger, and the tendency will be for the Brains to become more and more hive like.

But in order to hear the Atlantean voices (from 4d), the JBCI brain firstly has to come to terms with the angelic realm of communication.

### (iii). LSH: → (woman)

→ Shaman, helps deal with interactions and communications
→ Of course, a woman enters the story.

---

There is only one line of communication (or field of interaction – eg vesica pisces), one place where the two realms (dimensions) meet. Kabbalah is one way of getting there, BCI is another, prophetic shamanism is another. Probably yoga, meditation and definitely entheogens.

## Silver Surfer

### Q-story

It goes like this: This is an aspect of the 5d consciousness. However, because of indeterminacy, it cannot predict "when" it will emerge into 3d. Also, there are certain constraints, or shall we call them guardians along the way. For instance, Metatron is one of them, as the Prince of Form. I would think Samael is another.

So this is how we get into this kind of thing.

The basic idea is to write a "quantum" story. That is, pretend that I am a pilot of a q-steed (quark) or a e-steed (electron) or a p-steed (proton), or an n-steed (neutron), etc. All these sub-atomic steeds are different and have different characteristics.

On the quark level, we have a "connection" with certain quarks, which will lead us to and are essential to the "manifestation" of our steed. It is that we will connect to our quarks, and by gathering them, we will create a sub-atomic particle. At the base, are the fermions and the leptons – male and females! Oh we could have fun here.

This then brings us to the atomic level, and then we have the molecular – those are "organisations" or "armies", or "collectives" that work together. There are the usual comings and goings.

The idea is to play it from the point of view of the quantum. That is, telling the story from the aspect of a quantum consciousness, a qp – a quantum person. That is, that he has identity and consciousness.

It starts of by learning or finding your steed. There has to be a specific bond for that, and that is a story in itself…

[From a Brain story & higher dimensional beings, it is one who has reached a level of consciousness that he/she can hold a single quantum point of consciousness steady enough, and consistently enough to be able to "ride" a quanta.]

Once you have your steed, you never ride any other, for each one has a specific rider – that is, it carries a certain and very special consciousness.

These "steeds" are connected to all others, but there are only certain "groupings" that are received generally speaking. And there is a hierarchy of that, depending on your type and position.

The interesting aspect is the movement from "wave" to "particle" from idea to manifestation, and that takes some sort of transitioning (that I haven't yet worked out how to describe).

The easiest way to run this story, is to anthropomorphise this field. In other words, I exist in this quantum universe as a incarnated being – a human/quman being. And this is my story. Growing up and becoming the steed rider, a silver surfer. Having an existence in and on the quantum level. Thus to the one (me) living on that level things are as solid for me as they are for you here in the 3D reality. I am also completely unaware of the existence of this 3d reality, as it is so different and so "far" from my reality, that to all intents and purposes, I have no chance of ever interacting with it in any meaningful sense.

However, due to our advanced mathematics, we know there must be a "lower" dimensional reality. It is much denser and slower moving than ours, etc, etc, etc. So part of the story is ending up describing 3d from the view of a quantum being.

Our hubble telescope will be able to identify an organism that exists in 3d – and it would be massive and containing immense energy – just like the galaxies look to us here on earth.

One avenue is to have a human begin have some intense dreams. These feelings of not being here, but of being in this quantum world that he is dreaming about. So in this world, he is trying to tell someone (not sure who – gf, wife, psychologist, best friend).

We can play with all sorts of quantum effects, non-locality, Pauli's Exclusion principle, eigenvalues to keep track of the jump, fermi energy to effect things, need to attain the correct fermi level for to enable a jump, alpha decay as a form of transportation – perhaps the decay is vector and has a direction or should one rather say, purpose?

We must think like a 4d up to a 7th dim one, and there is a stage of _Chochma_, where there is no diff. between our concept of good and evil.

Perhaps I can use some of the kabbalistic characteristics and levels too.

### Story

I was fast asleep in my cocoon when the call came, and, as things were in my world, my response was instantaneous, and before I knew it, I was mounted on my 3Å 10ev steed, kitted up and speeding into action. Such was the life of a quantum rider (q-rider), or, as we liked to refer to ourselves, Silver Surfers.

Well, it was not that quick. I had to rise, and make my obeisance, for always, my first waking thought is to be in gratitude. Then I had to don my cleator, which, to those of you who are unaware, is my connector skin. The one that makes me able to connect fully with my steed and through her, the rest of my clan. I took my amour with me, in case I had to cross over, and then would need her protection.

The brief was that there was an imbalance happening in sector 33.

The image is one in which I ride the quanta, as a quantum rider. Remember that it is also angelic, for the story is taking place in the angelic realm. So there will be the quantum realm of energy with the quantum rider, and the angelic expression of energy, as well. The unfolding should be an analogy for those two realms, and where possible, include human realm references.

This is a story, as well, of multi-dimensional beings. Let us say our "main" character, the quantum rider, is a 4dim being, and his dimensions are the lower, demonic realms, the upper, angelic or heavenly, realms, and this the middle earth, and then he/she/it is a being that is not of time and space. He appears in this realm as a quanta.

What is the energy that manifests as a galaxy? Is it a greater, meta-angel? A higher dimensional being, whose appearance here is galactic? Or is it the same 4dim energy that can appear both as a quanta and a galaxy—being not of space, then the two could be equivalent?

The essential difference here is the energy. Though there are very specific protocols of behaviour for this energy. My story is unfolding as a quanta that connects to other quanta to create an atom (which is a "family"), and these atoms collaborated to create molecules, (i.e. corporation)—which is now a tribe, or neighbourhood, and, as such, has a much more complex collection of protocols, each one, though, made up of, or built up from, these original set of simple edicts, or protocols upon which the whole shebang needs to be founded. Just as a building needs a firm and unmoving foundation, so do the basic building blocks, i.e. structure, of this creation need to be similarly unbending.

The meaning of Atom is "Man" and "Of the earth, the red earth". Its origin is a "Variant of the Hebrew name Adam". Atom = גרעין  nucleus, or seed (seed, kernel; (biology) nucleus (of cell); (physics) nucleus (of atom) ; small group of people; kernel, grain; small group of people planning to establish a new settlement ; (syntax) head ; גרעינים – grains.  However, גרעין, refers to the nucleus of the atom, not the atom itself. Maybe exercise a bit of poetic license here?{.note}

I like the idea of a higher dimensional being being the "consciousness" that holds all the pieces together. Thus the concept of a "leader" is not one who leads in the way we lead, but of one who leads because he has awareness of, and actually lives in, a deeper, i.e. more dimensions, space.

If I continue the analogy I am trying to present, then these protocols of behaviour will be expressed as very strict codes of interaction amongst these "people" i.e. angels/quanta. This is expressed by the exactness (or seeming exactness) of the chemical and nuclear interactions amongst these basic particles—the atom.

First I awaken to myself and my "beingness", basically to the awareness of myself—though they say that angels do not sleep. So what would I be doing in the "down" periods? Similarly to my awakening. I make my obeisance. [Modeh ani]

Then I get on my steed – my quanta. It is like riding the light, [so I could also be called "light rider"]. In fact, in order to manifest, it has to pass via the light gate. The dark gate is the return gate. Now I am connected. And, if I have to transition, I find my context – like arriving at work.

Immediately I find myself in my "context" [Similar to awakening] and immediately make my obeisance. [Modeh Ani] [What should emerge from this is that my life is very "controlled". Almost hive like.].

### Poem

Riding the warps through
intricate, intimate, intrinsic spaces,
We break through
Iahi and I,
Two shimmering surfers,
clear to the meme as we
slow down back into the density.

We glide along,
joyfully riding the waves
of this wondrous place.

"Well, what have we here?"
I murmur, as we enter
the space of a small yellow dwarf.

She had some chicklets,
around her floated 9 bodies,
her offspring.
Each one lovely,
teeming with energy and light
with their own little
moon-children.

A look into some simple spacial features of humans as compared to animals. It was an exploration which started from the first diagram on the left. Then I thought to simplify it even more, and so these latter two emerged, showing clearly two things. The first is the obvious horizontal versus upright nature of the two. The second is their amazing similarity. The third, and to me, intriguing, is the obvious difference between the space occupied by the animal that shifted to become the space used by our arms, which are extremely dextrous, and one could say 3d, as opposed to the far more resticted spacial features of the legs. Both cannot bend backwards - we need to walk into the future, and do the work that is in front of us, where we can keep an eye on what we are doing, rather than behind us, where we hide our things.

As the sages say: "Only the fool trips on what is behind him".

### ToL Story

When I received the phone call from the Secretary of the Global Federation, I knew that we had entered the turning point.

We were over 1m before we even had any public presence. We just arose and grew quietly and unobtrusively. A piece here, a piece there &ndash; and still only we knew all the connection.

Info had to be locked in a vault until we gained sovereignty.

When we topped 10m, it was becoming very obvious that there were many positives to being part of this emergence.

UN Speech:
   Pivotal point

- 1m
- 100m @ 10% => $10 -> $1B/mth - $12B/yr

- associated businesses and other dealings...
