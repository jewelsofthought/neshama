Emerging from childhood, it was a series of apparently benign meetings that caused him to leave his village, and all his loved ones behind. For many years he yearned to be back, missing the wondrous land that had spawned him. Although many have said that it may have started when his father died – and he might agree, if only in a subliminal way, for it was no doubt that event that changed him in ways he was unaware of.

It was many decades later, he recalled, at one of the gatherings, that he spoke of that time with his siblings, and discovered many things about that period and how it affected his own growth. But I digress.

"Mmm, baruch ata elohim, sh'kaymenu, v'higianu" the murmuring went on, as I tried to memorize my portion from the Book, and the prayers, incantations and movements I needed to know for my upcoming initiation. His sightless eyes seemed to look upwards, as his frail body swayed in ecstasy. Blind from birth, Ha'derech had learnt every single nuance, every word, every symbol of the Book. He lived in a small hut a little ways from the village, and was cared and tended by the tribe, for he was a holy man, a blessed spirit and just to spend some time in his presence was a gift.. And I was to spend a whole year learning my portion with him.

P'Ragur was another story completely. He had come from another village with his family, to learn with us, as was common amongst the confederation, and we met – for the life of me I cannot remember how – but does it really matter with these life-changing meetings? He was a little older than me, and spoke with a funny, clipped type of accent. He reminded me of one of the famous performers, N'Jager, who they all said was of the Jaguar family, and he sang and often acted like one – a black jaguar. When I first heard of him, and saw him, I knew he was dark, and troubled. However, back to more mundane tales.

P'Ragur and I became friends, as he had moved into a hut close by, and seemed to have no siblings with him. We played a lot in the fields, and on the hill side. Two others L'an and D'Lefi joined us and often played with us. We went on lots of adventures, some real, some we created for ourselves. We were at the so-called physical stage, pre-warrior, where you learn about your body and your abilities, always testing and stretching yourself. We used to creep out at night and play night games, for instance. Jumping up and off 12' walls was another…

It was late one evening, and P'Ragur and I were lounging around under the stars when he first talked to me of spirits. Now I had heard stories around the fire before. I participated (kind of) in our rituals, but something he said made the hair on my neck stand up.

We were lounging around, like young children do everywhere. Our concept of time was still endless, and we were talking of things, learning, exploring, questioning, when he said:

"I have seen a spirit!" I felt the shivers down my spine.

"When?" I only half-believed him. I had heard tales of such things, but never met one myself. My own abilities were in the areas of recognition of patterns, which extended to being able to recognise beings from far off distances. Already there had been talk of that in the tribe.

"A couple of times, when I was younger."

It was as if my life was changing, right there before my eyes. I had to know more. I felt the charge of Kundulini energy that ran up and down my spine. I knew then that my life was going to be very different. I had experienced a Heneni moment.

"Tell me more."

"Just before dropping off dropping off to sleep, there was a wind in my room, although it was still outside. The curtains blew, and I felt something in there with me. I was too scared to say anything, so I pretended to be asleep. Then it was gone, and all was still. I wasn't sure if I was awake or asleep when that happened. But, when it occurred on another night, I knew it was something else."

"Did you say anything to it? Did it communicate with you?"

"The second time, I was more prepared. So I sat up in bed and asked in a clear voice, "Is there anyone there". I heard, or imagined, a kind of a sigh. That was all. And so it has been"."

"How many times has it happened to you?"

"Oh, about five or six times", he answered, casually.
