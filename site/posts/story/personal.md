## Monogamy (2016)

All my life I wanted to share with my partner any dalliances with other woman that I wanted to do, or did. And I had that for a long time. Then I fell deeply in love with a South African woman, who has insisted that I remain monogamous, and it is only since I had a couple of affairs, and she totally freaked out, that I have been considering having discreet affairs totally disconnected from my life ala last tango in Paris.

So, when the woman said hello,to me as I walked by Pima proverb in camps bay, and I responded, noticing her friend trying to get a peek at me, I knew what this was about. They were two women on holiday looking for some action. I continued on because I had made arrangements to meet with Jenn and rob, and was already running a bit late. Upon approaching the car, I could still feel their pull, and was considering cancelling and entering this tête-à-tête.

As I drove away, I looked into my feelings. I should be feeling proud of myself for not succumbing to the temptation, instead I felt more that once again spirit was offering me an adventure that I was denying, because of comfort.

I could have returned to the place, had a cup of coffee, and then excuse myself, and make an arrangement to meet tomorrow evening. It is what I am trying to do now, and that is step into the world as a man and take charge of my life - and accept responsibility for another's.

## Dream (2016-03-22)

Woke in pain. Body aching, some molten energy in body, hurting. Did not fight it, rose switched light on. Went into garden and peed.

Then dreamt. In place with others in b&b type place. Gathering or convention. People all around. Had been in room no 3. This was continuation of previous dream which I don't remember, just vaguely, almost like feelings.

Returning to room 3. Had difficulty finding it. Was in mess, but recognized it.

Slept outside in garden on grassy patch. with some companion who was like a Servant or a pupil, or even a presence. Now, in the light of the day, it feels like it might have been lyn, who is tracking me, afraid, all the time.

Wake up to see rats coming onto grass, but they retreat back to bush surrounding patch. Lie down again. Then these black beetles, making a shrill chirping sound appear, and their energy is malevolent, so we leave post-haste I've had enough.

Return to structure, towards my room. Pass by people in building. One says to me nice fire style you have, and points to my head. I glance in the mirror, and see something sticking up like a Mohawk cut in the middle of my forehead. I look more carefully and relies that it is a big black praying mantis type of insect. I brush it off, and it flies off me. I cannot see it. So I go into the large room next to the corridor that leads to the rooms - the corridor is where this happens - and warn everyone about this insect. The next moment this young woman sitting just in the corridor rises and swats this malurgie that was on a pillar/outcrop on in the corridor. She uses her hand and just smacks it, not concerned at all about its derems squishing all over her hand.

I wake up, kind of disturbed and angry, feeling trapped in this situation with lyn in Hogsback. Then I start fantasise about her arriving and being her master... Stand, hands behind back. Tie them. Cane her over beam. Stick my cock deep in her throat. Place her on knees and get her to worship my cock....

Then think of Rachel at party. Want last tango in Paris interaction. Just approach her and offer her one night of sex. No names, no relationship, just night of enjoyment. Let's kiss, and then you decide.

Think of living my life in that masculine mode, instead of the new ages nicer nicely, thinking of the other, being pic, caring about the other, etc, Eric. I am not advocating violation, or rape, or anything like that, but being clear and expressing your needs or wants in the situation, and the if the universe responds positively.... Making it happen.

Blessed are you o Lord, our God, who is the creator and manifest or of all things, good and bad.

## Lyn (2016)

I just want to express my gratitude for what we shared together. For the gift of offering and opening your home and your heart to me. For being willing to embark with me on and share the journey of our lives so deeply. You will always remain a part of my life. You helped me go through a transition, one which you were a mirror of and for me and for you. For me, it is always a humbling and awe inspiring event in and for my life when I meet someone with whom I can go so deeply and so intimately so immediately. It is immense and for that I will always be grateful. I just want you to know how appreciative I am of all that you gave and received. I am honored and was deeply nurtured by all that occurred between us.

I am not meant to share this, because it will be feeding the energy of love between us, which is forbidden according to the code of honor that is a requirement of a shared and committed life, a life filled with principles and honor as defined by our culture. But I will do so anyways, and know that I do it in another dimension, a place of other, than what is required to be in this world realm, because I rather that, than dishonour what we had with spirit. But we can justify any action anyway, so it also boils do an to that I want to share with you in my gratitude.

Each time I enter your car, I breathe in your smell. I think and thank you while driving and send out thoughts of love and joy. No wonder you felt me at times.

## Dream (2016-03-23)

Remember part where Hogsback house falls down. Had been having difficulties with people and the place. But it was a house made from stone and brick, with wooden circular pillars every meter or so, and a large yellowish-orange pipe, almost like a paper mache kite/rice paper lampshade - except it was large and ran into the house from the one side above the ceiling. The pillars were made with semi-circular pieces of wood stacked to make a pillar.

We came back to watch each pillar slowly fall and detach itself from the wall. Then there was a moment before the pipe slowly collapsed. It was horrible. And we did not know what to do.

I woke up again with the need to take charge of my and Lyn's affairs. Of sorting out the insurances, and her finances. She will need to submit. No, more autonomy for her.

> PostNote: I never did manage to take charge of our affairs. She refuses to submit to this. So, she gained more autonomy, less freedom, and more difficulties.

## The Beast & The Angel (Poem)

In the bowels of the beast sleeps an angel
Tread lightly little one
Speak softly woman of the wild
Remove all your clothes.
You may enter His chamber naked
as the day you were born
for every covering
will He tear
from your tremulous grip.

Kneel.
Eyes downcast, naked breasts shining,
legs spread, offering Him access
to your most secret places.
Breathe deeply,
even though your heart might be fluttering.
Is it fear or is it excitement?
Breathe again.
As you feel His attention
focusing on you
your body
begins to melt.  
It awakens
to meet the energy
flowing over it,
nipples rising and
a slight shiver
running up and down your spine.
Knowing that the only weapon
you have
to subdue the beast is buried
deep in the core
of your womanhood.
Only when he has torn away
all of its coverings
laid you bare,
will He allow you close.
The sudden first touch sears you
and you gasp.
Quiet little one.
Breathe again.
It is just the start.

## This is the way i look at it. (m&f)

It is about spending time in sacred space. Because it is only there you can encounter your beloved. Think of it as Her boudoir.

Beware if you encounter Her or any of her angels anywhere else for that will then herald a cataclysmic, life changing event, a '_Hineni_' moment.

Women can do that anywhere, not needing much to open those gates. Men need direction and protocols. They need daily practice, preferably following a certain routine. Women are naturally timekeepers as they have their built in clocks. Men need rituals and nature to remind them. Unfortunately they can also be used to bind them.

But that is essentially why a lot of the rituals are man made. It is often a struggle for the man to be uplifted by the feminine form of the ritual, yet more often than not the women can be uplifted by the male form.

That is why it is as a reward that the soul is born as woman. She has an innate connection with the Divine, which she can deny, with its associated results - which is a whole discussion on its own. She is often called to selfless service like a _bhodisattva_.

In this time of flux, the women are at the forefront of the emerging structure. However this may be because few men are stepping forward to lead for in her heart this is what she truly desires - so that she may continue providing her loving care to those around her. _Eshet chayal_, we call her - the woman warrior.

As the groups became bound more to protocols, they lost the connection between the rituals as an expression of natural cycles, and they became an expression of the structure of the communities instead. Constantly available light is one of the obvious examples of this, providing us a space totally removed from the darkness surrounding us. It is perhaps our fear of death that propels us in this direction as it provides us with the incentive to excel, to be remembered and thus become immortalized...
