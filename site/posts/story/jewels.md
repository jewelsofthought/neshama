> As soon as a the perception of a new space, or the possibility thereof, is discovered by/in human consciousness, there will always be those who will be drawn to explore that space - no matter the possible consequences, especially if it becomes the goal of a powerful man - or the obsession of one less so.

## Story

There was a king who lived in a far away land. This king ruled over the whole world. He ruled over everything in it, from the tiniest insect to the behemoth. He ruled over the fire and the water, the winds and even the very breath that we breath. This king ruled for a long, long time. Long before there was even history.

There was ease and peace in his kingdom. His subjects all loved him dearly. They sang his praises constantly, and loved nothing more than regaling his wondrous deeds. The king himself was at peace. He had succeeded in his goal of bringing stability and prosperity to all his subjects.

## _Chirabah_ - (abyss)

[Chirabah](abyss.html)

As a young man, the prince had undergone the most rigorous training in all the sciences and arts both of the apparent and the hidden. In order to claim the title of king he had to pass through the abyss of _Chirabah_, and return with the gift that he would receive, if he survived.

> He surrounded His Spirit in a precious crystal, so that it could still communicate with the faraway. We call these crystals jewels, or gems. However, each one of these jewels were so precious, that they were each given their own very special vessel with which to be kept safe - so that He could continue to communicate with all his subjects.

Each one of these gems was like a radio. It could transmit and receive broadcasts. Just like our radio, where we have a big transmitter from which we broadcast over a large area, and each one of the crystals in your little radio receives the signal and transmits to the radio. For now, we have to be satisfied with the simple crystal and translate it to electricity ourselves.

Although I could easily imagine a crystal that receives light and transmits electricity... [chlorophyll](chlorophyll.html). Thus so far, we have only managed to find this occurring in organic molecules... which means living molecules, that respond to external influences. There are some that respond only to light.

> Each one of these jewels were so precious to him, for he had imbued each one with some of his very essence, and thus each one contained something of his will. [magician](magician.html) In order to keep them safe, he decided to fashion a vessel in which to hold it. This vessel would be made from the strongest, and densest material that his scientists could imagine and his artisans could fashion. Once that was done, he began to place each one of these precious jewels in the container that they had fashioned. "In their image, they created him".

The one promise he swore to each one of these jewels, was that he would never stop communicating with any one of them. He would maintain contact with each and every one of them...

He did not anticipate the problem being that any might chose ever to not want this communication. And having to become in order to create the vessels, he suffered the very aspects that he'd used to fashion his vessels - hurt and anger. How could they?

## Descent

> We do not "gain" consciousness here. We enter as fully conscious beings. We are not here to pay off some ancient or ancestral debt, though we might have come here to complete an ancestral mission.
> Nor are we born in some debt to some overlord, divine or not. We are here because we asked to be here, or were chosen. We had to train for many years, to be able and willing to step down from a higher, more encompassing viewpoint into this constricting and challenging place.

Each child is born with one of these precious jewels. In times past we called it a blessing from G-d, or the kiss of an angel.

At birth that jewel is pure, and shines brightly. As the vessel grows larger, it needs more nourishment from its surroundings, and thus its appetite for the energy of the material that it exists in, from which it has been fashioned, increases.

Thus the jewels becomes encrusted with the barnacles of life. Through the inputs of parents, siblings, teachers, and all those who wield power over these jewels &ndash; who actually have been tasked with the honour of keeping them safe and clean &ndash; the outer covering becomes encrusted, separating the nut from its shell, or the jewels from its vessel.

Now the messages that are being relayed through the jewel cannot penetrate this thickening outer layer, like a hard skin that surrounds the juicy nut. So it vibrates in the inner chamber of the vessel, but only the inner layers respond.

In addition, any transmissions from the outside are being intercepted by this shell that has formed around the jewel. Thus those messages from outside that the jewel&mdash;which responds to energy and frequency&mdash;receives are being affected by both the harmonics of the shell and the inner harmonics of the jewel that cannot penetrate the shell &ndash; and are being reflected and refracted in the inner chamber in which the jewel resides.

Let's take a closer look at what is happening here. I am simplifying it, because there are details that I am glossing over. But bear with me, and hopefully you will get the picture.

Imagine a jewel that is vibrating in a chamber, and these vibrations, though dampened, are sending out certain frequencies&ndash; which have nowhere to go. These vibrating in the chamber itself will begin to resonate, both harmonically and disharmonically. Eventually, the information will become so confusing, being impossible to differentiate between those messages that are coming from the jewels itself and those that are produced as a result of the internal noise that is continuously reverberating in the chamber itself. In addition, these extraneous frequencies and sounds would interfere with any information that is being received or being transmitted.

To put it more simply, the source of the messages now being received are not all valid. Some are internally generated, and will often result in recursion.

Another effect is the influence of all the noise in the chamber, both positive and negative, on the stream of messages being received.

Before continuing, we have to ask a pertinent question here. Where is the information that is being received by this jewel being transmitted to? A certain amount is the feedback to keep the shell functioning properly. The rest ... well back along the channel that is receiving from faraway, not from the shell surrounding it.

Now that ends up at the receiving station, where something looks at the message, and has to decide where to deliver it. If it is a good message, it goes into the G-d stream. If it is a bad message, it goes to those who deal with bad messages. Which will depend on how bad it is.

To take it one step further. What will the information that will be now transmitted to the jewel from the station? The general broadcast will continue, but now the messages you receive will be influenced by the responses to the messages you sent up the pike...

A analogy of this kind of behaviour is the spam protection that is necessary for the email system to function. If the message is good, it is received by the recipient. If the message is not good it is placed in a spam queue to be looked at unless it is already recognised, thereupon it is "trashed". To continue the trash metaphor &ndash; in the real world, something has to pick up or clear the trash. This is one who actually feeds on this trash, as is nature's wont, and becomes more powerful the more trash it receives. In nature no energy is wasted &ndash; she has created something that will be nourished by whatever energy is produced. If it is rotten, there are beings that will devour it. The more rotten, the more the particular parasites that munch that trash will appear and multiply.

## Purpose

I am not going to say to anyone ever that I "know" what the purpose of our existence is. But there is little doubt that the best thing you can do in your life is keep that jewel clean. It will guide you, and comfort you. It will help you change your life.

How do I keep it clean, you may ask? Well, you may be surprised to know that there are many manuals that describe how to do that. What you need to learn (or be taught) is to differentiate between those that lead you astray&ndash;in order to harvest your energy &ndash;and those that teach the correct path.

However, before I mention some of them, I have to warn you. This is not about book learning. You cannot lean how to make love from a book. This requires hard work, determination, commitment, and more hard work. It is a lifelong pursuit that you have to follow in everything you do and say and eventually even think.

## Living guide

For without a living guide, one cannot unlock the secrets in any of these manuals. As it is said, "G-d hides in this world". Only the true seeker will find the jewels.

"That's sounds awefully like brainwashing", you respond querulously.

Of course it is. I say gaily. There is only one way to wake someone up from a trance, and that is to rewire his perception of the world. The only way to do that is to "rewire" his brain. Wash out the nonsense that has stained his mind.

Or if you just wish to control him, fill his head with nonsense, confusing him, and then provide him with the Solution.

The only difference is that this brainwashing is describing the path to God.

"Well, alright already. Speak to me of this path."

Before I do that, I have to explain to you that this narrative I am building has a number of levels. We cannot begin at the top level because we are unsure of where it is. We have to start at the bottom, at the beginning, so as to say. And, the beginning of course is represented by the the first, which we often represent by the number I (one).

However, this I persists. It never goes away. Thus the basic fundamental principle, that has to be engraved on your heart, your mind and your soul, is the fact that "[All Is One](shma.html)".

Every practice will have this at its core. The _Shma_ in Judaism, the _Om_ in Hinduism, the _Tao_ in Taoism... etc. It acknowledges the fundamental principle that everything comes from the One &ndash; and is just an expression thereof, derived therefrom.

_This is a introduction to the pieces on infinity, the beginning (creation), and one._

He looked down at the earnest faces in front of him...

It had been a long journey to this place to meet and find this man hidden in the mountains of Africa.

Lying there in my cocoon of bliss, one year old, I could see them leaning over the crib I was lying in. I did not recognise their shapes yet, just the energetics of our relationships. I was the centre and they were like electrons orbiting around the nucleus, like the interactions of atoms forming a molecule of existence. One could call it the DNA of our spiritual existence&mdash;the template that you are born with&mdash;rich or poor, surrounded by siblings or a single child to a single mum; parents who are happy or depressed, loving or violent, caring or distant, abusive or kind...

Often when they leaned over me a worm-like tentacle would emerge and reach down towards me. It was filled with fear, as they were worried about me&mdash;whether I would live or I would die. But, for me, there was no distinction. I was just here, lying around, unable to sit up, reacting to what was around me, unable to move away. Everything reverberated with its sensations&mdash;whether hard or soft, slow or fast, loud or quiet&mdash;so many new feelings surrounding me.

When I needed to cough, I coughed and when it was over, it was done. My only need was food and love and a safe space to be.

Is that when it began?

Although I could not understand their words, I could see them, as Yogananda said, "All babies are born with the capacity to speak any language on earth. I was born with the knowledge of all languages. Slowly, I had to learn that my parents only understood a specific language. I had to constrain myself in order to communicate with them."

{I think it is not that they baby has knowledge of all languages. He has the ability to speak any one, if taught. But he does come in to life knowing a root language, what one might call the Divine language of existence.

Those around me, I perceived/saw as vibrational patterns or crystals that formed shapes. I could tell by their nature what energy or intention they carried.

This is the creation of the vessel, the chariot, the construction that you will be shaped from and by throughout your life.

The goal is for each one of us to re-pattern ourselves. It is referred to as redemption, חוזר בצובה, returning to the source through the process of first atonement then "atunement". This is done by passing through the three levels of forgiveness, till gratitude is all that remains.

This will require a change. If you want your life to change, first change yourself. The Holy One, blessed be He, will not change.

In my bubble, or womb, of light, I had no fear. I was still aware of and connected to the Light. I was clean and pure, and thus radiated that image of Divine, that is spoken of in Genesis. Every morning, I am reminded of this. <b>אלוהים, הנפשׁ שׁנתתה בי, תהוּרה. </b>
