## The Journey Begins

<div class="poem">

### Journey to Infinity

Cartwheels within cartwheels,
Spinning head over heals,
Seeking vortices that will heal
While journeying between the two worlds,
this one and that one.

Rich, inner lives that can
Nourish us, creativity arising
From within, a deep-dark
Place, a place of the night,
Where the primordial waters lap.

This is the font of our inner richness
Without which seekers become
Architects, building the constraints,
The _Gevurah_ of space and time.

Afraid of the aloneness,
We fill the it
With our plaintive cries.
Our own voices echoing in that incessant
inner dialogue.

We can only hear ourselves.

That is loneliness.

A single tiny light, hovering, a candle-flame,
In an infinity of darkness.

Only in a void can _Ein Soph_ write.
Only in a completely and
Absolutely empty space can Her
Voice be heard, singing, singing all of Creation
Into existence.

Otherwise it is jagged,
incoherent and discontinuous,
disturbed by whatever noise
is disturbing it.

To be surrounded by God,
is to be surrounded by an infinity
of nothingness.
Yet
how is it that I can find You
in this endless nothingness?
How can You exist by my side,
be of me
yet separate from me?
How can I love some One else?
Is it not all reflections?
Just creations of my own,
images in the speculum
that surrounds me?

How dismal.
How awesome.

In the Divine Realm of Infinity,
time and space have no
Meaning,
so a movement
can be forever,
And an infinite distance
is the same as You
being
right beside me.

</div>

**Breathe, breathe in, breathe out. Breathe.**

Every breath changes everything.

All is interconnected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move one iota and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The configuration of the whole
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universe changes.

### The Descent

<div class="poem">

**Descend** with me into my dungeon.
It is a journey I want you to take with me.
In my dungeon is a scared[^1] me
that has been wounded and scarred.

Help free her,
lead her out of the darkness and into the light.
That she may take her place
besides the other angels,
and play happily with my other children.
All safe, all joyful – expressing themselves,
working for the greater gift of All.[^2]

</div>

### Science

It is time for the truth to emerge out of the paradigm that only sees form into the mysterious spaces of the realms that we so fear. It is inevitable &mdash; as surely as the sun rises and the seasons come. Even though it is the space of your deep denial,  the writing is on the wall &mdash; the evidence is incontrovertible.

Already compartmentalized by the rational constraints imposed by the requirement of empericism which can only function in a closed field. The concept that only by investigating, even acknowledging, a limited, essentially tiny, amount of the totality can produce better results &mdash; that is, by relying on the empirical "facts" alone.[^3]

Only in a limited sense are these facts "true". They are not absolute truths; they are relative objects whose birth is related to the time, place and culture that they are first described in.

> Breathe in, breathe out (x3)

#### Atoms & Molecules

The priests of society are the keepers of the great myths of your time – the creation myth, the dying story, why events occur or don't occur, disease, and pain, etc. They have taken the role of prophets, predicting events before they occur. And, taking guidance from G-d's book, unless you obey the prophecy, there will be severe consequences &mdash; true or not.

They have convinced us, just like the priest of yore, that their narrative of creation is the correct one. No longer is it a glorious battle between mysterious, unfathomable cosmic forces, sometimes called angels, sometimes gods. It has become a random "big bang", like an orgasmic explosion, that brought the universe into being. Then, not guided, nor directed by any ineffable will or consciousness, just happened to order itself into a functioning and living universe &mdash; that is despite all the incredible evidence for the absolute statistical unlikelihood of any of this occurring.

They tell that all matter is made up of elements, which consist of atoms, each a different combination of just three particles &mdash; electrons, protons and neutrons. All nicely prepared and packaged for our consumption. Then we discovered that these fundamental elements are made up of even more mysterious "particles" that behave like waves too. And this introduces a whole world of strange effects populated by somethings that are so small it is beyond your imagination as to their size. Just to give you an example, light, which is the fastest thing we know, travels just 3 feet in one nanosecond &mdash; the time unit we use to measure these entities. So try to imagine how small a nanometer (1 * 10<sup>-9</sup> meters) is.

How these strange fellows, who contradict many of our basic physical laws, managed to get together and compose atoms and elements, and all the other "real" objects, both living and non-living, in our existence is an still an existential mystery.

I mean, even though we speak of atoms being the elements that make up all the objects in the universe, it is acknowledged that 99% of the atom is "empty". In addition, the universe is made up of mostly dark matter and energy and, just like Africa was "darK" for many years, it is dark energy because it is unknown. We have no idea what it is!

Just as we believe in these atoms form molecules from which everything is made, there are also things, called germs, that make us sick. And this is after they have convinced us that that the universe could is finite, and started with a "big bang" &mdash; a ludicrously childish name for Creation of our world.

You believe this, bolstered by your faith in a rational and logical process, nourished by the need to have basic elements of existence that you can verify. You believe in your myths, just as the ancients believed in their stories of creation. These myths, born prior to your science, permeate and pollute our structures, providing meaning to our lives and the things we do.

This mythology of our time tells us that these atoms are made up of particles. In the end the mystery of numbers and their equations, produced a mythical equation that tells us that matter and energy are the same thing. From this, we understand that there is no thing, for its mass, its density, its "factual" reality, particles, are just energy &mdash; and somehow light plays a part in this manifestation. As expressed in the famous equation: $$ e = mc^2 $$ which says that all energy is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by the speed of light squared. If you meditate on this a moment, you might be struck by the fact that a) light plays a part in this equation, and b) that it is in fact not light itself, but its movement, its speed, that is used in the calculation!

You are surrounded by your perceptions &mdash; what you "see", what you "hear", what you "smell", what you "taste", what you "feel", what you "think", and even what you "desire" &mdash; all are vibrational (energetic)in their essence. That is almost like saying that they are perceivable because of their movement, which almost "defines" who they are to us.

Those who are more insightful might point out that there are static objects in our world, object that do not move. Their movement is contained. It has achieved a kind of dynamic balance that holds their "shape". But, do not be fooled, they are in constant motion. These  atoms &mdash; and especially the so-called sub-atomic "particles" that they consist of &mdash; are internally in constant motion. A mountain, which looks eternal, is in constant motion. Earth moves, trees grow and fall, rocks tumble, etc. Even the table at which you sit is not truly static, but is just maintaining its perceived structure until entropy, the natural movement to chaos, takes over and it will begin to rot or splinter and slowly fall apart.

> Breathe in, breathe out (x3)

Imagine all those atoms and molecules, those billions and trillions of little 'things' entering your body. All bunched together as the dust, bacteria, dead skin, etc, surrounding you, floating in the "air". All the incredible array of substances and clusters of things entering your bodies from your surroundings.

Are we really separate from this primordial soup that encloses, even defines, us? In order to define who we are, from the physical to the spiritual, we are enclosed in the sound of Other. It is the one melody, the one breath that gives the choir voice. Like the microwave frequency that exists throughout the universe, it is the one Voice (perhaps the only voice) that sings the symphony of Creation.

One could say, that we are continuing this process of creation by singing ourselves into being, just as God's infinite voice brings the whole of creation into existence.

### Breathing

> Breathe in, slowly

Your surroundings are affected by your removal of those elements  that you have breathed in. Changing and affecting everything around (and inside) you.

> Hold your breath

 Feel this air and its energy spreading in your body, nourishing and feeding it with its light energy, disturbing and interrupting its processes with its dark energy. Notice how it affects your body. As this is occurring, notice how the air in your lungs is now changing, filling up with the waste from your body. You have changed it, affected it, transformed it by placing your "stuff" in it, having removed what you wanted, and affected it with your emotions and mental state of mind.

> Breathe out, slowly

However, upon exiting, it contains information about you, all that you had inside of you, has now breathed out. A little bit of you is in that air.

> Breathe in, slowly

Now, as this air as it enters your body, say a little prayer:
"Thank you, O Lord, for this nourishing air that enters my body. I am blessed and blessed by my ability to breathe it easily. I am grateful for all the gifts and blessing it contains. And I ask for protection from all the toxins and bad energies that it may contain. May I be forgiven for my sins, and protected from harm. My prayer is to receive these blessings and lessons with grace."

> Hold your breath

Once again, feel it spreading through your body. Be as aware of this as you can. Bless it as it enters your blood and nourishes your cells. Bless it as it collects all the detritus from the work that is being done in your body to keep it hale and healthy. Welcome the change in your lungs. And when they tell you it is time to release...

> Breathe out, slowly

Putting your own blessing into this air, as you breathe it out. Imagine your light, your gratitude, your love in that air as you breathe it out, placing lovingkindness into the space that surrounds you. How will the universe react?

> Continue this for another five breaths...
> Breathe in slowly; hold your breath; breathe out slowly (x5)

The Other entering and leaving transformed by your very existence. The air around you dances with you all the time, in and out and around, every day of your life.

We are in constant dialogue with the universe around us.

Now remember to bless the air you breathe.

## Infinity & Zero

### What is infinity - Exercise

In order for us to envisage infinity, let us imagine an infinite line. A line that has no beginning and no end. That, in itself, might be a stretch of the imagination, but could we try and experience this infinite line?

Let us try. But first we need a starting point. As the line is infinite, we can choose any point[^6] from it. We can call it the "point of origin".

Instead of a goal, instead of imagining something else, or some other place, remember this point of origin, 0, zero.[^7]

Remain at that beginning point a moment. Settle there, become familiar with it. Make sure you kNow where it is. Make sure it is secure and will remain fixed. When you have succeeded in doing that, now being to move from that point, slowly, along this line. Continue moving, keeping on the track, while remaining tethered to the place of origin, the beginning.

After a time of travelling along this line, you may notice that your movement has become faster as you cover more distance. At a certain moment, you will feel this line that stretches  between you and your starting point begin to tighten, like an rubber band that is being stretched tight.

You are close to your end point. A word of caution, do not cross over that boundary, for once the chord is broken, you may not be able to return.[^8]

But beyond that point (or line) that demarcates your limit, is where infinity &mdash; in our experience &mdash; begins. This is what it means for a line to be infinite. It is a line that we cannot even imagine, though we can describe it as being endless &mdash; a state contradicting everything in our experience; or as having no beginning and no end, but we cannot envisage that.[^9]

Spend as much time at your limit as you wish, but do not be careless. When you are done, please return...

## Consciousness

### I Axiom of Existence

The first premise is that there is something that exists&mdash;call it **consciousness**.

>Every form must be aware of itself to be able to maintain said form.

From that we derive that there has to be a **differentiation** of some sort, an otherness. For anything to exist, for anything to be recognizable, to have an identity, it needs to be, in some way, different from its surroundings. Which presupposes some sort of recognisable difference. A this and a that.

There is only one state that could exist as a "precursor" to this process of differentiation, and that is one of absolute Unity, Perfection and Balance. Where everything is One and the same, no other. That is the only state that this realm of differentiation could have arisen from. So, even if this realm of measurement is infinite, it is still only a part of the Realm of Perfection, and a subset thereof.

However, perhaps this subset is in fact an integral part of the Perfection. For sublime perfection would contain both that which is perfection and that which is not. And if the imperfection is only a subset of the Perfection, perhaps the Perfection is still perfect in its totality. In addition, perhaps this so-called imperfection is only a perception of the imperfect's view of the Perfect.

Could not the Realm of Perfection be a subset of the Realm of Chaos?

The answer is no, because the Realm of Perfection has no differentiations. All is One, all is in balance.

This segway into the what is chaos and what is order. The finite view of perfection is to maintain stasis, even if dynamic within the vicitudes of its existence. Whereas the infinite has no need to maintain anything, and thus, in the finite, represents chaos, and annihilation of the order in which it maintains itself. Whereas to the infinite, order is the expression of the infinite constraining and restricting itself to a very limited piece of itself.

### Point

> It takes an infinite amount of nothing to create something. So we are a finite collection of infinities.

Each "point" requires an infinite amount of energy to manifest. Thus each point is defined by an infinite amount of the no-thing-ness, of whatever is NOT (a point).

In the beginning there was nothing, and nothing "moved". It is the infinite process of the infinite constraining itself. It is as if a quality, a certain aspect of infinity was held back, was removed.[^10]

This collection of infinities, we call _Atzilut_, the highest level, for beyond this, there is nothing.

### Self

#### Awareness of Self

Now, in this realm of events,

> there exists at least one element that is aware of its own existence

The only way to know this awareness is to communicate it. Once this communication protocol has been agreed upon, one can test the veracity of one's experience. Naturally, one would be drawn to those with similar views, and thus we form a kind of consensual reality that is always an approximation of reality. The \(r\)evolutionary step here is not to increase communication amongst our species, but to increase our capacity for "inter-species" communication. Not just between the different cultures and languages of our world, something we have not succeeded in too well &ndash; but between us and the animals, between humans and the fauna and flora of our world. Then, perhaps we will be able to begin to communicate with otherworldly beings.

### Communication of self

Probably all living things are aware of their existence, but few are able to make some external representation of that awareness. We, as humans, have been gifted with the ability to communicate our inner thoughts to one another in a mostly meaningful manner.

Which brings us to the gift of speech, which the sages say differentiates us from the animals. I would express it in a more modern manner, by saying that the ability to communicate, to express myself in meaningful ways, is the differentiation. It requires, at its core, some self-aware element that would be the source of this communication&mdash;the purpose thereof.

Could one include the response of an (AI) method to a request? That would require one to speak of primary and secondary sources, and bring the debate into the area of intention or overrarching goal. For instance, is the respone of a teller in a bank the source of the message being conveyed, or is the banking system? Then again, is the banking the true source, or is it just a part of an even larger dialogue?{.note}

In order to be able to communicate, or to propose the concept of communication, at least two elements are necessary for this to occur. In fact, it requires far more than two elements for a communication system to become functional.

Thus the conclusion is that there are a certain number of these elements—let's say N elements&mdash;which is the minimum amount required in order for a method of communication to emerge.

I would propose that is different for verbal communication (ʋ) than for written (ѡ) communication. If that is true, then it would make sense that ѡ > Nʋ. Where '>' or 'greater than', would mean requiring more complexity and thus, in most cases, a larger pool of elements. It is known that something like 90% of words in the English language are hardly ever used in the spoken language.{.note}

Consider then, that the complexity and pervasiveness of the communication systems we have at present requires a significant proportion of the current population to exist.

Just imagine if all sentient beings on this planet were communicating. What an incredible event.[^11]

### Other

### Awareness of Other

The interesting paradox of this "self-awareness" is that there has to be an "other" that is aware of itself. Or something which is not that which it is aware of. There has to be a separation of some nature between the being and whatever in the being that is conscious of itself—conscious enough to be able to represent itself.

This is based on the fact that in order for something to exist, there has to be something else that is not that which exists. A separation. Simply, for a fish to exist in the ocean, it cannot be water. One could say that there needs to be three elements – the "thing" itself, the border or skin that defines/contains the thing, and the outside that is separate from the contained "thing".

This, combined with the ability to communicate coherently to one another, brings greater awareness of self and of other. Now the journey truly begins.

<div class="note" class="is-hidden">

  <b>Malchut</b>: First step: establish the ego, one's kingship in this world (ego).
  
  <b>Yesod</b>: Once your foundation in the world is well rooted, the next step is to develop a strong foundation in your own self. It is not a foundation that should anchor you even more in the world, but a foundation upon which you can begin the journey (of two legs) to the world that awaits us all.
  This can only occur by having a strong enough personal foundation to be able to find balance and harmony between the duality of self and other through both personal and community service. This nourishes both the particular and the general, the immanent and transcendent, opening up the gate to one's higher I, and the beauty and splendour of your (and other's) being.
  
  <b>Netzach</b> & <b>Hod</b>: This awareness is based made up of two elements. One that is "involuntary", in that it just "perceives". The other is that the being has the ability to "receive" and cognite his (or her) experience. It is made up of the innate aspects of life, and the particular, individual apprehension of that experience, which is unique to the person.

</div>

## II Axiom of Choice

Knowing of the existence of something, I[^4] can suggest the existence of a non-empty set, a set that is different from the empty set. Let us refer to it as the set of nothingness, as it had nothing in it prior to the arising of existence. It is a set that is distinct from this element of existence.

> There exists a set that has discrete elements in it, one of which can be chosen.

Thus we arrive at the Axiom of Choice, which says that we can basically choose any place as our point of origin. Any place, as our beginning. Which requires the Axiom of Existence, which proposes existence of something.

Imagine a collection of baskets, each of which are non-empty. What the axiom of choice then says is that we can choose a member from any basket in that collection. This is an expression of free will. We have a choice, and through these choices we create our future. This path is one's golden thread, around what one may call one's vector of existence, and is often referred to as one's personal narrative.

<details>
  <summary class='button is-small is-rounded is-danger'>
  delete &nbsp;<i class='fa fa-close'></i>
</summary>
<p>
Beginning with the fact that something exists, something that we can even call the null (or empty) set, the set that contains nothing. If there is such a non-element, then immediately, from the 'that', we deduce a 'this', from the &#x2205; we have a 'not-&#x2205;' or a non-empty set. Because if there is a nothing from which everything arose, and there is a something (by the very fact of my own existence, as well as the existence of everything around me &mdash;probably necessary for my very existence)
</p><p>
This adds another characteristic to the set of elements that we have proposed, and that is one of **activity**, a dynamic, allowing for a recognizable change of state.
</p>
</details>

## III Axiom of Relationship

Now this thing, different from the no-thing-ness that it emerged from, will undergo a change of state. First, in its emergence from the perfect nothingness, and secondly, in that it is a finite thing, and thus goes through the cycle of existence.

This adds another characteristic to these objects of existence and that is one of **activity**, a dynamic, allowing for a manifest change of state. Recognizing this "motion" in the dynamics of existence, means that they two elements have a relationship.

Let's refer to this object as I, or one. For the I to have any meaning, it must recognise itself as different from its surroundings. Yet if the surroundings cannot support its existence, it will not survive. Thus there is an almost symbiotic relationship between the object and its surroundings &mdash; even if only surrounded by "nothing".

If there is one I, there is very likely to be another that the I recognises. In fact, there are a possibly infinite amount of elements in the universe that we can recognise. In order to exist, the original I is in constant relation with its surroundings and the objects in its environment, otherwise I will not be able to recognise any change of state.

Now, having identified at least one thing, we can assume that there is more than just that one object. In fact, we have discovered there are large, perhaps infinite, collections of objects and things in our world.

Before we can investigate the dynamics, i.e., as a change of state, that might exist between any of the elements chosen, there has to be a "relationship" of some sort between them in order to be able to recognize a change of state. For the dynamic present to have any meaning to the _'I'_, that we have proposed, _'I'_ have to have some sort of relationship with this dynamic, otherwise _'I'_ will not be able to identify any change in the state.

By the removal of _'I'_ then, a space, a vacuum, nothingness has entered.

If there is an element that is able to occupy _'I_'s vacated space, '_not-I'_, or _'~I'_, that presupposes either an infinite amount of elements in this space, or the ability to produce any amount of elements at any time as needed.

Now we have number of characteristics of our space:

> 1. That something exists within it.
> 2. That there is more than a single element in this set.
> 3. That it can undergo a change of state.
> 4. That they relate to one another.

### Dust to dust

A question that arises here is whether the emergence _ex-nihilo_ occurred at one single point (ala Big Bang Theory) or whether it occurred at multiple, perhaps infinite places and whether it occurred in the same moment or whether it "unfolded" over time (ala Inflation Theory).

Then there is the question of the "disappearance" or "appearance" of these invisible "particles". Where does it go?

On the one hand, a characteristic of infinity is that even if you remove a heck of a lot of infinity from infinity, it is still infinite. If there is a change of state within this infinity, then so has it's infinite collection of finite events. It, all of it, will have changed. Though it would require an observer, a witness, to notice it.

Let us choose an object, or set, that we designate  _'I'_ that exists in the universe _'U'_ (1). We propose that _'I'_ has an exact, equal and opposite _'not-I'_, represented by _'-I'_ (2). That is, the two are equal, except for the fact that _'-I'_ is the negative or symmetrical reflection to _'I'_. Now we can also propose _'~I'_ which is different from _'-I'_ (3). Whereas _'-I'_ is the exact opposite, or reflection, of _'I'_, _'~I'_ is all that _'I'_ am not, and, unless we are working in a finite space, is, to all intents and purposes, infinite

<details>
<summary class='button is-outlined is-warning is-small is-rounded'>
Mathematics&nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>
</summary>

We say that given the set _'I'_, is an element of the universal set _'U'_:

(i) &nbsp; $\textstyle{I \in U}$ .
2. &nbsp;$$ \forall{I} \in U, \exists{-I} \in U $$, such that $$ I \cap -I = &#x2205; $$ and $$ I - (-I) = &#x2205; $$ &mdash; written simply as $$ I - I = &#x2205; $$.
3. &nbsp;We also define &#x223d;$$I \in U $$, such that $$ U - I = &#x223d;I $$

</p>

<b>Discussion</b>

<p>
If we exist in an infinite universe $$U$$, and if $$I$$ is finite, surrounded by $$U$$, then '&#x223d;$$I$$' must be, in effect, infinite – that is unless you believe that we live in a finite universe. Assuming the universe to be infinite, even if $$I$$ is infinite, then '&#x223d;$$I$$' must also be infinite &mdash; though presumably a greater infinity than that of '$$I$$'. This might get a little deep for the average reader, but we know that $$ U > I $$ then $$ &#x223d;I > I $$. Remember, we are talking about infinities in this case. For if $$I$$ is finite, then it is a no-brainer. Finally, if $$ 'I' \equiv&nbsp;'&#x223d;I' $$, then it defines the middle, for $$'I'$$ and &nbsp; $$ '&#x223d;I' $$ are then equal.
</p>
</details>
<p>
From the point of view of the $$'I'$$, $$'I'$$ defines both '&#x223d;$$I$$' and $$'I'$$. Perhaps the truth is that '&#x223d;$$I$$' is the one that defines the $$'I'$$, that holds the boundaries, the limits, of what $$'I'$$ am. The original ocean was one of not-ness, in which the '$$I$$' that I am, appeared. In order for '$$I$$' to appear, there had to be a space '&#x223d;$$I$$' in which I could appear. The moment that '&#x223d;$$I$$' appeared, the '$$I$$' could emerge, and thus the '$$-I$$', which is the "shadow" or anti-form emerged as well. This is based on the principle that every element in the quantum space has a reflection, an anti-particle, that is "equal but opposite". That '$$I$$', which is not '&#x223d;$$I$$', appears as a consequence, a space, a 'place', within the Infinite. Somethingness has emerged from Nothingness.
</p>

Think of this in terms of a circle that I draw in the sand. It defines three structures, the one that is inside the circle, the circle's boundary itself, and the space outside the circle.

This is corroborated by the Kabbalistic doctrine of the Constraint, or _Tzimtzum_. the process of the eternal nothingness, _Ain Sof_, removing itself to make space for Creation. It was necessary for the Infinite Light to constrain Itself so that Creation could emerge.

From the principle of the Reality of One, in which the only reality is the One, I see that '$$I$$' am different. In order for me to recognize or relate to anything else in the universe, there must be other '$$I$$'s &mdash; or somethings that are not the One.

Thus we derive the Axiom of Relationship.

### Axiom of Relationship

If we propose two points, A & B, and both are static, then whatever connection there exists, will be static too. Although the channel that connects them might be dynamic, the conduit remains the same "length". There is also a ~A, or not-A, in which B exists.

<p>
There is the concept of a Universe, U, consisting of A &#x222a; ~A. A requirement is also that A & B are disjoint or A &#x2229; B = &#x2205;. In other words they are completely separate and there is no element/part of A that is in B, and vice-versa.
</details>
<p>
Now, if B happens to move&mdash;still remaining disjoint from A&mdash;it will move in A's not-space, ~A. Although A has not changed, ~A&mdash;which includes the space which B vacated&mdash;has changed! In addition, ~B&mdash;the space which B vacated&mdash;has changed too! In fact, the whole universe is now different – and we have no means with which to ever measure that. Our sages say: "The very act of measuring changes what is being measured," bolstered by the information that quantum mechanics has reached concerning the influence of an observer on the event.

The conclusion from all of this that "It is all connected." If we see things as disjoint, or separate, it is because we do not have the ability to see all the connections that are there.

Think of it as in huge, complex chess game, what Herman Hesse called 'The Glass Bead Game'. You move one piece. The whole game changes. The whole game.

## Axiom of Balance

> If something is removed, the space will be filled.

This emptiness, or the '&#x223d;$$I$$', desires to fill the whole universe&mdash;and it will eventually&mdash;unless the universe is infinite, for then it will be an infinite quest. We express it in popular science as 'nature abhors a vacuum'. It is always seeking balance, which is a zero-energy state&mdash;or the true state of Nothingness.

Starting from the axiom of existence, something, let's call it I, exists. If I is finite, then there is ~I that is all that I is not, and thus will be Infinite. This is of course based on the assumption that the totality of everything is infinite.

Having let the "infinite" cat out of the bag, there is no going back. Once, having conceived of infinity, we cannot but know that surrounding every finite being, there must be an infinite "beingness" or "not-beingness", if you prefer.

> Nothing infinite exists

For if it exists, it must be finite. It must have had a beginning and, else it could not exist. And thus, it must have an end too.Everything that exists must have been the result of some sort of constraint upon infinity. If it exists, it must, by definition, then be finite.

Now, I ask, how, who or what recognized the finite? What part of the infinite was "trained" or "programmed" to be able to perceive itself as finite, when all it had know up till then was infinite? As finite beings, how can we know of the infinite unless we are part of an infinity?

Even though it might require an infinite constraint to constrain infinity for the finite to emerge, we find ourselves in a verbal landscape that is littered with paradoxes and contradictions when dealing with the infinite. For, what is infinity actually? Can one even speak of the finite without the concept of the infinite? Do they emerge together? Can the one exist without the other?

Assuming that there is more than one infinite element – or even an unknown amount – we then could have an infinite amount of infinities. For instance, even if we assume that there is a finite amount of stars in the universe, we do not know how many universes there are! Now, when dealing with simple events like numbers, We cannot say how many numbers there are on the number line, but we do know it is infinite.

<p>
The logic one would use in this case goes something like: "Choose a number, any number as large as you like. Call that number, $$N$$. Now we know that even if $$N$$ is humongous, there is a number greater than $$N$$, $$N+1$$, which we will call $$N\prime$$. We conclude that for any system, as long as we assume infinity exists, there is no finite system that is not contained within a larger, infinite system.
</p>
</details>

In the opposite direction it is more difficult. If there is only the infinite, how does the finite even emerge? For this infinite would not even be called infinite, but just Itself – for it would know of nothing else. Here I ask the question, does infinite only exist, or is derived from, the finite? In other words, only once the finite has somehow emerged, can one refer to the infinite!

### Infinite but bounded

#### Circle

We now introduce the concept of infinite but bounded. The simplest example of this concept is a circle. For one can continue along or around the circle forever, and never reach the end. Yet the space that you are creating by your path is bounded. Is that space finite or not? If you filling it with one-dimensional (1d) points would it eventually fill up? If one extended it to 3d, how many possibilities would emerge? What if it one extended it into other dimensions?

#### <i>Merkava</i>

  <figcaption>Tetrahedron</figcaption>
</figure>

This is where we begin to envisage the concept of the _Merkava_, as the double tetrahedron, or three-dimensional (3d) Star of David, that spins in the circle. It starts off with its apexes on the circumference of the circle. But it can shrink along either or both its axes, as well as swing around, filling and "defining" the space – but also setting up resonances in it, that may affect many things regarding its dynamics. It will affect the frequencies that it will be sending out, and those that it will be able to receive.

<figure style="float: right">

It is similar to a gyroscope in its effect. There is an inner balance that retains our _axis mundi_ upon which all other axes rely. If that gets damaged in any way, then we "lose our way". Sometimes it is just knocked off its axis, and needs a short while to rebalance. Other times it is actually damaged and needs repair. The cause of this damage is generally "stinking thinking".

As the circle approaches infinity, you would think that you are on an infinitely long line, and would not be able to differentiate.

Mathematics can show that at infinity a circle becomes a straight line (although it can only show this in the imaginary realm – as if mathematics has a "real" realm &ndash; it is easy to envisage it in the 2d realm too). If I was a giant from another planet, or had a strong telescope, I would be able to discern that it was actually a bounded circle upon which you are walking through time.

### Axiom of Relationship

> We need to connect infinity and nothingness at the same space-time point – which would require nothing less than pure consciousness.  As T.S. Eliot stated "a place of complete simplicity, costing not less than everything".

Once we have more than one element, we can begin to discuss the relationship between each of them.

The place we begin our journey to infinity is, strangely enough in the arms of nothing, the ultimate demise of infinity. For how can infinity know itself? Does it not need something finite to recognize itself? Something finite to contain the recognition, even of greater and lessor infinities?

As a starting place, we invoke the <b>Axiom of Existence</b>. This axiom says, simply, that something exists. That I believe we can all agree on.

Firstly we define our universe, U. This encompasses everything that is, was or will be and everything else. Beginning with something, let us say that there exists a set S in U. ~S is then defined as all elements in U that are not in S.

Beginning with something, S, then ø (the null set) is whatever remains after we have removed everything that was there. That is S – S = ø.

If we define S as the collection of all somethings in the universe, and we call the Universe U, then if we remove S from U, U – S, what are we left with? A universe, U, that is "something else" that contains no "somethings"?

A better way to look at it is, let U consist of S &#x222a; ~S, this would include everything and as S &#x2229; ~S = ø, we have arrived at the concept of the null set, the ultimate empty set.

If we remove both S & ~S from U, will we not also get an empty set? So, what we are left with is after we remove everything from the universe, it equals the emptiness. Bringing us to the conclusion that U is at its core the empty set.

We arrive at one of the core questions of humanity, the mystery of creation. How is it that out of nothing came something? How can something exist in nothing? _Ex nihilo_, ø – the empty set, nothingness?

First we need to agree on the existence of ø, the empty set or nothing.

### Individual(ized)

Here '+' is the expansive (positive or light) side, and '–' is the contractive (negative, dark or shadow) side. We could also think of it as 'I', and '–I', where 'I' represents the external, or positive, individuation, and the '–I' the internal, or negative, individuation.

### **רצון התוב ורצון הרא** &mdash; The good impulse and the bad impulse

Becoming esoteric,  two wrongs cancel one another out, but do not make it right! In fact, to express it more humanely, we could say that when in error, you need another asymmetry, something unexpected, to correct the journey, by countering the first. It is only through the negation of the negative that we can find the positive. This is the principle of non-rationality.

The concept of sin (_chet_) in Judaism is described as missing the mark. Somethin that requires constant readjustment and practice till the target can be attained with some degree of accuracy.

If we apply force, that is intention. With clear intention, and positive energy, we can transform this error, and return it to the service of **HaShem**. This is how the negative of a negative becomes a positive. It seems that the only way to extricate oneself from a bad situation is to embrace it so completely that you emerge from whatever it is. You accept (or submit) to the challenge, and instead of dispairing and feeding the dark, you embrace it, and thus transform it.

What often happens though is we forget our original goal. That is why we need to access the timeless and non-spacial place in us. For the only way something can remain in time, is if it has a timeless element in it. Remember our original goal, our primordial purpose is to serve the Creator – the Source of Creation – which is the most difficult task we face.

And now, another dynamic has entered – to experience the Divine with the Divine. In fact, when we have an experience of the Divine, being a part of the infinite source, we experience our selves in harmony  with the Divine. The reverberations of this moment of Grace last forever.

This comes from the fact that one can, for instance, only speak to the heart with one's own  heart. So, in order to be able to connect with the Divine, there has to be some part of you that is Divine too.

It is the Will of the Creator that is the very process of creation, whereby 1, something, emerges from 0, nothing. This happens an infinite amount of times &mdash; all at once &mdash; though in the realm of spacetime density, it might have taken billions of years.

It is the Creator who manifest the creates the infinite from the 0. It is we who try to measure the immeasurable, and always begin our count at 1, the bifurcate from the 1 into 2, and from 2 into the many. Thus we emerge from the Infinite Oneness into the One Infinite, through which we have can first conscious experience of the Infinite Being — the Oneness from which all is born.

Think of multiplication, '*', as the "influence" that is exerted,  a form of bonding. '1' exerts no influence on any other number, even though it exists in every number. In other words 'a' is the same as '1a'.  . Whereas the influence of -1 produces the negative, brings out the shadow — the hidden side, the below the line aspect, and turn 'a' into '-a'.

I propose that '_' is like force, and '+' is like form. '+' tends to be sequential, more cumulative, whereas '_' is more transformative. It can affect the very nature of the object of its attention.

[When in shadow, the light does not help. In fact, it actually disturbs the shadow seeker. By adding a piece that is equal in mass &ndash; but opposite &ndash; to the darkness, brings one to the space for change: -1 + +1 = 0.]{.note}

If '+' represents the positive force, '-' represents the negative. '*' and '/' are two opposite actions. The former represents expansion, enlargement. It is one of assembly, the multiplication, whereas the latter is the splintering, the separation, the reduction and the division.

Another way, to look at it is that whereas '+' is cumulative, and speaks of good deeds, '*' is transformative. It seems strange to come to the conclusion that (negative times negative) $$ '– \* – = +'$$. It states that the negative influence on another negative, transforms it into a '+', and this is not true – or is it?

| Add/Sub |  Multiplication|
|--- |--- |
|Positive  +1||
|0 + 0 = 0 | 0 \* 0 = 0|
|0 + 1 = 1 | 0 \* 1 = 0|
|1 + 1 = 2 | 1 \* 1 = 1|
|Negative  -1||
|0 - 0 = 0 | 0 \* 0 = 0|
|0 - 1 = -1 | 0 \* -1 = 0|
|1 - 1 = 0 | 1 \* -1 = -1|
|-1 - 1 = -2 | -1 \* -1 = 1|

On one hand we can take the slow road, the one of addition. Change the structure, as in -1 + 1 = 0. We will have arrived at the empty point, the point of transformation. Although pregnant with potential, though, nothing has yet transpired. We have just forgiven. We have made amends.

  The Same (Math)&nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>
</summary>

I need to point out here, that we often write -1 = -1, assuming, under the guise of mathematics, that they are identical in every way. This is a constriction that is necessary to be able to move about with relative ease in the realms of arithmetic and its related disciplines, without getting lost.

If I write -1 * -1 = 1, are all the '1's the same? That is an idealisation that I made, for 1 is not the actual object, but only indicative of an object. Because the truth of the matter is that 1 of anything is never really the same as another 1, even if they are of that same thing. For the actual things are referred to by the 1 are never the exact same. In the real world, although 1 orange plus another 1 orange will give us 2 oranges, each of those individual oranges are not equal, except in approximation – they are both "oranges". Because we are unable to &mdash; or do not wish to &mdash; see or understand the difference between them, we assume that there is none. On the metaphysical level, each one of those '1's are different, for they are standing in relation to one another. For instance, -1 = -1 is a redundant statement, perhaps similar to "I am because I am".

That it is not willing to look at the meta-difference, the spatial and time difference between them, is a constraint of mathematics. Perhaps each photon that is produced, is 1 photon. But then, once they enter into existence, each one is different, individual.

The use of mathematics abstracts out all the characteristics that individuate that particular item. Thus it is extremely useful for investigations that distance the investigator from the investigated. For instance, it is perfect for economic transactions, which have already succeeded in transforming real, individual items into numbers, which only speak of a sequence, or a key to other information.

If we went off the line by -1, we adjust by +1 to get back to the line. But only after we reach the line will we know that we are there, and would have to stop moving at this point. But there is an ongoing thrust (or else there is no line) and this thrust will cause us to overshoot the line, requiring say a -1 to return to the line again. So it will go, up and down, as represented by the sine wave. Thus this, so-called straight, line is an idealisation of nature and the natural unfolding of events.

Diagram (p18)

Now, this is a different algebra, where -1 + -1 = 0 (and +1 + +1 = 0). In the conventional sense, -1 + 1 = 0. Thus we have to answer a negative deed with a positive response, to bring it into balance again (0 point). If we want it to express itself in the positive space, we need to add another piece, just as large, +1. So, -1 + +1 = 1. That is why Jesus says, respond to the evil deed with love that is 70 times 70 greater than the deed.

Because, if we stopped at 0, we would not be in the correct trajectory. So, we need to adjust by more than that, and we compensate by 1, knowing we will have to make another adjustment. This is what causes the "wobble", the frequency adjustment, the "sine wave" ie the music of life. It is impossible to maintain the straight line. That is an idealization.

Remember '*' works on another plane. It is one of union. What emerges from the union is the same no matter which one went first, whether negative or positive.

It also states that if you unify with the dark forces, you will split and be trapped in a negative space. That is the negativity prevails. Interestingly enough, two negatives upon union, become a positive. So, completely good, or completely evil, the end is positive. So it is the imbalance that remains in the combination.

Also, from this interaction, '*', we produce the square root. From this we produce the complex, imaginary numbers (level 3?). This is in itself, an interesting investigation. One which we will put off for now.

Another interesting way to look at this, is that '-' produces a downward (negative) parabola, whereas '+' produces a positive one.

I take three deep breaths and wait for my spirit body to emerge. It comes out, still not fully alive, fully detached. Immediately, I hear this voice, loud and in my ear, narrating what is happening.

At first I respond, "O.K. Chill out."

I know this is my mind, the journaler, the narrator, telling the story.

"No," I insist, "I do not want to hear you narrating the story. I want to be."

It recedes for a short while and then pops up again, just as loud and persistent. I have made it to the tree by that time. But the voice kind of jerks me back.

Now, what does the narrator sound like, you may ask? That voice (Castaneda calls it the Inner Dialogue, or Voice Dialogue – a technique used in some therapy and self-help groups) just won't stop telling me everything that is happening. Like "I walked to the tree" when I have just walked to the tree.

Yes, I know what you are thinking. Who is the "I" that walked to the tree and who is the "I" that is saying, "I walked to the tree?" Correct?

There are two explanations and a merging in the end.

1. There are three "I's" in this story. Let's call them 'I', 'II' and 'III', just for fun. 'I' is the narrator, telling the story. 'II' is the I that walks over to the tree. 'III' is the 'I' that is listening to the narrator and sees 'II' walk over to the tree. The body is not an 'I', for it is, at this point, passive.
2. There are two "I's", 'I' and 'II' and they are reflections of one another, or, better yet, two manifestations of the same 'I'. 'II' hears 'I'. 'I' see 'II' walk to the tree. Then 'III' becomes the energy, the consciousness that flits from one to the other.

I suddenly thought of the pulsing that pervades the universe, the on/off, here one moment/gone the next. Like in quantum effects, wave/particle, life/death, etc. The _Sephirot_ of _Hod_, Reverberation, and _Netzach_, Continuation.

In between there is perhaps an infinitesimally small moment of transition, as the "attention" flits from one to the other, a fleeting, almost virtual moment where there is – Nothing? No 'I' or 'II', no 'I' or 'II' or 'III', no 'I' or 'II' or 'III' or 'IV' or 'V' or however many personas I have created.

In the end there is only one authentic I, and that is paradoxically the only one that doesn't exist! For only if I am being created every moment anew, every moment manifesting anew from the previous, can it be from the Creator. Else it is from the me that I have formed in the world, the finite, limited representation of the Infinite, Endless Divine energy of which I am a part.

The first, the original set in set theory is defined as the null-set. The set that contains nothing! What a contradiction. And, believe me, it took many years to get there. But that is the first, the original set. It is also symbolized as {}, or simply ø (notice the similarity to 0 (zero)).

What do we see? It amazes me how often the symbology used to express stuff (in mathematics too), can be so descriptive of the nature of what is really being expressed here. Now the curly brackets are used to designate a set, as in {a} is the set containing the element, or member, 'a'.

Now, we start in nothingness and only have {}. How appropriate that this is the mathematical representation for the empty set.

{ø} => a trilogy, op1 op2 op3
=> nothingness, ø is contained, limited by {} – time, a beginning and an end.

The first set is defined as the set containing the empty set, either {ø}, and the second set is defined as:
{ {ø}, {{ø}} },
the set containing the empty set, and the set of the set containing the empty set.

Let's build that up …. first to human expression. Then if we have n elements, Sn = {1,2,….,n} or more accurately, Sn = { }
We know that if ø Є Sn, the empty set is an element of Sn, thus we contain ø in us, in other words, we contain a piece of infinity in all of us. we all contain a piece of nothing – a paradoxical statement in its own right.

One of the ways to derive the material world is to define a relationship between two points. Then we have the line. The line of greatest tension, would be the straight line – of which there is only one (which doesn't really exist!). This line forms the (imaginary) basis around which all other lines between these two points dance, for between any two points there are an infinite amount of curved lines.

Let's not get too esoteric and talk about lines that are defined by the space between these two points. All the lines are non-looping, and continuous. Starting from just off the straight line, through the sphere, to a shape bulging hugely (almost infinitely, but not quite) in the middle. Let's not deal with all the possible shapes that could be formed by a line, non-looping, but otherwise any, between these two points. In fact, that is the way the creation manifests, by defining a relationship between all points.

All shapes on a plane are drawn, expressed by a point moving across the plane, creating lines. This requires a history, (out of time, out of sync) a memory of where the point was, a history, a past, in time)  

It starts off with a connection between two points, any two points &mdash; then the dance begins. The perfectly straight line is theoretical, and we have the ability to perceive these points &mdash; the end points, the beginning and the end of the line &mdash; and create relationships in our consciousness. However, they are never straight lines! Though, in a sense, it is these straight lines that form the core of the universe. They are G-d's presence, representing the /line/space of balance.

### Point of consciousness

A goal creates an imaginary, virtual line between your present point, and the goal which is in your future. Once we begin to move towards the goal, a "real" line is created, one of history and time.

> All movement requires a point of origin, a starting point.

Perhaps that's all we are: a "point" of consciousness moving across a what seems like a plane, but, being a hyperdimensional point, is actually a hyper-dimensional sphere, creating wonderful harmonies. As we think in essentially 2d concepts, a this and a that, the plane of our existence is defined by our beliefs/vision.

## IV Principle of balance

If I propose something, say P, immediately, we can imagine its opposite, ~P, or not-P.

P&nbsp;= the sky is blue -> the sky is not blue = ~P
&nbsp;&nbsp; = Life is hard -> Life is easy
&nbsp;&nbsp; = I love you -> I hate you.

By the Principle of Balance, the complimentary opposite is created. Therefore by creating X $$\leftrightarrow$$ ~X, its opposite, its reflection, occurs. I suppose a simplification of this Principle on a local level is that "energy is neither created nor destroyed". Maintain the original state of balance, whenever anything is created, its opposite manifests with it.

Think of it in terms of the Biblical creation story. Adam is created "both male and female", and then later is split into actual male and female.{.note}

Upon X coming into creation, ~X emerges as well at the same instant. Which is actually the real meaning of '=', equals. "X op Y", is an expression of X and Y's relationship. "XopY" expresses a relationship, 'op',  between any two positions or elements X and Y.

### Equals

Equal expresses a complete identification with, absolute equality. This is an idealization. In our real world, the world of action, _Assiyah_, nothing can truly be equal to anything else. For were it equal, identical, in _Malchut_, reality, it would be the same thing and there would be no distinction. Only in _Atzilut_, the highest realm, of emanation, we encounter the contradiction of everything being the same, yet different.

In fact, it can only be equal if it actually IS the other thing, yet it is obviously a different aspect of that actual thing. When I say _f(x) = y_, I am equating two different scenarios. This is an example of the "other" that is created.

#### Infinity Exercise 1

Holding nothing, begin to move on the line you have drawn in your imagination.
Continue out as far as you can.
In the midst of the infinite inequality around you,
seek the ultimate equality,
the one identification
that matches you completely.

The Other that we seek continuously.
That which is equal to me.
My soul mate,
the search the ultimate union with your Beloved _B'shirt_.
That is why we seek G-d.

An existential choice then appears.
Enter into union with your soul-mate,
or enter into strife,
seeking to separate back into your own self.

Continue on..
Go, go, go
Where are you now?

Can you go further?

What is beyond?
Anything?
What does it feel like?

Does infinity has a feeling?
Is this feeling in your body?
Or in your mind?
Does it have a colour?
A shape?
Where does it sit in the body?
What is it?

Somewhere, somehow I contain infinity in my being,
But it is there/here/everywhere!
Or is it that I am contained by the Infinite?

### Numbers

In order to measure, we start recording from the first data point, which we call the first, _breishit_, "in the beginning". Any event can only begin with the existence of something – at minimum one, or the first.

The paradoxical nature of this statement is that actually, in order for the narrative to begin, we need two – the binary, the duality, this and that. One is insufficient as there is nothing to know of the existence of the singularity if that is all that there is. It is then not, nor ever can be, an anomaly. Thus in order for anything to "exist", there needs to be two – itself and the other, the observer and the observed. We need the "other" that can relate or receive the narrative, the one we call the "witness".

The Wisdom of the Ages is that everything arose from this One, and everything is reducible to the One, which is, was and always will be the Source of Everything. Thus we have One that we refer to as God.

It was our brothers from the Ancient East who alerted us to the existence of a state before the One. A state from which the 'I' had emerged. They called it naught, Ø, the empty set – the reality of the existence of the One.

#### Exercise 2 - Numbers

Begin with numbers.  That is easy.
Count a bit, 1, 2, 3…
Continue counting...
Where are we going with this?
Starting anywhere, I can always get to infinity.

So let us continue...

Can run up the numbers this way.
Ask which numbers have a charge and why?

#### Zero

</summary>
<p>
Now, with division under our belt, we can state:
1/n -> inf. as n -> 0 and 1/n -> 0 as n -> inf.

$$\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} 1/n \to 0$$ (Eq. 1)

$$\displaystyle\lim_{n \to \infty} 1/n \to 0$$ (Eq. 2)

This is an expression of the journey of life.

Firstly, let me explain what they mean.

</p>
</details>

Firstly, envisage your point of origin (0), your zero point. Which is one  away from zero. The point of origin is the beginning point. The point that exists before any point (any 1) exists.

We start at 0 which is the point of origin, and expresses "Nothingness". It is from that space that we emerge. In other words, we project our consciousness ahead, make a goal, that we can signify as 1 &mdash; which signifies unification with the goal. Assume that the movement towards the goal is $$v$$. However, notice that the movement is away from $$ 0 $$. Thus the farther away from Nothingness that we move, the more self-identified we become. In other words, the more "manifest" we become. The 1 becomes clear, when it reflects itself.

To emerge from the nothingness, takes an infinite amount of energy. For we know that $$ 1/n \rightarrow 0, \mathrm{as}&nbsp; n \rightarrow \infty $$. However, going in the opposite direction, $$ 1/n \rightarrow \infty, \mathrm{as}&nbsp; n \rightarrow 0 $$, we need infinity to emerge from 0. That is why an infinite amount of energy is needed to produce the smallest bit of manifest material.

As we get closer and closer to $$\infty$$, we encounter the the miracle, the mystery, the involvement of the infinite to get from $$ 1 \rightarrow 1/n \rightarrow 0 $$. This is an interesting concept in its own right. Just as interesting as the mystery of going from $$ 1 \to 1/n \to \infty $$

The goal, 1, is on top, and the movement away from infinity is at the bottom, $$n \to 0$$. Going from $$ n \to \infty $$, we approach our unified selves. The upper portion of our being needs to hold the goal, and not waver, while the lower part of us, needs to tends to or away from $$ \infty $$ for us to fully manifest ourselves.

I love this piece. It shows exactly what it takes. If I, (1), tends towards $$ \infty $$, I become 0. If I tend towards nothingness, 0, I become $$ \infty $$, fullness &mdash; but in that dynamic, I also lose myself.

As we emerge from the primordial soup, of 0, we see only our reflections. That is how 1 and -1 emerge. We look back, and because we cannot see anything (0), instead we see ourselves reflected in the universal mirror of nothingness. Remember it is a compassionate universe, so it gives us what we want, what we can see. So, we are 1, and looking back towards 0, we see -1, unless we are aware of G0D. It seems like it is another part of us, or G-d, but in fact it is the exact mirror.

#### One

1 – מלכות, _Malchut_, reality. The 3d world in which we live.
Meditate on the first number.
We know 1 is special.

One occurs once, and expresses the identity. For every number from that one concept is made of a collection of identities. Every other number becomes something else. When 1 passes through it does not affect its target. It leaves little trace behind. Only one and two remain the same whether merging or adding. Yet only one retains its identity in the merging (\*) operation.

It is the Id in its fullness so when it interacts, as in 1 * 3, it does not transform nor does it affect the object. However, it is an addition to the situation, as in 3 + 1 = 4. In fact, it is what enables growth, movement to the new phase the new level.

Now we have the opposite of multiplication as well, which is know as division that expresses the splintering (whereas '-' expresses the annihilation. But this is actual splintering, and produces the real world, _Malkhut_.

This is how 1 also contains infinity, and thus every other number too.

#### Two

2 – is from the Id.
If 1 = 1, 1 = 1 is the splitting, the identification, the recognition. I am now no longer alone. Eve has emerged from Adam Kadmon, the first man.

Eve emerges from Adam's penchant for separation. This is an expression of the man's living in duality and opposites. Now Eve, having emerged from Adam seeks union, back to the source. She is not seeking to remove herself even more.{.note}

e still have to talk about the 2 which signifies the duality, the one and the other, this and that, the binary world we encounter.

I propose this defined the order. It is the structure upon which creation turns. It defines the core energy of Creation, for it is the always balanced expression of the manifest world. It is the bridge. That is why all relationships show you your shadow.

More broadly, it is ~a that defines who 'a' is. Who u are defines u just as much as who u are not defines u.

From this we derive the law of opposites. This is the order, first the one, the One God. We splinter to become two, birthed from our one. That is what our worldview is based &mdash;  a binary world, a world of opposites, of judgment. The world of singularity would be heaven. The place of knowingness, of union of 'a' & ~a, the one-ness.

That is where the axiom of choice comes in. You need to chose which direction to go to find the one – through seeking 1 or seeking -1. This is basically the theme of ACIM, _A Course In Miracles_, which proposes that there are two basic impulses in our lives, that of love or that of fear.

When in the world of one you are spiritually aware, having realised it is all one, all the same, coming from a single source, and you long for the zero point, the annihilation, the emptiness of the infinite, if masculine. The feminine, however, seek the fullness of the infinite, that is why it is the expression of form, where the masculine is the expression of the emptiness.

Now 2 is in constant flux, and it creates the first wheel from the dynamic between $$ 1_i &nbsp;\mathrm{and}&nbsp; 1_k  $$.
</p><p>
Its order is created like this:
</p><p>
(Picture (P1) of circle with lines)
</p><p>
In order for 2 to exist,
if a + b = 2, then a  b.
In other words, even though, mathematically a = b = 1 (we are still in the integer realm), philosophically, a is NOT b, thus {a} & {b} are not equal albeit possibly equivalent, for they differ in at least one aspect, one element – even if it is only spacial. In other words, a  b & b  ~a. Also b  -a. Though b is connected to a, for b = some part of ~a  a. This has to be true, as a  ~a defines the universe.
</p><p>
Let's look at this more accurately, using the rationals.
</p><p>
If a + b = 2, then there is only one solution where a = b = 1, for which this equation holds. But there are an infinite amount of solutions where a  b. This holds when you are not perfectly balanced, and do not have a clear picture of yourself, in that a <> b, if 'a' understands itself clearly, then it would reflect itself the other perfectly, and a $$\equiv$$ b.
</p><p>
Now, let's look into the more complex world of יצירה! The next ספירה (sphere of existence) up.
</p><p>
In other words, by its very nature, b defines an interaction between 'a' & the place her shadow -a exists. Thus -a must then be an element of ~a.

Masc -> separation, Fem -> Union. This is the movement of the 1 -> 2, and the 2 -> 1, forming the circle. As the masculine extends himself from 1 → 2 → 3 …, so the feminine seeks to return to the union, the 3 → 2 → 1. Thus we call the feminine negative, for it is through division (or subtraction) we reduce our number back to the 1. As we know, all division will end at 1. m/n → 1 as n → m. Once we have the emergence of 2, the addition of 1 + 1, we have knowledge of Good and Evil, of the opposites, the annihilation and creation, life and death, for 1 – 1 = 0, an eye for a eye, a life for a life. But also 1 + 1 = 2..., which is the ultimate union in **Malchut**.

We continue further into the axiom of aloneness, of perfection, where 1 \* 1 = 1 which represents balance, yet is static, a continuation of the same. It is also a form of narcissism, whereby $$1^2 = 1$$, that all that is being produced is another version of the same thing.
</p>
</details>

By גבורה, _Gevurah_ is the holy splintering. It is our shadow manifest on the canvas of Creation. It is, in it's weird way, also our connection to the Greater Manifestation. This is why we need to do our shadow work, why the dark night of the soul, the hero's journey, our trail through darkness, leads us to an encounter with the Divine. By growing from the challenges of our shadow, we can reach a stare of grace.

##### The square

The square, with its 2 elements doubled, is the first emergence into stable form. It occurs in the doubling of the duality.  This is the place of intersection. The doubling of the doubles, embedding themselves in this world &mdash the essential bifurcation.

Note: 2 is the only double whose 2 + 2 = 2 \* 2.

<p>
Playing with the square, we get $$ a \* a = a^2 $$, as a form of narcissism, a doubling of your persona. In this case, the result is positive, and the person could be a great leader. However, $$ a \* -a = a^2 $$ as well, then there is evil afoot.
</p>
</details>

#### Three

Three is the formed world, the trinity, the trigram. It emerges from love. Do something for love and something else will grow out of it, the product of the love. It is a vessel with the light (love) pouring in, being filled.

The breath moves from the contraction, _Tzimtzum_, to the exhalation, where the pain of constriction is realised, pouring out is love. Three is the result of coordinated movement (union) between the two.

##### 3 dimensional

We start with three physical dimensions and time. We meditate on the here and now, as timeless. Being totally in the present, we are fully in the trinity of the present three-dimensional reality.

Three dimensions are expressed in the fuzziness between the right and the wrong, their harmonics we might call it. It is the curved lines between any two points, that needs to be reduced to a straight line in order for us to do anything with it. So, we enter the world of sacred three-dimensional geometry. This collapses into a two-dimensional reality, one that our minds can cope with, that of right and wrong.

Now we are in the manifest universe, with duality, with opposites. With the wheel (sphere) of existence.

Now if two $$a$$'s are identical, in other words, $$ a_j = a_k $$. If they are equal, and there is no movement. This is the Level I, the _doppelg&auml;nger_.

#### Number 4

Four is the completion of the first cycle. That is why it signifies death in the Chinese numerology. It also signifies stability. The circle is complete. How does five emerge from here?

It is also $$ 2^2 $$.

#### Number 5

Five is a difficult number. It is unstable. It is the beginning of another cycle of life. It is expaning into the world.

> 5 is _Tiferet_.

The Einsteinan revolution is the belief in a two-way relationship. That the energy flows both ways. What I do matters. It matters to G-d who wishes to have a loving relationship with us.

---

## Electron

The chances of this happening are  infinitesimal. Only through Divine Guidance does it happen. Having absorbed the energy (light), there is less love and light in the immediate vicinity. So it produces darkness. Now $$e^-$$ is in love, charged in the state of union with its beloved. But the breath of creation, also known as Father Time, breathes again &mdash; for it cannot remain in stasis. It has to spread the love. It has become too full and so it needs to empty itself, as there is no waste in the universe, and there is no place for narcissism in the functioning world. That is why it is good.  It has become too full and by the law of balance, returns the light to Almighty and thus becomes an expression of the of the צימצום, _Tzimtzum_. The Bridge to love!

---

## Spiral

The circle is actually not complete, in fact it is more like a spiral. This would be a circle in time. Although we envision a straight line, actual movement always takes place as a spiral, which on the plane looks something like

Diagram (Spiral) (see p36)

which, in fact, looks a wave!

#### Quantum

From this line of reasoning, quantum physics predicts that all of space must be filled with a universal sea of [Zero-point energy](http://www.calphysics.org/zpe.html). Since space itself is thought to break up into a kind of quantum foam at a tiny distance called the [Planck scale](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-the-planck-scale-and-why-do-physicists-use_b_59ee45cee4b031d8582f5767), the  length of which is $$ 1.616 x 10^{-35} &nbsp; \mathrm{meters} $$, it is argued that the zero point fluctuations must cease at a corresponding [Planck frequency](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Planck_frequency) ($$ 2.952 x 10^{42} $$). If that is the case, the zero-point energy density would be 110 orders of magnitude greater than the radiant energy at the center of the Sun.

This is the way out of the principle of the Multiverse. In the place of the _tsimtsum_, we now have the world emerging out of the quantum foam. Around this "sphere" of foam, we have G\*d. That is, the rest of the "space" is filled with the infinite potentiality of G\*d &mdash; represented by all these experiences, that are the lines of exploration of every possibility. Remember, if we change one small variable, it will change everything. There are equivalences, the _doppelg&auml;nger_ level I multiverse. There every single possibility in this realm, although huge but not infinite, are carried out.

This is just an example of the infinite attribute of _Ha'Shem_. For imagine you were the infinite mind, would that not be the way You would look at everything? In that instant you would be able to see all the possibilities inherent in each moment. The exercise is in seeing which ones will work and which ones will not. Or perhaps, You already know?

Like a mathematical genius, working out which functions approach a limit, and which ones do not, I believe there is only one correct answer, and that is the point. There is only one correct answer to where the potential will properly manifest. There is only one line. But, having removed Himself, the possibility of choosing other lines, despite all the evidence to the contrary, must be a constant source of amusement and enjoyment. How can we get out of that one? Would You not project the correct line, just to see what would happen. That is also the line around which we dance. It is the way you can just change, just heal. That is the manifestation of the healing force in nature. It is consistent with the view that it is always present. For, the "correct" line is also always running, and with the correct adjustment you can merge with it again.

Now the other realms are expressions of the other worlds, the other levels, in each of one of which you have the infinite representations as well. But there is only one line from a point in the most complex level 4 world to a point at the basic dualistic realm down here.

## Human

We are 4d (consciousness) having a 3d (real/mundane) experience &mdash; or experiencing/living in a 3d reality. Thus there is something always missing, something that we are always seeking, and the only way we can find it is by accepting the higher 4d consciousness that we are capable of accessing.

However, even though we are in a 3d world, it seems most of us are born with 2d awareness &mdash; those that live in a world of right and wrong, good and evil. Animals are a good example, also amoral people.  If you, being aware of the 3rd dimension, have to calculate for 3 dimensions, while another is only working in 2 dimensions, the latter will be able to arrive at a decision sooner. It can even implement it more swiftly, while you are hamstrung by the extra dimension you are taking into account. One could say that the 2d being has immediate advantage, but, because it has only taken in 2d effects, although your action might take longer to prepare, it is likely to be more effective in the long run.

It is the different between the one who says, "This is in my way. If I push it aside, I can continue", versus the other that considers the effect upon the one being pushed aside, and feels some empathy for them.

### Interactions

The 3d consciousness is aware of objects entering from 4d in the similar fashion to that of a 3d object appearing and moving through 2d behaves. Assume the object is a 3d sphere. To a 2d being it will look like a circle that starts from a dot, whose horizon expands into a circle till it reaches the same size as the sphere, the zenith, at which point it will start to shrink, until there is nothing.

<figure style="float:right">
  <img src='/posts/img/qkab/journey_to_infinity_p40_300x137.jpg' alt='2d seeing 3d event' width='300' height='137' />
  <figcaption>3d event passing through the 2d plane</figcaption>
</figure>

That is fairly easy to comprehend as a 3d being looking at a 2d event. But, what if I was the 2d being looking at this event of the shrinking and expanding circle – rather like an eclipse.  For the 2d being, it will look something like a shockwave approaching it, which suddenly begins to recede (for no apparent reason).

A necessary first element that is required for the 2d being is time. Which is a 4<sup>th</sup> dimensional element. Depth and relationship being the 3<sup>rd</sup> dimensional element arising out of 2-dimensional interactions. Something we can even refer to as "consciousness", that is, consciousness of an event occurring. The second element is the ability to remember the occurrence of that event. That is memory, another interesting element of our consciousness.[^5], that creates your "narrative".

For a 2-dimensional being having a 3-dimensional experience, at time zero, it sees nothing. At time 1, it sees a mysterious dot appearing in its world. As it is watching, and time passes, it sees the dot grow into a hemisphere, growing steadily, until it reaches its zenith, whereupon it will begin to shrink until it becomes a dot again, and disappears. Now, this phenomenon could occur, with no being in 2d is recording it, and it will go unnoticed. But in order for it to "awaken" the 2d being(s), it will need to be "noticed", recorded, and explored.

If it happens only once, it is unique, and perhaps aberrant. If it occurs periodically (like the sun rising over the horizon), then measurements can be collected and some theories as to what mystery is occurring here can begin to be formed. Perhaps the genius will arise who can put all the hypothesis and conjectures together with the measurements and come up with the conclusion that it is a 3d circle, or a sphere. Prior to this genius, there must have been one or another who proposed the existence of another dimension &mdash; the 3<sup>rd</sup> dimension. That was the truly evolutionary step in their "science", for our investigator would have to have some concept of 3d in order to even propose it might be a sphere. So, although living in 2d, he would now have the awareness of an actual event in 3d.

In our present 3d world, we are encountering the same phenomenon. Using a similar metaphor as the one previously. Perhaps a photon is some 4d object touching our realm. Perhaps we, even, are higher dimensional beings that are "passing through" this 3d realm.

### Point of Information

Everything responds at the point. All emerges from the point. All occurs at the point. The only reality we have is the point of the present, the here and now of the (present) moment.

But the kicker is, that although we can imagine, or speak of a point, there is actually no such thing, just as there is no perfect circle, anywhere in reality. Thus, what we call points, are actually regions in space that behave like points. It has virus like behaviour, in that once enough "density" in a certain region then it changes, an identifiable object, a "real" point, might emerge.

Every point contains information., what we call "packets" of information In fact, the point IS the information. That is what makes it possible to "see" it, as it embodies the moment and the moment embodies it – the eternal conjugation of _Abba_, the supernal father, and _Ima_, the supernal mother – like two billiard balls colliding, there is the moment/point of contact

These points make up the lines, circles, spirals of your life, some of which you are aware of, and many of which you are not.

In 2D if that is all you are capable of
In 3D if you can attain depth
In 4D if you attain sight
In 5D if G!d chooses you!{.poem .note}

My point here is to bring attention to the idea that all interaction happen at the point, a moment – what is referred to the tangent, which can be used to identify and extract information regarding that point.

<details>
<summary class="button  is-outlined is-small is-rounded is-warning">Tangent:&nbsp;<i class='fa fa-solid fa-caret-down'></i>
</summary>
<p>
A tangent is a line that touches a circle at one point only. This is the breath of the Lord passing over, touching one point and transforming it. If the line is not tangenital, and crosses the circle at two points, it means that you are not properly aligned, and this will produce two points, that are often in conflict with one another, being somewhat "opposites".
</p><p>
Whatever the frequency of the breathing cycle, only a single point experiences the breath of G-d at any single cycle. That is the maintaining of creation. Perhaps in a moment every point is touched.  That is how U and I are created. By a sequence of points being touched in the same way, imprinted with the same pattern.
</p>
</details>

### Information/Event
  
An event consists of the information (form) and the distribution (energy) of this information. It can often be seen as an action, a change, and of course, each event will produce a change in the system, even if only felt locally...

This event mapping forms the topology of your persona. Tracking the data (i.e. information) flow can produce a very complete profile one's persona, sufficient to enable predictability and thus manipulation.

<p>Would it not be possible to make certain predictions of behaviour if one tracked people's narratives that way? Would one not begin to have certain mappings, certain responses that one would be able to identify?

<p>
This is a whole new area of activity to investigate. A predictive algorithm based on behaviour patterns from the past. But over time, would it not be possible to see the same patterns emerging. I am not sure of the variance here, but I don't think it will be large.</p>
<p>That previous paragraph was written in the late 90's. Time has shown that to be correct, with Cambridge Analytics, Google, Facebook, etc and their gathering of data on people, and then using AI for predicting behaviour.

</details>

### Primal Point

Everything points to this primal point, the point that is not a point. In fact, the only point that is not a point, and precedes the manifestation. For there must be a something that manifested, or caused the manifestation, and that is referred to as Nothing, or, more accurately "No-thing"

When 0 is added to or removed from something, it does not affect it at all – as in 5 +/- 0 = 5. In other words, everything is perfect in its own right, and nothing can be added or subtracted from it. Whereas when it merges with anything, the thing merges with nothing, 0, like disappearing into a black hole, represented in our language by '*', or multiplication – as in 5 \* 0 = 0. And obviously everything contains an infinite amount of nothing! 5/0 = ∞ (or "undefined"). These, 0 and ∞, represent the boundaries or limits of our minds/consciousness! The beginning and end, the alpha and omega.

As it says, "Out of the simple nothing arose a point", which is represented by 1, the 1<sup>st</sup>. The first point, the beginning, the start of the manifestation.

One also represents a period. In that guise, it expresses an ending as well, as well as a basic measurement. For one second, means that one unit of whatever has transpired. That unit then becomes the basis on which the rest of that type of measurement is based. Once we have agreed on the measurement/status of the One, we can then continue on to build the rest of the system.

0 -> 1 – the seed
1 -> 2 – the start of the dynamic
2 -> 3 – reproduction, continuation...

Here the concept of **recursion** is manifested, in that from the period, or step, the energy or dynamic/will that reproduces, is just another step in the journey... then we know there is life, a continuation and, as is sometimes said, "The narrative begins...".

Here it is fully manifest, not emerging, but recursing, and clearly represents a beginning and an end. Where the one is the end of the emergence, the two represents the first step on the journey of manifest existence. Like the seed of a fruit that produces a tree that produces a fruit...

### Numbers as Points
  
Numbers are accounts of points (objects), and of events. They mark points. They also mark the beginning and the end points (of an event, etc.).
  
### Points as products

Therefore the point is the product, which produces a number in an account, the "economic" point, and it is this point which determines the fate of the business. The information contained in that number affects the business and its prospects.

### Influence of 4d

Already U manifest in 3d due to the immanence of G!d. Rather it is to be "informed" by 4d information/perspective. Just as 3d adds depth and thus perspective &mdash; which is information &mdash; to an image, so 4d adds a 4d perspective to the 3d image. Already we are aware of many of the effects of this 4d information on 3d. Like quantum effects, electricity/magnetism, etc. It has a distinctly non-physical 3d presence, recently uncovered and described by mathematics, which also has a distinctly non-physical 3d presence – yet, also, has had a huge impact on our 3d world.

We cannot sense it, with any of our physical senses, but we know it is there. Do we contain another sense, one that is not part of the five known ones? Is it even a sense? Perhaps "extra-sensory perception" is a much more descriptive name for it. Everyone can "see/feel" a parabola in the curve of a ball thrown, for &mdash; without knowing any of the mathematics involved, you are still capable (perhaps intuitively) of "working out the equations" and  catching the ball thrown to you. How? Taking all the calculations entailed in that catch, calculating trajectory and speed swiftly enough to position yourself in the correct place to catch the thrown ball &mdash; how do we actually manage to do that? Some part of us is an incredible mathematician... we just can't express it in the language of mathematics – though we might have more human ways of expressing it.

One might even describe mathematics as a 4d language. For we cannot use it in any social or interactive context. None of our human languages can be described mathematically – nor can we speak "mathematics". It can only be used to describe elements – and in its lower form (accounting/arithmetic/geometry) it controls this world, but recently it has been describing a fascinating "new" world – which consists of the world of quantum and cosmology, worlds that seem to be intimately connected to this one. In fact, it was by trying to understand and penetrate the mystery of this world in which we live, that we entered into this realm.

Perhaps the shamans and mystics of yore (and present) were also trying to explain this "other" world, and were using the symbols and languages available to them at the time. Some of the more ancient languages also seem to have elements that point to these influences – though that might be a reading and perspective we have developed recently.

## Particle of Consciousness
  
> It takes an infinite amount of energy to produce a single point.

What if consciousness could be thought of in a similar fashion to the quantum phenomenon – in that it could be described in terms of waves, with thoughts being "fundamental particles of consciousness", and the awareness of any event consisting of a collection of these fundamental particles to make up the collection of thoughts that make up any event we are conscious of? Just as we have the fundamental particles of quantum thermodynamics that make up the atoms with which our world is comprised. Interestingly enough, these sub-atomic particles seem to exist close to the realm of consciousness – that of unseen events.

I would even go so far as to propose that a thought is a fundamental particle too. These particles form a "thought wave" which collapses also in some magical way. One could say that by completing a thought, the thought waves have now collapsed into a thought...

If enough of these waves positively interact, a "thought" emerges by the process of accumulation - like waves crossing on the ocean, just as a particle would form when there is enough density, that is, accumulation of energy, to be measured. But if the waves are negative, then there it will counter their  emergence &mdash; resulting in a decrease in consciousness. And, as nature abhors a void, this lack, or emptiness will be filled &mdash; by whatever manages to claim this open space in your consciousness.

This adheres to the Kabbalistic view of the _Tzimtzum_. This is the process whereby the Supernal Being &mdash; referred to as _Ein Sof_, or Infinity &mdash; literally "Boundless Being" &mdash; constrained Itself to produce space for Creation to emerge. It is described as a circle in which the ray of Supernal or Divine light enters to "give it life".

Here, I propose, that once having formed the space for Creation, the will to manifest, which is essentially that there will be no empty space in this, emerged. This is known as "Nature abhors a vacuum".

### Event Point

We become aware of an event after we become conscious of the occurrence, for there is a time lag between the event and our consciousness of its occurrence.

### Ocean of Consciousness

We exist in an ocean of consciousness. In fact, we are that consciousness too. Something which we feel, like the fish feels the currents and energies of the water. It almost talks to it, but in a different language. The way our most sophisticated minds have currently expressed these waves that we can somehow experience, but externally we can only measure with highly sophisticated electronic instruments, is as "waves of probability"... and that is an excellent post-modern way of stating it. These waves of probability are measurements of the possibility of an event occurring which we call proton, or boson, photon or quanta, but might have had other names at other times. In earlier times it was referred to more simply as water &mdash which is a good analogy for the effect of waves, and more recently, though there is some evidence of a similar idea in ancient Buddhist texts, it seems, as Aether. In some interpretations, water is seen as a dense version of light, as light is believed to be a dense version of a more subtle vibration, a "supernal" or divine light.

One could think of this ocean of consciousness as a store of potential energy, like a battery – that is why it is often referred to as the Source. This battery can be used to power many different items, from tools to lights. This battery stores  energy as potential energy, and releases it when connected correctly to another event. Thus it is with the ocean of consciousness, like a battery, but you have to have the correct wires, made from the right material, connected correctly to the battery to tap the potential hidden in the battery.

But not only that, the object that is being connected has to be able to handle the current that is now pulsing through it. As with all spiritual energy, it has to used, given, released, else it turns toxic and dangerous – as opposed to material, or mundane things, where the dynamic is to collect and hoard as much as possible. In order to do that, it needs to be correctly designed with the correct materials, and maintained a certain way to continue to be able to function correctly. The better attuned it is, the more efficient and effective it will be.

### 4d Minds

Could our brains be able to handle 4d minds?
Perhaps if there were not so many mundane distractions, and mental training and protocols of behaviour (especially when in or using 4d tools).

[^1]: +Scared -> sacred, just swapping the 'a' and the 'c'. Investigating the sounds of the words, it starts off with the 's', of the snake, of the spiral emergence. Then it opens to the vowel, the 'a', sound. 'A' the first letter of the alphabet, the aleph, the alpha of the omega, the primal cause. It is also a vowel, which gives shape to the word. It is also a folding of the 's', into the 'a', 's'->'a' and then closing into the 'c'. Scared however has the 'c' following immediately after the 's'. Thus it constrains upon emergence, not giving it time to capture or enclose the inner space. It is immediately in form and fear.
On the other hand, scared -> scarred, is when, whatever the fear is, it becomes embedded (doubled in its center, with the density represented by the 'r') in the core of the issue, and then remains, a wound, never forgotten, always a part of your being.
[^2]: +This refers to all the parts of my being and all the parts of the greater being, earth, and all the beingnesses in creation.
[^3]: +For there are two types of "facts". The first is a description of an actual event, the other arises just by its insistence, by its being constantly repeated until it is generally accepted as a "consensual" truth, a fact everyone agrees upon.
[^4]: +How interesting the similarity between 'I' and '1' in the English language – for in other languages, the word for 'I' is very different. In Hebrew, for instance, it is 'ani', consisting of three letters, and in Afrikaans, it is 'ek', and in French, 'je'. Another interesting fact here, is that in English we write the personal pronoun 'I' capitalised, whereas in most other languages we do not!

The compass we use to determine direction has true north as its anchor. In fact, all measuring devices require the same two elements in order to produce any valid results.

[^8]: That is the beauty of mathematics, and its pull for those who are able to hear it. It is like a chord that enables us to explore amazing realms of the imagination, even think thoughts that few are able to comprehend. It is the thread that leads us back to the point we started from.

[^9]: And here we encounter the paradox that in order for there to be an infinity, there must be finites. The only thing that is not infinite is the finite &mdash; which must separate itself from the infinite to be embodied. For instance, every number possible can exist, There is no number that you can say is not possible. I can add as many digits as I want, ten, a hundred or a bizillion. They all exist. There is no censorship allowed here. And what about numbers that don't really exist like pi, or phi, or the natural logarithm (and many more)? May I be so bold as to ask whether we are the same as numbers? To be trite, it is like the necessity to be named in order to be able to exist &mdash; just as for some mysterious reason, Adam had to name all the animals of the bible.
