<h3>Journey to Infinity</h3>

Cartwheels within cartwheels,
Seeking vortexes that will heal
While journeying between the two worlds,
this one and that.

Rich, inner lives that can
Nourish us, for creativity comes
From within, from a deep-dark
Place, a place of the night,
Where the primordial waters lap.

This is our inner wealth

Without which seekers become
Architects, building the constraints,
The _Gevurah_, **גבורה**, of space and time.

Afraid of the aloneness,
We fill the darkness
With our echoey cries.
Just our own voices, the inner dialogue,
Answering. We can only hear ourselves.

That is loneliness.

A single tiny light, hovering, a candle-flame,
In an infinity of darkness.

Only in a void can _Ein Soph_ **און סוף** write.
Only in a completely and
Absolutely empty space can Her
Voice be heard, singing, singing all of Creation
Into existence.

Otherwise it is jagged,
incoherent and discontinuous,
disturbed by whatever is
blocking it.

To be surrounded by God,
is to be surrounded by an infinity
of nothingness.
Yet
how is it that I can find You
in this endless nothingness?
How can You exist by my side,
be of me
yet separate from me?
How can I love some One else?
Is it not all reflections?
Just creations of my own,
reflected on the mirror
that surrounds me?

How dismal.
How awesome.

In the Divine Realm of Infinity,
time and space have no
Meaning,
so a movement
can be forever,
And an infinite distance
is the same as You
being
right beside me.

<h3>The Journey Begins</h3>

**Descend** with me into my dungeon.
It is a journey I want you to take with me.
In my dungeon is a scared[^1] me.
A me that has been whipped and scarred,
and is afraid.
Help free her,
lead her out of the darkness and into the light.
That she may take her place
besides the other angels,
and play happily with my other children.
All safe, all joyful – expressing themselves,
working for the greater gift of All.[^2]

**Breathe, breathe, breathe.**

Every breath changes everything.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is interconnected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move one iota and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The configuration of the whole

## Science

Science knows that it is time for the truth to emerge, for shift from its false paradigm to occur, the stepping out of the realm that only sees form, into the mysterious spaces of the realms that we so fear. It is inevitable &mdash; as surely as the sun rises and the seasons come. It is our deep denial. But the writing is on the wall &mdash; the evidence is incontrovertible.

Already compartmentalized by the rational constraints imposed by the requirement of scientific proof, a closed field. The concept that only by investigating, even acknowledging, a limited, essentially tiny amount of the totality, can we produce better results &mdash relying on the empirical “facts” collected.[^3]

Only in that closed, limited sense, are these facts “true”. They are not absolute truths; they are relative objects whose birth is related to the time, place and culture that they were born in.

### Atoms & Molecules

We are made of the same atoms and molecules as those in the air around us. This is what the priests of our society, the scientists, tell us. For they have become the keepers of the great myths of our time – the creation myth, the dying story, why events occur or don’t occur, disease, and pain, etc.

We are told that there are atoms and molecules in the air. We believe this, bolstered by the faith in rational and logical process, nourished by the need to have basic elements of existence that we can verify. We believe in our myths, just as the ancients believed in their stories of creation. These myths, born prior to our science, permeate and pollute our structures providing meaning to our lives and the things we do.

This mythology of our time tells us that these atoms are made up of particles. In the end the mystery of numbers, produced a mythical equation that tells us that matter and energy are the same thing. From this, we understand that there is no thing, for its mass, its density, its “factual” reality, particles, are just energy &mdash; and somehow light plays a part in this manifestation.

We are surrounded by our reflections &mdash; what we “see”, what we “hear”, what we “smell”, what we “taste”, what we “feel”, what we “think”, and even what we “desire”. All are vibrational in their essence.

> Breathe in, breathe out (x3)

Imagine all those atoms and molecules, those billions and billions of little ‘things’ entering your body. All bunched together as the dust, bacteria, dead skin, etc, surrounding us, floating in the “air”. All the incredible array of substances and clusters of things entering our bodies from our surroundings.

How are we separate from this primordial soup that encloses, even defines, us? In order to define who we are, from the physical to the spiritual, we are enclosed in the sound of Other. It is like the one melody, the one voice that rises above the choir. It is the one voice (perhaps the only voice) that you hear most clearly. Thus, one could say, that we are singing ourselves into existence, just as the God’s infinite voice brought creation into existence.

> Breathe in, slowly

The air and energy around you is affected by your removal of those elements of the air that you have breathed in. Changing and affecting everything around your self.

> Breathe out, slowly

Now you breathe out all this air you had in your body and lungs into the space surrounding you. Again, affecting it even if just by your placing a whole lungful of air into your immediate area.

> Breathe in, breathe out (x3)

However, in addition to that, while it was in your body. You have changed it, affected it, transformed in—placing your “stuff” in it, removed what you wanted from it, inserted thoughts about it. About exiting, it contains pieces of yourself, all that you had inside of you, breathed out.

The Other entering and leaving transformed by your very existence. The air around you dances with you all the time, in and out and around, every day of your life.

We are in constant dialogue with the universe around us.

## Axioms

### Axiom I: Axiom of Existence

The first premise is that there is something that exists &mdash; call it consciousness or self-awareness.

From that we derive that there has to be a differentiation of some sort, an otherness. For anything to exist, for anything to be recognizable, to have an identity, it needs to be, in some way, different from its surroundings. Which presupposes some sort of recognisable order. A this and a that.

### Axiom Ia: Awareness of Self

> There exists at least one element that is aware of its own existence, and is able to express/communicate this awareness.

A corollary to this first axiom is that there exists at least one element in this universe that is also aware of its existence &mdash; and, lo and behold, can express it. Probably all living things are aware of their existence, but few are able to make some representation of that awareness. We, as humans, have been gifted with the ability to communicate our inner thoughts to one another in a mostly meaningful manner.

The interesting paradox of this “self-awareness” is that there has to be an “other” that is aware of itself. Or something which is not that which it is aware of. There has to be a separation of some nature between the being and whatever in the being that is conscious of itself—conscious enough to be able to represent itself.

This is based on the fact that in order for something to exist, there has to be something else that is not that which exists. A separation. Simply, for a fish to exist in the ocean, it cannot be water. One could say that there needs to be three elements – the “thing” itself, the border or skin that defines/contains the thing, and the outside that is separate (probably by the skin itself) from the contained “thing”.

### Axiom Ib: Awareness of Other

Which brings us to the gift of speech, which the sages say differentiates us from the animals. I would express it in a more modern manner, by saying that the ability to communicate, to express myself in meaningful ways, is the differentiation.

In order to be able to communicate, or to propose the concept of communication, we need at least two elements for this to occur. In fact, we know that it requires far more than two of these elements for a communication system to become functional. Thus the conclusion is that there are a certain number of these self-aware elements—let’s say N elements, which is the minimum amount required in order for a method of communication to emerge.

I would propose that is different for verbal communication (ʋ) than for written (ѡ) communication. If that is true, then it would make sense that ѡ > Nʋ. Where ‘>’ or ‘greater than’, would mean requiring more complexity and thus, in most cases, a larger pool of elements. It is known that something like 90% of words in the English language are hardly ever used in the spoken language.

Consider then, that the complexity and pervasiveness of the communication systems we have at present requires a significant proportion of the current population to exist.

Just imagine if all sentient beings on this planet were communicating. What an incredible event.

## Axiom II: Axiom of Choice

From this point, the point of existence, I[^4] can suggest the existence of a non-empty set, a set that is different from the empty set, the set of nothingness. However, it is a set that is distinct from this element of existence.

Mathematicians would express this axiom as that there exists a set that has discrete elements in it, one of which, at least, can be chosen.

Thus we arrive at the Axiom of Choice, which says that we can basically choose any place as our point of origin. Any place, as our beginning. Which requires the Axiom of Existence, which proposes existence of a non-empty set.

Let us imagine a collection of baskets, each of which are non-empty. If a basket is empty, then there is not much we can do with it. What the axiom of choice then says is that we can choose a member from each set in that collection. This is a mathematical expression of free will. We have a choice, and through these choices we create our path. This path can be expressed in some form or fashion. It is what one may call one’s vector of existence.

---

Let’s extend this discussion.

Beginning with the fact that something exists, something that we can even call the null (or empty) set, the set that contains nothing. If there is such a non-element, then immediately, from the ‘that’, we deduce a ‘this’, from the &#x2205; we have a ‘not-&#x2205;’ or a non-empty set.

Suddenly where ‘&#x2205;’ was there is ‘$$A$$’, which represents a (non-null-)set, such that $$ x \in A $$.

This adds another characteristic to the set of elements that we have proposed, and that is one of **activity**, a dynamic, allowing for a recognizable change of state.

## Axiom III: Axiom of Relationship

Could we state our next axiom as the axiom of relationship? Although we have only referred to this state as one of dynamics, i.e., as a change of state, I refer to it as the Axiom of Relationship, and not that of dynamic, because in order to recognize a change of state, for the dynamic present to have any meaning to the $$I$$, that we have proposed, I have to have some sort of relationship with this dynamic, otherwise I will not be able to identify any change in the state.

By the removal of $$I$$ then, a space, a vacuum, nothingness has entered.

If there is an element that is able to occupy $$A$$’s vacated space, not-$$A$$, or ~$$I$$’, that presupposes either an infinite amount of elements in this space, or the ability to produce any amount of elements at any time as needed.

Now we have number of characteristics of our space:

> 1. That something exists within it.
> 2. That there is more than a single element in this set.
> 3. That it can undergo a change of state.
> 4. That they can relate to one another.

An interesting exploration arises here&mdash;whether the emergence _ex-nihilo_ occurred at one single point (ala Big Bang Theory) or whether it occurred at multiple, perhaps infinite, points and whether it occurred in the same moment, or whether it “unfolded” over time (ala Inflation Theory).

There is another theory that proposes that the

### Dust to dust

Then there is the question of the “disappearance” or "appearance" of these invisible "particles". Where did it go? Does $$I$$’s change of state actually change the state of the total set under observation?

On the one hand, a characteristic of infinity is that even if you remove a heck of a lot of infinity from infinity, it is still infinite. But that is just its overall characteristic. If there is a change of state within this infinity, then it, all of it, has changed &mdash; noticeably (requiring an observer) or not.

Put mathematically, we say that given the set '$$I$$', is an element of the universal set '$$U$$':

1. &nbsp;$$I \in U $$.
2. &nbsp;$$ \forall{I} \in U, \exists{-I} \in U $$, such that $$ I \cap -I = &#x2205; $$ and $$ I - (-I) = &#x2205; $$ &mdash; written simply as $$ I - I = &#x2205; $$.
3. &nbsp;We also define &#x223d;$$I \in U $$, such that $$ U - I = &#x223d;I $$

Explaining this in words, we first choose a set '$$I$$' that exists in the universe $$U$$ (1). We propose that the set '$$I$$’ has an exact, equal and opposite not-$$I$$, represented by $$-I$$ (2). That is, the two are equal, except for the fact that ’$$-I$$' is the negative or symmetrical reflection (isomorphic reflection?) to ‘$$I$$’. ’&#x2212;$$I$$' thus stands in symmetrical complement to ‘$$I$$’, and actually, fulfils the Axiom of Choice. However, we go further, and define ‘&#x223d;$$I$$’ which is different from '$$-I$$' (3). Whereas '&#x2212;$$I$$' is the exact opposite, or reflection, of $$I$$, ‘&#x223d;$$I$$’ is all that $$'I'$$ am not.

If we exist in an infinite universe $$U$$, and if $$I$$ is finite, surrounded by $$U$$, then ‘&#x223d;$$I$$’ must be, in effect, infinite – that is unless you believe that we live in a finite universe. Assuming the universe to be infinite, even if $$I$$ is infinite, then ‘&#x223d;$$I$$’ must also be infinite &mdash; though presumably a greater infinity than that of ‘$$I$$’. This might get a little deep for the average reader, but we know that $$ U > I $$ then $$ &#x223d;I > I $$. Remember, we are talking about infinities in this case. For if $$I$$ is finite, then it is a no-brainer. Finally, if $$ 'I' \equiv&nbsp;'&#x223d;I' $$, then it defines the middle, for $$'I'$$ and &nbsp; $$ '&#x223d;I' $$ are then equal.

Thus from the point of view of the $$'I'$$, $$'I'$$ defines both ‘&#x223d;$$I$$’ and $$'I'$$. However, perhaps the truth is that ‘&#x223d;$$I$$’ is the one that defines the $$'I'$$, that holds the boundaries, the limits, of what $$'I'$$ am. The original ocean was one of not-ness, in which the ‘$$I$$’ that I am, appeared. The moment that ‘&#x223d;$$I$$’ appeared, the ‘$$I$$’ and the ’$$-I$$' emerged as well. That ‘$$I$$’, which is not ‘&#x223d;$$I$$’, appears as a consequence, a space, a 'place', within the Infinite. Somethingness has emerged from Nothingness.

Think of this in terms of a circle that I draw in the sand. It defines three structures, the one that is inside the circle, the circle’s boundary itself, and the space outside the circle. This is the _Tzimtzum_,

This is corroborated by the Kabbalistic doctrine of the Constraint, or _Tzimtzum_. the process of the eternal nothingness, _Ain Sof_, removing itself to make space for Creation. It was necessary for the Infinite Light to constrain Itself so that Creation could emerge.

From the principle of the Reality of One, in which the only reality is the One, I see that ‘$$I$$’ am different. In order for me to recognize or relate to anything else in the universe, there must be other ‘$$I$$’s &mdash; or somethings that are not the One.

Thus we derive the Axiom of Relationship.

## Axiom of Balance

> If something is removed, the space will be filled.

Now, this emptiness, or the ‘&#x223d;$$I$$’, desires to fill the whole universe&mdash;and it will eventually&mdash;unless the universe is infinite&mdash;for then it will be an infinite quest. We express it in popular science as ‘nature abhors a vacuum’. It is always seeking balance, which is a zero-energy state&mdash;or the true state of Nothingness.

However, it is that if there is a large enough differential from {['this' to 'that'](this_that.html)}, some of 'this' will “gravitate” toward 'that'.

<summary class="button  is-outlined">Note:&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></summary>
<p> This is actually an expression of the love that is shared by the universe. Also known as the law of attraction. The law of gravity being a specific example of that occurring between two bodies. But an analysis will show that if there is a large body, and a small body, the large body would like to attain a lower level of energy (or a greater degree of comfort), and by attracting a lower energy element, a small object, it will lower its gravitational dynamic.</p>

Starting from the axiom of existence, something, let’s call it I, exists. If I is finite, then there is ~I that is all that I is not, and thus will be Infinite. This is of course based on the assumption that the totality of everything is infinite.

Having let the “infinite” cat out of the bag, there is no going back. Once, having conceived of infinity, we cannot but know that surrounding every finite being, there must be an infinite “beingness” or “not-beingness”, if you prefer.

> Nothing infinite exists

For if it existed, it would be of the infinite realm, and thus could not exist on this, the realm of manifestation. Everything that exists must have been the result of some sort of constraint upon infinity. If it exists, it must, by definition, then be finite.

A moment on this concept of constraint (_Tzimtzum_). If one accepts the concept of infinity, or the possibility that such a state exists, then one can easily see that something infinite is greater than something finite, and in order to manifest something finite from something infinite will require some sort of constriction to occur upon the “infinite”.

There are two lines of thoughts regarding this.

1. The finite already exists in the infinite, and just emerges.
   We arrive here at the same place as we ended For now, I ask, how or what recognized the finite? In other words, what part of the infinite was “trained” or “programmed” to know be able to perceive the finite, when all it had know up till then was infinite? As finite beings, all we know is the finite.
2. The infinite already exists in the finite.
3. Even though it might require an infinite constraint to constrain infinity, we immediately emerge into a verbal landscape that is littered with paradoxes and contradictions. For, what is infinity actually? Can one even speak of infinity without the concept of finite? Do they emerge together? Can the one exist without the other?

In one way, having more than one infinite element – or even an unknown amount – we then could have an infinite amount of infinities. For instance, we do not know how many stars there are in the universe – though we assume that it is finite. But we do not know how many universes there are! We do not know how many numbers there are on the number line, but we do know it is infinite.

The logic one would use in this case goes something like: “Choose a number, any number as large as you like. Call that number, $$N$$. Now we know that even if $$N$$ is humongous, there is a number greater than $$N$$ which we will call $$N\prime$$, which is greater than $$N$$. We conclude that for any system, as long as we assume infinity exists, there is no finite system that is not contained within a larger, infinite system.

In the opposite direction it is more difficult. If there is only the infinite, how does the finite even emerge? For this infinite would not even be called infinite, but just Itself – for it would know of nothing else. Here I ask the question, does infinite only exist, or is derived from, the finite? In other words, only once the finite has somehow emerged, can one refer to the infinite!

### Infinite but bounded

We now introduce the concept of infinite but bounded. The simplest example of this concept is a circle.

For one can continue along or around the circle forever, and never reach the end. Yet the space that you are creating by your path is bounded. However, is that space finite or not? If you filling it with one-dimensional (1d) points then it would eventually fill up. If you decided to use two dimensions (2d), introducing measurement along the plane, how long would it take for this to fill? If one extended it to 3d, how many possibilities would emerge? What if it one extended it into other dimensions? In other words, create a narrative, then how long would it take for this to fill that space?

<p>Would it not be possible to make certain predictions of behaviour if one tracked people’s narratives that way?

<p>
This is a whole new area of activity to investigate. A predictive algorithm based on behavior patterns from the past. But over time, would it not be possible to see the same patterns emerging. I am not sure of the variance here, but I don’t think it will be large.</p>

<p>That previous paragraph was written in the late 90's. Time has shown that to be correct, with Cambridge Analytics, Google, Facebook, etc and their gathering of data on people, and then using AI for predicting behaviour.

### <i>Merkava</i>

</figure>

This is where we begin to envisage the concept of the _Merkava_, as the double tetrahedron, or three-dimensional (3d) Star of David, that spins in the circle. It starts off with its apexes on the circumference of the circle. But it can shrink along either or both its axes, as well as swing around, filling and “defining” the space – but also setting up resonances in it, that may affect many things regarding its dynamics. It will affect the frequencies that it will be sending out, and those that it will be able to receive.

</figure>

It is similar to a gyroscope in its effect. There is an inner balance that retains our _axis mundi_ upon which all other axes rely. If that gets damaged in any way, then we “lose our way”. Sometimes it is just knocked off its axis, and needs a short while to rebalance. Other times it is actually damaged and needs repair. The cause of this damage is generally “stinking thinking”.

As the circle approaches infinity, you would think that you are on an infinitely long line, and would not be able to differentiate. However, if I was a giant from another planet, or had a strong telescope, I would be able to discern that it was actually a bounded circle upon which you were walking.

    Flat Earth:&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
  </summary>
  <p>I wonder if this is the confusion upon which the flat earther's inclination is based!</p>
</details>

This opens up the idea that it is possible for us, as limited and bounded, as finite as we are, to contain some infinite elements of existence. As was noted above, we would need to connect infinity and nothingness at the same space-time point &mdash; which would require nothing less than pure consciousness. As T.S. Eliot stated “a place of complete simplicity, costing not less than everything”.

---

Mathematics can show that at infinity a circle becomes a straight line (although it can only show this in the imaginary realm – as if mathematics has a “real” realm).

Once we have more than one element, we can begin to discuss the relationship between each of them.

If we propose two points, A & B, and both are static, then whatever connection there exists, will be static too. Although the channel that connects them might be dynamic, the conduit remains the same "length". There is also a ~A, or not-A, in which B exists. We also note that there is the concept of a Universe, U, consisting of A &#x222a; ~A. A requirement is also that A & B are disjoint or A &#x2229; B = &#x2205;. In other words they are completely separate and there is no element/part of A that is in B, and vice-versa.

Now, if B happens to move, it will move in A’s not-space, ~A. Although B has not changed (except for position), however, ~B, or not B, &mdash; the space which B vacated has changed! In fact, the whole universe is now different – and we have no means with which to ever measure that. How disappointing. Our sages say: “The very act of measuring changes what is being measured,” bolstered by the conclusion that quantum mechanics has reached concerning the influence of an observer on the event.

In fact, the conclusion from all of this that “It is all connected.” If we see things as disjoint, or separate, it is because we do not have the ability to see all the connections that are there.

Think of it as in huge, complex chess game, what Herman Hesse called ‘The Glass Bead Game’. You move one piece. The whole game changes. The whole game.

  <p>(29x) The place we begin our journey to infinity is, strangely enough in the arms of nothing, the ultimate demise of infinity. For how can infinity know itself? Does it not need something finite to recognize itself? Something finite to contain the recognition, even of greater and lessor infinities?</p>
<p>
As a starting place, we invoke the Axiom of Existence. This axiom says, simply, that something exists. That I believe we can all agree on.
</p><p>
Firstly we define our universe, U. This encompasses everything that is, was or will be and everything else. Beginning with something, let us say that there exists a set S in U. ~S is then defined as all elements in U that are not in S.
</p><p>
Beginning with something, S, then ø (the null set) is whatever remains after we have removed everything that was there. That is S – S = ø.

If we define S as the collection of all somethings in the universe, and we call the Universe U, then if we remove S from U, U – S, what are we left with? A universe, U, that is “something else” that contains no “somethings”?
</p><p>
A better way to look at it is, let U consist of S &#x222a; ~S, this would include everything and as S &#x2229; ~S = ø, we have arrived at the concept of the null set, the ultimate empty set.
</p><p>
If we remove both S & ~S from U, will we not also get an empty set? So, what we are left with is after we remove everything from the universe, it equals the emptiness. Bringing us to the conclusion that U is at its core the empty set.

We arrive at one of the core questions of humanity, the mystery of creation. How is it that out of nothing came something? How can something exist in nothing? _Ex nihilo_, ø – the empty set, nothingness?

First we need to agree on the existence of ø, the empty set or nothing.</p>

### Individual(ized)

Here ‘+’ is the positive side, and ‘–’ is the negative (dark or shadow) side. We could also think of it as ‘I’, and ‘–I’, where ‘I’ represents the positive individuation, and the ‘–I’ the negative.

### **רצון התוב ורצון הרא** &mdash; The good impulse and the bad impulse

Thinking of multiplication, '\*', as the "influence" that is exerted, as it is a form of bonding, the influence of the ‘1’ on some other element, like ‘a’ does not change ‘a’ at all. Whereas the influence of -1 produces the negative, brings out the shadow &mdash; the hidden side, the below the line aspect.

I propose that ‘\*’ is like force, and ‘+’ is like form. ‘+’ tends to be sequential, more cumulative, whereas 'x’ is more transformative. It can affect the very nature of the object of its attention.

{When in shadow, the light does not help (for ) However, by adding a piece that is equal in mass to the sin, creates the space for change.
-1 + +1 = 0.}

Looking at the operations. ‘+’ is the positive force. ‘-‘ represents the negative force. ‘\*’ and ‘/’ are two complimentary actions. One is the assembly, the transformation, the other is the splintering, the separation, the reduction. They are not appended to a number (symbol) as such to give it extra meaning.

We can get even more esoteric. Two wrongs cancel one another out, but do not make it right! In fact, to express it more humanely, we could say that when in error, you need another asymmetry, something unexpected, to correct the journey, by countering the first. It is only through the negation of the negative that we can find the positive. This is the principle of non-rationality.

Another way, to look at it is that whereas '+' is cumulative, and speaks of good deeds, '\*' is transformative. However, it seems strange to come to the conclusion that (negative times negative) ‘– \* – = +’. It states that the negative influence on another negative, transforms it into a '+', and this is not true – or is it? A fire is a negative, and it destroys the surroundings, but it produces a positive result for nature. A fire ('–') when constrained ('–') produces heat that can be harnessed, a positive ('+'). In fact, it would be more consistent to have -1 \* -1 = -1, and +1 \* -1 = -1, and +1 \* +1 = 1. Which is more like the state of the world, 75% negative, and 25% positive. This is also the XOR logic.
|Add/Sub|Multiplication|
| --- | --- |
|_Positive_| _+1_ |
|0 + 0 = 0 |0 \* 0 = 0|
|0 + 1 = 1 |0 \* 1 = 0|
|1 + 1 = 2 |1 \* 1 = 1|
|_Negative_ |_-1_|
|0 - 0 = 0 |0 \* 0 = 0|
|0 + -1 = -1| 0 \* -1 = 0 |
|1 + -1 = 0 |-1 \* -1 = 1|
|-1 + -1 = -2 | -1 \* 1 = -1 |

This is the concept of sin (_chet_) in Judaism, described as missing the mark. Somethin that requires constant readjustment and practice till the target can be attained with some degree of accuracy.

The adjustment necessary is not towards the mark, but the negative of the negative, which is towards the ‘+’ positive, in the vertical plane.

On one hand we can take the slow road, the one of addition. Change the structure, as in -1 + 1 = 0. We will have arrived at the empty point, the point of transformation. Although pregnant with potential, though, nothing has yet transpired. We have just forgiven. We have made amends.

However, if we apply force, that is intention. Clear intention, and energy, then we can transform this error, and return it to the service of **HaShem**. This is how the negative of a negative becomes a positive, -1 \* -1 = 1. But we already knew that, didn’t we? It seems that the only way to extricate oneself from a bad situation is to embrace it so completely that you emerge from whatever it is. You accept (or submit) to the challenge, and instead of dispairing and feeding the dark, you embrace it, and thus transform it. Another way to interpret the -1 \* -1, is that the direction that you think you should be going in is incorrect, thus you have to adjust it accordingly. Let’s say the ‘-‘ is indicative of 90° turn, so -1 \* -1 would be a 180° turn, turning you completely around

I need to point out here, that although we often write -1 = -1, assuming, under the guise of mathematics, that they are identical, in every way. This is once again a constriction that is necessary to be able to move about with relative ease in the realms of mathematics and its related disciplines, without getting lost. However, if you write -1 \* -1 = 1, are all the ‘1’s the same? That is an assumption that we make, for the 1 is not the actual object, but indicative of an object. Because the truth of the matter is that 1 of anything is never really the same as another 1, even if they are of that same thing. For the actual things are referred to by the 1 are never the exact same. In the real world, although 1 orange plus another 1 orange will give us 2 oranges, each of those individual oranges are not equal, except in approximation – they are both “oranges”.[^7] Because we are unable to see or understand the difference between them, we assume that there is none. On the metaphysical level, each on of those ‘1’s are different, for they are standing in relation to one another. For instance, -1 = -1 is a reflection. Even though they are the same reflection, the one is subject, the other object. Or is mathematics, the only language that can make sentences that have no subject and object?

In fact, the use of mathematics abstracts out all the characteristics that individuate that particular item. Thus it is extremely useful for investigations that distance the investigator from the investigated. For instance, it is perfect for economic transactions, which have already succeeded in transforming real, individual items into numbers, which only speak of a sequence, or a key to other information.

Another side note is to remember that the operators are verbs. Thus ‘+’ represents the positive force, and ‘-‘ the negative. + increases, '-' diminishes. '+' is the crossing, the transformation, the breaking through. '–' is the straight line, the uncaring, the unseeing, the absolute, only one way, I am right attitude.

So if we went off the line by -1, we adjust by +1 to get back to the line. But only after we reach the line will we know that we are there, and would have to stop moving at this point. But there is an ongoing thrust (or else there is no line) and this thrust will cause us to overshoot the line, requiring say a -1 to return to the line again. So it will go, up and down, as represented by the sine wave. Thus this, so-called straight, line is an idealisation of nature and the natural unfolding of events.

Now, this is a different algebra, where -1 + -1 = 0 (and +1 + +1 = 0). In the conventional sense, -1 + 1 = 0. Thus we have to answer a negative deed with a positive response, to bring it into balance again (0 point). However, if we want it to express itself in the positive space, we need to add another piece, just as large, +1. So, -1 + +1 = 1. That is why Jesus says, respond to the evil deed with love that is 70 times 70 greater than the deed.

Because, if we stopped at 0, we would not be in the correct trajectory. So, we need to adjust by more than that, and we compensate by 1, knowing we will have to make another adjustment. This is what causes the “wobble”, the frequency adjustment, the “sine wave” ie the music of life. It is impossible to maintain the straight line. That is an idealization.

What often happens though is we forget our original goal. That is why we need to access the timeless and non-spacial place in us. For the only way something can remain in time, is if it has a timeless element, the Divine spirit, in it. However to remember our original goal, our primordial purpose is to serve the Source of Creation – is the most difficult task we face.

However, another element has entered – to experience the Divine with the Divine. In fact, when we have an experience of the Divine, being a part of the infinite source, we experience our self, together with the Divine. The reverberations of this moment of Grace last forever.

Now, knowing we are not going to maintain a straight line to our goal.
We know that the straight line is an idealization. Any manifest line has to deal with the material world, which will influence it.

The manifest world is the world of materiality. It is the Creator who creates the 1 from the 0, then bifurcating the 1 into 2, and from 2 into the many, emerging from the Infinite nothingness, into the Infite Oneness, which is our first and primary experience of the Infinite Being &mdash; the Oneness from which all is born. However, at that very instant, the -1, the element of “Darkness” is created too.

Remember ‘\*’ works on another plane. It is one of union. What emerges from the union is the same no matter which one went first, whether negative or positive.

It also states that if you unify with the dark forces, you will split and be trapped in a negative space. That is the negativity prevails. Interestingly enough, two negatives upon union, become a positive. So, completely good, or completely evil, the end is positive. So it is the imbalance that remains in the combination.

Also, from this interaction, '\*', we produce the square root. From this we produce the complex, imaginary numbers (level 3?). This is in itself, an interesting investigation. One which we will put off for now.

Another interesting way to look at this, is that produces a downward (negative) parabola, whereas produces a positive one.

## So gravity is the breath of God that I breath in order to live

## Exercise 1 - What is infinity

- Let us make an infinite line.
- But first we need to have a starting point.
- Start at a pt. (axiom of choice)
- Instead of a goal (X1),
- Instead of a imagining something else (GRAVITY), some other place.
- Remember the starting point, ø, zero, the origin.
- Stay at that point
- hold it
- begin to imagine this point moving – while “holding” on to the starting point (X1)

GRAVITY is the expression of the dark energy, the void that holds all of creation. It is not an internal force. It does not come from “mass” (which is the energy) of the object. It is the way the (energetic) “mass” interacts with this dark energy.

It is this energy that keeps everything “moving” For if we removed gravity and retained all other energies, what would we have? What would the world, our universe look like? It is very likely that there would be no interactions &mdash; or no “meaningful” ones.

To understand this we need to take a journey into infinity.[^5] Talk about synchronicities! I have just been talking about the singularity, the point where the opposing points come co-exist, the singularity from which the duality &mdash; and thus eventually the complexity through the requirement of continuity &mdash; proceeds.

One of the ways to derive the material world is to define a relationship between two points. Then we have the line. The line of greatest tension, would be the straight line – of which there is only one (which doesn’t really exist!). This line forms the (imaginary) basis around which all other lines between these two points dance, for between any two points there are an infinite amount of curved lines.

Let’s not get too esoteric and talk about lines that are defined by the space between these two points. All the lines are non-looping, and continuous. Starting from just off the straight line, through the sphere, to a shape bulging hugely (almost infinitely, but not quite) in the middle. Let’s not deal with all the possible shapes that could be formed by a line, non-looping, but otherwise any, between these two points. In fact, that is the way the creation manifests, by defining a relationship between all points.

All shapes on a plane are drawn, expressed by a point moving across the plane, creating lines. This requires a history, (out of time, out of sync) a memory of where the point was (history, past, in time)  

Now, perhaps it starts off with a connection between two points, any two points &mdash; then the dance begins. The perfectly straight line is theoretical, and we have the ability to perceive these points &mdash; the end points &mdash; and create relationships in our consciousness – but they are not straight lines! Now these straight lines form the core of the universe. They are G-d’s presence, representing the /line/space of balance.

X1: Goal
A goal creates an imaginary, virtual line between the Goal (future) and the present point. Once we begin to move towards the goal, a line is created (History/Time).
Principle: Movement – requires a pt. of origin, a starting point.

Perhaps that’s all we are: a “point”, a point of consciousness perhaps, moving across a plane (or perhaps a point moving in a sphere)(the plane is defined by our beliefs (vision)) creating wonderful shapes.

Because each “point” requires an infinite amount of energy to manifest. Thus each point contains an infinite amount of the no-thing-ness of whatever is NOT.

1  ~1 = ∞
1  ~1 = ø - [4]

What an absurd statement, a modern koan:

It takes an infinite amount of nothing to create something. So we are a finite collection of infinities.

In the beginning there was nothing, and nothing “moved”. It is the infinite penetrating the finite. It is as if a quality, a certain something was held back, was removed. For if  >  – which it obviously is, then something must have been removed.
~ = finite = .

This collection of infinities, albeit huge (a trillion, or zillion. How many atoms in a protein molecule? How many proteins in the body? How many atoms in the eye? In the brain? In the body?)
This is אצילות, the highest level, for beyond this, there is nothing.

If I propose something, say X.

X = the sky is blue
= Life is hard
= I love you

Immediately, we can imagine its opposite, or by the Universal Principle of Balance, the opposite is created.

Therefore X  ~ X

X  not X, where  means produces, whereupon X coming into creation, ~X emerges, is created as well at the same instant. Which is actually the real meaning of ‘=’. Equals in Math, as opposed to  equivalent which implies a different measurement, a different way of looking, of experiencing – which is what operators are ( cos, diff, +, -,  ).

X op Y, is an expression of X’s experience of Y, and Y’s experience of X.
(That is perhaps why Math is so accurate, and in fact, truthful. XopY expresses a relationship, ‘op’, (unknown) between any two points X and Y.)
Only if we insert time, can the experience be equivalent (but not equal?)

Weaker than equal, which (equal) expresses a complete identification with, a complete, absolute equivalence. This is an idealization. For, in our world othing can be equal to anything else. For if it was equal, identical, in מלכות, it would be the same thing and there would be no distinction. In fact it can only be equal if it actually IS the other thing. So, if we say, x = y, it is a redundancy. We are repeating ourselves. We are saying … nothing. Saying 1 = 1. Duh! And yet this is perhaps the most important statement of all to make. One of the most basic and important statements, or beliefs, in fact, a core belief, of our existence.

And in the midst of the infinite inequality around us we seek the ultimate equality, identification, the one that matches us completely. The equals, a = b, the ultimate union. That is what we seek continuously. That which is equal to me. That is why we seek our soul mate, that is why we seek G-d.

a op b = a?
a + b = a?
Then b = ø – nothing?
Is there a space where
a op b = a, b  ø
Is a
a op ~a = a?

If that is the case, then ‘a op ~a = ø (back to nothing).

Battling with nothing.

What else can ‘b’ be?
If we use union:

b  ~b = b… no, b  ~b = B
But then what is ~B… and so we begin to climb towards the infinite.
The conclusion is that there is nothing you can add or subtract from  so that it will produce something equal to A, that we can possibly imagine.

Yuliya 1: So, therefore A is perfect, whole and complete.
“And God said ‘It is Good!’

Where are we going with this?

1028, 10^10^28… N, larger, same exercise…

Starting anywhere, we can always get to inf.

So let us continue:

Question: Is ø  ~a?

One moment:
ø  ~ø = 1
Is: ~ø =   ø
ø  ~ø = ø
So  ~ø = 
Only if ø =   ø + ~ø =  is a different infinity.
But we know if ø is nothingness
and ~ø must be all that nothingness isn’t
therefore, ~ø is finite, for it is not ø.
Question: Is ø infinite?
 ~ø is all the creation, all that ø is NOT.

So, although each element of you contains ø in the  
{ {ø}, {{ø}} }… = Sn. If we collected all the ø together. You see infinity behaves too. Because the infinite being we perceive is the infinite being of finity. This is a koan).
So we could express Sn = {S, S~} where
S is the collection  ø
and S~ is the collection of everything else (all of Creation. Malkuth)
 I = Sn
Proof of Orginal Sin. The darkness is within.

That is why S contains the source,  & ø and ~ø doesn’t. In order to manifest G-d’s withdrawal, the צמצום
Mental (M), Emotional ()
  force, masculine,  
M  limitation, structure,  {} through which expresses itself.

Let’s play a little here:

MM = מ = מאם (Here we find the א of Cantor’s inf.)

Now  is always changing. It is the space between, and because of Gravity, always wants to fill the Void, the emptiness. Can you feel this emptiness, this ø, this Nothingness? Where is it? What does it feel like? Etc… (Exercise)

Exercise:
Can run up the numbers this way. Ask which numbers have a charge and why?
1 – מלכות
meditate on the first number.
We know 1 is special.
2 is from the Id.
If 1 = 1, then 1 + 1 = 2, 1 – 1 = 0
So, 1 = 1 is the splitting, the identification, recognition. I am is 1 = 1, the self-consciousness, the seperation from G-d. For 1   & 1  , then it has separated from the Source,  & become manifest. In other words, become a part of ~, ie 1  ~ = 
So I am no longer alone. Eve has emerged from Adam Kadmon, the first man.
[ Thought: Eve emerges from Adam’s penchant for separation. So, this is an expression of the man’s living in duality and opposites. Now Eve, having emerged from Adam seeks union, back to the source. She is not seeking to remove herself even more. Masc -> seperation, Fem -> Union. This is the movement of the 1 -> 2, and the 2 -> 1, forming the feminine circles. As the masculine extends himself from 1 → 2 → 3 …, so the feminine seeks to return to the union, the 3 → 2 → 1. Thus we call the feminine negative. Though that is just a expression of man's insecurity..., for we could use division to reduce our number back to the I. For as we know, all division will end at 1. m/n → 1 as n → m. Once we have the emergence of 2, the addition of 1 + 1, we have knowledge of Good and Evil, of the opposites, the annihilation and creation, life and death, for 1 – 1 = 0, an eye for a eye, a life for a life.

We developed further into the axiom of aloneness, of perfection, where
1 x 1 = 1 which is balance, movement. Which, I suppose, one could call the prefect co-dependent relationship. The operation by which the I x I = I. Would not a more accurate way of representing this be to differentiate between the different I's. Say we have I1 + I2 = I3. This I3 becomes a hybrid of I1 and I2.

1 transforms itself and retains its own id. Or rather absorbs itself and remains true to itself. Remember this is a koan.
For 2 x 2 = 4 (the emerging has happened) and 2 + 2 =4 (two occurring twice).
But one occurs once = one.
Every other number becomes something else. Only one retains its identity in this operation, it remains the same (\* - explain the operation + and x )
At the square, the 4 elements, is the first emergence into stable form. It occurs in the doubling of the duality. For 2 x 2 = 4 (the emerging has happened) and 2 + 2 = 4 (two occurring twice). This is the place of intersection. The doubling of the doubles, embedding themselves in this world.

But one occurs once, and expresses the identity. For every number from that one concept is made of a collection of identities. Every other number becomes something else. Only one and two remain the same whether merging or adding. Only one retains its identity in the merging (x) operation, it remains the same
It is the id in its fullness so when it interacts, as in 1 x 3, it does not transform nor does it affect the object. However, it is an addition to the situation, as in 3 + 1 = 4. In fact, it is what enables growth, movement to the new phase the new level.

So when 1 passes through it does not affect its target. It leaves no trace behind.
Now we have the opposite as well:
Division. That expresses the splintering (whereas ‘-‘ expresses the annihilation. The addition (+) or removal (-). But this is actual splintering, and produces Malkut, the rational numbers and irrational ones.
So that is where the 1 also contains inf. It all starts from the existence of the 1 (axiom of existence – choose any one (1) - Axiom of Choice. Use that to envisage your point of origin (0), your zero point. Which is one that is one away from one. The point of origin is the beginning point. The point that exists before any point (any one) exists. The source of the 1 that manifests. That is why the first is 1, which contains naught. Not is Naught.
So, 1/n -> inf. as n -> 0 and 1/n -> 0 as n -> inf.
These are the brackets, the MEM’s we have spoken of.
Thus one is contained by 0 and inf.

So the conclusion is that ~a is not infinite
=> we consist of an infinite portion and a finite portion!

[The journey from 0 -> 1 is an interesting one. We could walk through the rationals to get there. It would be a diversion to walk through the irrationals as well. But that is the build up to the 1, to the I, the id.8

We start at 0 (the point of origin. Nothingness) and emerge. In other words, project our consciousness ahead, make a goal. That we signify as 1 (which is unification with the goal). Then the movement is n. However, notice that the movement is away from inf. So the farther away we separate ourselves from G-d, the more identified we are. So, the one becomes clear, when it reflects itself.

Now, to emerge from the nothingness, takes inf. For we know that 1/n -> 0, as n -> inf. However, going in the opposite direction. We need inf. to emerge from 0. So, this is why we need an infinite amount of energy to produce the smallest bit of manifest material.

Although we get closer and closer, there is still the miracle, the mystery, the involvement of the inf. to get from 1 -> 1/n -> 0. This is an interesting concept in its own right.

So, we have the goal on top 1/, and the movement away from infinity at the bottom /n. As n -> inf. we approach our unified selves. So, the upper portion of our being needs to hold the goal, and not waver, while the lower part of us, needs to tend away from inf. for us to fully manifest ourselves.

I love this piece. It shows exactly what it takes. If I (1) tend towards inf., I become 0. If I tend towards nothingness, 0, I become inf. fullness.

Also this connects with the original duality. The emergence from the garden of Eden, from 0 -> 1. If we say 1 is the point, the goal that emerges. 0 is the source. Between 0 and 1 there is a relationship, the straight line. Now we have the rationals, the irrationals, and the transcendentals between, representing level 1, level 2 and level 3, with the undefined relationship, the imaginary numbers, being level 4.

As we emerge from the primordial soup, of 0, we see only our reflections. That is how 1 and -1 emerge. We look back, and because we cannot see nothing (0), instead we see ourselves reflected in the universal mirror of nothingness. Remember it is a compassionate universe, so it gives us what we want, what we see. So, we are 1, and looking back towards 0, we see -1, unless we are aware of G0D (which is in itself an expression of this equation. Gee zero Dee. With two zeros it becomes G00D. We have taken G0D, which is AopB, and reflected ourselves in the empty soup. So, because we are not perfectly balanced, the G becomes D. And it seems like it is another part of us, and God, but in fact it is the exact mirror. But, if we remember the 0, then it is repeated and becomes G00D… so we are aware that the D is only a reflection of the G, in G0D’s response to us.
]

[2] is the emergence. 1 having identified with itself, has now produced 2, which is 1 + 1, where the other one has gained a separate identity, even if it is only because now there are two and we actually have 1i + 1k = 2, which is actually (1i op1k).
Now 2 is constantly moving. It creates the first wheel.
Its order is created like this:

(Picture (P1) of circle with lines)

In order for two to exist,
if a + b = 2, then a  b.
In other words, even though, mathematically a = b = 1 (we are still in the integer realm), philosophically, a is NOT b, thus {a} & {b} are not equal albeit possibly equivalent, for they differ in at least one aspect, one element – even if it is only spacial. In other words, a  b & b  ~a. Also b  -a. Though b is connected to a, for b = some part of ~a  a. This has to be true, as a  ~a defines the universe.

Let’s look at this more accurately, using the rationals.

If a + b = 2, then there is only one solution where a = b = 1, for which this equation holds. But there are an infinite amount of solutions where a  b. This holds when you are not perfectly balanced, and do not have a clear picture of yourself, in that a <> b, if ‘a’ understands itself clearly, then it would reflect itself the other perfectly, and a = b.

Now, let's look into the more complex world of יצירה! The next ספירה (sphere of existence) up.

In other words, by its very nature, b defines an interaction between ‘a’ & the place her shadow -a exists. Thus -a must then be an element of ~a. By גבורה is the holy splintering, the צימצום given us. It is our shadow manifest on the canvas of Creation. It is, in it's weird way, also our connection to the Greater Manifestation. This is why we need to do our shadow work, why the dark night of the soul, the hero's journey, our trail through darkness, leads us to an encounter with the Divine. By invoking our shadow, we can reach a stare of grace, expressed as a + (-a) = 0.

I need to emphasise the difference between ~a, which is everything that ‘a’ isn’t, and -a which is the direct negation, or negative of ‘a’. So a - a = 0, this is the direct cancellation of a, by which we enter the Divine Realms. if we join with it, we enter into the negative realms of our own being. 'a' x '-a' = …. -a! Whereas a  -a, is not really defined. However a  ~a = inf.

Now why is b an element ~a  a?
If b  a, then b has to be in ~a. b  {a  ~a } is non-empty for {b}  {a}, nor {~a} nor {a, ~a} – which is everything.

We still have to talk about the 2 which is made up from 1 & ~1.

I propose this defined the order. It is the structure upon which creation turns. It defines the core energy of Creation, for it is the always balanced expression of the manifest world. It is part of the 1 & -1 balance around with the whole dance takes place.

=== I think I have a confusion between a & ~a, and a and –a!
-a defines the point of convergence in the set {~a} that stands in direct opposition to a.

It is the bridge. That is why all relationships show you your shadow. You love bi where bi  B, bi  {a} and dislike or hate all bk  B, bi  {~a} so B = {bi, ~bj} where
∃bi  {b}, bj  {a} – particle (matter => actually turns out to be energetic, actually, the boson).
∃bi  {b}, bj  {~a} – becomes the fermion, made up of the ½ and its opposite.
∃bi  {~b}, bj  {a} – second type of fermion
∃bi  {~b}, bj  {~a} – the nothingness
A kind of four levels and that defines the interaction.
More broadly, it is ~a that defines who ‘a’ is.
Who u are defines u just as much as who u are not defines u.

So we have the law of opposites. This creates the line(s) – remember there are an inf. amount of lines between any 2 points and only 1 straight one. That is the order, the one, the One God. As we become 2, we are birthed from our 1. That is why, if you live in a binary world, a world of opposites, of judgment. The world of singularity would be heaven. The place of knowingness, of union of ‘a’ & ~a, the one-ness.
That is where the axiom of choice comes in. You need to chose which direction to go to find the 1 – through seeking 1 or through ~1. (ACIM!)

So, a side note, when you live in the world of 1 you are spiritually aware. Realising it is all one, all the same, coming from a single source, and you long for the zero point, the annihilation, the emptiness of the infinite, ∅male).
Female -> fullness of the inf.  that is why they are of form.

4th dimensional we start. 3 physical dim’s and time. We meditate on the here and now, and alleviate time. Being totally in the present, we are fully in the trinity of the present 3dim reality.

3dimensions are expressed in the fuzziness between the right and the wrong, their harmonics we might call it. It is the infinites curved lines between any 2 points, that needs to be reduced to a straight line in order for us to do anything with it. So, we enter the world of sacred 3dim geometry. The collapses in the 2dim reality, that of right and wrong.

## For we are reaching for the union with the one, as expressed above

So now we are in the manifest universe, with duality, with opposites. With the wheel (sphere) of existence.

We have creation. We have birth. We have a universe in motion. We have

Now if 2 a’s are identical, in other words:

aj = ak  aj, ak

Then they are the same, and there is no movement.
This is the Level I, the doppelganger.

If Uj (U = universe) is finite, then if U = { Uj } j, U is infinite. So we have used the Principle of the Infinite.

That is why 3 is the formed world, the trinity, the trigram. What emerges from love. Do something for love and something else will grow (intersection).
b = a  ~a, that is the product of love (). There are two forms of love:
, union, open love. The vessel with the light (love) pouring in, being filled.
And the breath, moves it from


 --  -- 

where it becomes intersection, tzimtzum, exhalation, pain of constriction and releases, pours out its love . This it the binary again  absolutely opposite actions. But 3 also defines the relationship, AopB, or e1ope2. It is the result of movement.
Electron:
P21B:

Fig 1: normal, stasis

Fig 2: energy input. External energy, or force (love)

Fig 3: absorbs energy (union), infinitesimal chance of this happening. So, only through Divine Guidance does it happen. That is why we believe in love. Having absorbed the energy (light), there is less love and light in the immediate vicinity. So it produces darkness ~1. Now e- is in love, charged in the state of union with his beloved . But the breath of creation, also known as Father Time, breathes again.  cannot remain in stasis. It has to spread the love. It has become too full and so it needs to empty itself. There is no waste in the universe., that is why it is good. So no light spills anywhere. It has become too full and by the law of balance, returns the light to Almighty and becomes צימצום, . The Bridge to love! And Fig 3. (P22)

4  1, except t4  t1, for there is a time difference and perhaps
, is this a special difference?
So 4 is the completion of the cycle. That is why it signifies death in the Chinese numerology. It also signifies stability. The circle is complete. So how do we get to 5 from here?

## 3  hod, 4  netzach

[5]
Five is a difficult number. It is incomplete. Another round of creation occurs here. It is moving into the another world. (Tiferet going up?)

That is a major paradigm shift. We inherited a one way system, top down  pure hierarchy.
The Einsteinan revolution is the belief in a two-way relationship. That the energy flows both ways. What I do matters. It matters to G-d (loving relationship) . I am empowered.
Now we have to create a two way system of governance. It is another expression of the two emerging.
So how does 5 emerge? Well there are a number of doorways:
i a1  a4. Therefore the circle is not complete.
 41  42. It is more like a spiral. So 4 + d (d is the depth, the direction, the goal. Because although we can envision a straight line, actual movement always takes place as a spiral, which on the plane looks something like

    ii  or rather – a spiral…

a wave!.

If you were a particle, it would look something like:

And you are twirling around inside this. So we identify a gap.

Love, energy, attraction between

Actually:

A moment of Grace (the line should intersect with the point), union with .

This is also the spiral

Actually, it is two triangles: with the spiral defined in each one.

Tangential movement defined as 900, right angle to any point on the circle. So if we had a perfect circle, the tangent would only pass through or touch a single pt. on the circle. If you are “lucky” enough to be there at that moment, you enjoy a moment of Grace.
This is the breath of the Lord passing over, touch one pt. and transforming it.

Time: Whatever the frequency of the breath-cycle. Only a singe pt. experiences the GoG at any single cycle. That is the maintaining of creation. Perhaps in a moment every point is touched. That is why it is gravity. It is cohesion. That is how U and I are created. By a sequence of points being touched in the same way. Being imprinted with the same pattern.
Q: Or is it a collection? That is, everything here is touched in a sec. That creates a pattern too. That is given. So you are created too, defined by an interaction, a צימכום.

From this line of reasoning, quantum physics predicts that all of space must be filled with a universal sea of zero-point energy. Since space itself is thought to break up into a kind of quantum foam at a tiny distance scale called the Planck scale (10-33 cm), it is argued that the zero point fluctuations must cease at a corresponding Planck frequency (Hz). If that is the case, the zero-point energy density would be 110 orders of magnitude greater than the radiant energy at the center of the Sun.

This is the way out of the principle of the Multiverse. In the place of the tsimtsum, we now have the world emerging out of the quantum foam. Around this “sphere” of foam, we have G\*d. That is, the rest of the “space” is filled with the infinite potentiality of G\*d &mdash; represented by all these experiences, that are the lines of exploration of every possibility. Remember, if we change one small variable, it will change everything. There are equivalences, the doppelgänger level I multiverse. There every single possibility in this realm, although huge but not infinite, are carried out.
This is just an example of the infinite attribute of Ha’Shem. For imagine you were the infinite mind, would that not be the way You would look at everything? In that instant you would be able to see all the (finite?) possibilities inherent in each moment. The exercise is in seeing which ones will work and which ones will not. Or perhaps, You already know?

Like a mathematical genius, working out which functions approach a limit, and which ones do not. I believe there is only one correct answer, and that is the point. There is only one correct answer to where the potential will properly manifest. There is only one line. But now, having removed Himself, the possibility of choosing other lines, despite all the evidence to the contrary, must be a constant source of amusement and enjoyment. Now how will we get out of that one? Would You not project the correct line, just to see what would happen. That is also the line around which we dance. It is the way you can just change, just heal. That is the manifestation of the healing force in nature. It is consistent with the view that it is always present. For, the “correct” line is also always running, and with the correct adjustment you can merge with it again.

Now the other realms are expressions of the other worlds. The other levels. And you have the infinite representations as well. But there is only one line from the most complex level 4 world to the basic dualistic realm down here.

For the duality would always remain as an axiom of all these level 1 multiverses.

Journey to Infinity
Start counting from 1.
Is that really the beginning?
Well, the narrative can only begin with the existence of something – at minimum 1.
The paradoxical nature of this statement is that actually, in orer for the narrative to begin, we need 2 – the binary, the duality, this and that. things. 1 is insufficient as there is nothing to know of the existence of the singularity, if that is all that there is. It is then not, nor ever can be, an anomaly. Thus in order for anything to “exist”, there needs to be 2 – itself and the other, the other that can relate or receive the narrative, the one we call the “witness”.
The accepted wisdom was that everything arose from the One, and everything is reducible to the One. Oneness, which is, was and always will be the Source of Everything. Thus we have One God, 1 nation, etc. Logically, we count from one – 1, 2, 3 ... We have wrestled with infinity, and come to some peace in our struggle to embrace the infinite in our logic structure.
It was our brothers from the Ancient East to alert us to the existence of a state before the One. A state from which the ‘I’ had emerged. They called it naught, Ø, the empty set – a place where even the one does not exist. This upset the monotheistic religions, until they too accepted the incorporeal in their lives.

---

Human
We are 4d (consciousness) beings having a 3d (real/mundane) experience. Or experiencing/living in a 3d reality. We are actually livin
Thus there is something always missing, something that we are always seeking, and the only way we can find it is by accepting the 4d consciousness that we are capable of accessing. Animals for instance; also amoral people; those that live in a world of right and wrong, good and evil. If you have to calculate for 3 dimensions, while another is only working in 2, it will both be able to arrive at a decision sooner, it can even implement it more swiftly, while you are hamstrung by the extra dimension you are taking into account.
It is the different between the one who says, “This is in my way. If I push it aside, I can continue”, verses the other that considers the effect upon the one being pushed aside. And feels something for them. And thus does not deal with the situation in the most efficient way in the moment, but could fumble at the critical point.
Interactions
The 3d consciousness is aware of objects entering from 4d in the same way that a sphere crosses through 2d behaves like the 3d object passing through 2d. Assume the object is a 3d sphere, to a 2d being it will look like a circle that starts from a dot, expands as a cirlce till it reaches the same size as the sphere, the zenith, at which point it will start to shrink, until there is nothing.
That is fairly easy to comprehend as a 3d being looking at a 2d event. But, what if I was the 2d being looking at this event of the shrinking and expanding circle – rather like an eclipse.
A necessary first element that is required for the 2d being is time. Something we can even refer to as “consciousness”, that is, consciousness of an event occurring. The second element is the ability to remember the occurrence of that event. That is time – the “narrative”. At time zero, he sees nothing. At time 1, he sees a mysterious dot appearing in his world. As he is watching, and time passes, he sees the dot grow into a circle, and this circle gradually grows, until it reaches its zenith, whereupon it will begin to shrink until it becomes a dot again, and disappears. Now, this phenomenon could occur, and no being, in 2d is recording it, and it will go unnoticed. But in order for it to “awaken” the 2d being(s), it will need to be “noticed”, recorded, and explored.
If it happens only once, it is unique, and perhaps aberrant. If it occurs many times (like the sun rising over the horizon), then we have many measurements and can perhaps begin to form some theories as to what mystery is occurring here. Perhaps the genius arises who can put all the hypothesis and conjectures together with the measurements and come up with the conclusion that it is a sphere. Our investigator would have to have some concept of 3d in order to even propose it might be a sphere. And then would have to have ruled out all the other possibilities. So, although he would be living in 2d, he would now have 3d consciousness or awareness.
Similarly, in our present 3d world, we are encountering the same phenomenon. Using a similar metaphor as the one previously. Perhaps a photon is some 4d object touching our realm. Perhaps we, even, are some higher dimensional being that is “passing through” this 3d realm.
Point
In the beginning
In the beginning there was only the infinite Void – darkness & chaos, tohu v’bohu – the unchanging, perfect and balanced.
Anything that is said about “spiritual” matters, any characteristics, or words, can never describe this inexpressible state, for it is unmanifest, and thus indescribable by anything manifest. This was before there was anything – and thus it is referred to as the (Infinite) Void or Nothingness. It is something which is not something, yet also not nothing. It cannot even be described as infinite for that would imply a possible finiteness, but being undifferentiated perfection, there could be nothing finite in It. It is more than infinite. It just is what it is, “I am that I am”).

information
Everything responds at the point. All emerges from the point. All occurs at the point. The only reality we have is the point of the present, the here and now of the (present) moment.
Every point contains information., what we call “packets” of information In fact, the point IS the information. That is what makes it possible to “see” it, as if it embodies the momemt and the moment embodies it – the eternal conjugation of Abba and Ima – like two billiard balls colliding. There is a moment/point of contact

The points make up the lines, circles, spirals of your life:
In 2D if that is all you are capable of
In 3D if you can attain depth
In 4D if you attain sight
In 5D if G!d chooses you;

- What is the point?
  The point, that single dot on a piece of paper that signifies the end of a sentence, which we call a period, and at the end of a life, people often ask “What was the point of (his) life?”. They are asking whether that was a purpose, a point, to his life. But that is not my point, to discuss the point of our lives. Rather to bring attention to the idea that all interaction happen at the point, a moment – what is referred to the tangent,[^9] which can be used to identify and extract information regarding that point.
  This concludes that every event/object i.e. bits of information is made up of points.
  Numbers
  Primal Point
  Everything points to this primal point, the point that is not a point, in fact, the only point that is not a point, and precedes the manifestation. For there must be a something that manifested, or caused the manifestation, and that is referred to as Nothing, or, more accurately “No-thing”, and in our modern terminology is represented by 0, zero.
  When 0 is added to or removed from something, it does not affect it at all – as in 5 +/- 0 = 5. In other words, everything is perfect in its own right, and nothing can be added or subtracted from it. Whereas when it merges with anything, the thing merges with nothing, 0, like disappearing into a black hole, represented in our language by x, or multiplication – as in 5 x 0 = 0. And obviously everything contains an infinite amount of nothing! 5/0 = ∞. These, 0 and ∞, represent the boundaries or limits of our minds/consciousness! The beginning and end, the alpha and omega.
  As it says, “Out of the simple nothing arose a point”, which we represent by 1. The first point, the beginning, the start of the manifestation. For example, 1 orange, speaks of a single orange, the beginning of oranges.
  One also represents a period. In that guise, it expresses an ending as well, as well as a basic measurement. For one second, means that one unit of whatever has transpired. And that becomes the basis on which the rest of that type of measurement is based. Once we have agreed on the measurement/status of the One, we can then continue on to build the rest of the system.
  0 -> 1 – the seed
  1 -> 2 – manifestation dynamic, the orange.
  Here the concept of recursion is manifested, in that from the period, or step, the energy or dynamic/will that reproduces, is just another step, another orange... then we know there is life, and continuation and, as is sometimes said, “The narrative begins...”.
  One is also called the identity. Every number contains the number 1, just as every object in the universe can be thought of as made up of points.
  And here it is fully manifest, not emerging, but recursing, and clearly represents a beginning and an end. Where the one is the end of the emergence, the two represents the first step on the journey of manifest existence. Seed of fruit that produces a tree that produces a fruit...
  Numbers as Points
  [see later – numbers as ratios – i.e. relationships]
  Numbers are accounts of points (objects), and of events. They mark points. It could even be manifested by reaching of a goal. It also marks the beginning and the end (of an event, etc.).
  Example: What is the point of business?
  Eg: To produce and sell “product”
  -> therefore the point is the product, which produces a number in an account, the “economic” point, and it is this point which determines the fate of the business.
  What is of critical importance is to be clear about the goal of the business. Google wanted to provide information, and it has done an amazing job of that... but when it started selling information on the market, the whole idea became suspect.
  -> the information contained in that number affects the business and its prospects.
  But the kicker is, that although we can imagine, or speak of a point, there is actually no such thing, just as there is no perfect circle, anywhere in reality. Thus, what we call points, are actually regions in space that behave like points. It has virus like behaviour, in that once enough “density” in a certain region then it changes, an identifiable object, a “real” point, might emerge.
  Influence of 4d
  Objection: Already U manifest in L due to immanence of G!d. Rather it is to be “informed” by 4d information/perspective. Just as 3d adds depth and thus perspective to an image, so 4d adds a 4d perspective to the 4d image. Already we are aware of many of the effects of this 4d information on 3d. Like quantum effects, electricity/magnetism, etc. It has a distinctly non-physical 3d presence, recently uncovered and described by mathematics, which also has a distinctly non-physical 3d presence – but, once again, has had a huge impact on our 3d world.
  We cannot sense it, with any of our physical senses, but we know it is there. Everyone can “see/feel” a parabola in the curve of a ball thrown. Without knowing any of the “mathematics” involved, you are still capable (perhaps intuitively) of “working out the equations” and instintively catching the ball thrown to you. How? Taking all the calculations entailed in that catch, calculating trajectory and speed swiftly enough to position yourself in the correct place to catch the thrown ball, how do we actually manage to do that? Some part of us is an incredible mathematician... we just can’t express it in the language of mathematics – though we might have more human ways of expressing it.
  In fact, one might even describe mathematics as a 4d language. For we cannot use it in any social or interactive context. None of our human languages can be described mathematically – nor can we speak “mathematics”. It can only be used to describe elements – and in its lower form (accounting/arithmetic/geometry) it describes this world, but recently it has been describing a fascinating “new” world – which consists of the world of quantum and cosmology, worlds that seem to be intimately connected to this one. In fact, it was by trying to understand and penetrate the mystery of this world in which we live, that we entered into this realm.
  On a side note, perhaps the shamans and mystics of yore (and present) were also trying to explain this “other” world, and were using the symbols and languages available to them at the time. Some of the more ancient languages also seem to have elements that point to these influences – though that might be a reading and perspective we have developed recently.
  Information/Event
  An event consists of the information (form) and the distribution (energy) of this information. It can often be seen as an action, a change, and of course, each event will produce a change in the system, even if only felt locally...
  This event mapping forms the topology of your persona. Tracking the data (i.e. information) flow can produce a very complete profile one’s persona, sufficient to enable predictability and thus manipulation.
  Particle of Consciousness
  • It takes an infinite amount of energy to produce a single point. (Fractal)
  What if consciousness could be thought of in a similar fashion to the quantum phenomenon – in that it could be described in terms of waves, with thoughts being “fundamental particles of consciousness”, and the awareness of any event consisting of a collection of these fundamental particles to make up the collection of thoughts that make up any event we are conscious of? Just as we have the fundamental particles of quantum thermodynamics that make up the atoms with which our world is comprised. Interestingly enough, these sub-atomic particles seem to exist close to the realm of consciousness – of unseen events.
  That if enough of these waves positively interact, a “particle” emerges by the process of accumulation - like waves crossing on the ocean. But if the waves are negative, then there is no emergence, in fact, there is a decrease in consciousness – and as nature abhors emptiness10, this decrease will be filled.
  Points of consciousness
  Everything consists of points, or everything can be described in terms of points. Thus there is no such thing really as continuity, which is a very basic concept in our society and science. However all our experience contradicts that. Even the quanta, the most basic concept in physical matter, is discontinuous, and described as “packets of energy”. Even our conscious mind pulsates, as measured via our its physical vessel, our brain, and has an on-off dynamic, as measured by brain activity. We can see by the example of the computer or TV, where the screen seems to project a continuous picture, but, as we all know, it too works on an on-off principle.
  It could be seen as a process similar to “collapse of the wave function” scenario as expressed in QP.
  Event Point
  The event occurs at a point. We become aware of it after we become conscious of the occurrence. Thus there is a time delay between the event and our consciousness of its occurrence. Think of it as a leaf floating gently on the river being buffeted by a wave (caused by the passing speedboat). In its so-called rest state it is fairly dormant, but once it encounters the kinetic energy of the wave, much could happen to it.
  Now these waves generally do not carry enough energy to cause an event - though this does depend on the event. For instance, whereas a subtle particle like a boson is concerned, it can be affected by the energies observing it, an event like a star burst would not be greatly influence by these subtle waves.
  In fact, amongst the latest discoveries in cosmology is the conclusion that there is immense energy in the empty spaces of our universe. In other words in those places that we thought vacuums existed, we find instead immense energies.
  However, as all waves interact, these waves do to. When enough pass through the same point (here a point could be large) an event occurs. In this model everything is an event – from you rising in the morning, to the super nova exploding, to a fermion changing spin. Because we know that there are either the two waves are in harmony, and thus the resultant wave is amplified, or they are not, and it is diminished, or it is neutral – that is, has no effect on the event unfolding. These last can be ignored, or investigated as possible gateways to other interactions. If they are diminishing – then the event will be changed to something less – or extinguished altogether. These two can be set aside for the moment. But when enough waves interact in the correct order and in the correct manner, creation will occur.
  I would even go so far as to propose that a thought is a particle to. It is the collapse of a “thought wave”, and it collapses also by us in some magical way. One could say that by thinking the thought the thought collapses into a thought... This is an expression of the quantum entanglement that the physicists speak of.

(Diagram D1)

Ocean of Consciousness
We exist in an ocean of consciousness. In fact, we are that consciousness too. Something which we feel, like the fish feels the currents and energies of the water. It almost talks to it, but in a different language. The way our most sophisticated minds have currently expressed these waves that we can somehow experience, but externally we can only measure with highly sophisticated electronic instruments, is as “waves of probability”... and that is an excellent post-modern way of stating it. These waves of probability are measurements of the possibility of an event occurring which we call proton, or boson, photon or quanta but might have had other names at other times.11 In other times it was referred to more simply as water, and more recently, though there is some evidence of a similar idea in ancient Buddhist texts, it seems, as ether. In some interpretations, water is seen as a dense version of light, as light is believed to be a dense version of a more subtle vibration, a “supernal” or divine light.
Perhaps light is 2d, made up of 1d photons, thus it moves so fast in 3d. And water is perhaps 3d light – becoming more dense – though only to us as 3d beings (with 4d consciousness, sourced from a 5d root consciousness, becoming the unified ocean of consciousness in the upper dimensions). This is based on the curious effect of 2d being denser than 1d, and 3d being the densest, then 4d suddenly becoming subtle, and 5d and above even more subtle.

One could think of this ocean of consciousness as a store of potential energy, like a battery – that is why it is often referred to as the Source. This battery can be used to power many different items, from tools to lights. This battery stores electrical energy as potential energy, and releases it when connected correctly to another item. Thus it is with the ocean of consciousness, like a battery, but you have to have the correct wires, made from the right material, connected correctly to the battery to tap the potential hidden in the battery. But not only that, the object that is being connected has to be able to handle the current that is now pulsing through it. And as with all spiritual energy, it has to used, given, released, else it turns toxic and dangerous – as opposed to material, or mundane things, where the dynamic is to collect and hoard as much as possible. In order to do that, it needs to be correctly designed with the correct materials, and maintained a certain way to continue to be able to function correctly. The better attuned it is, the more efficient and effective it will be.
For what purpose I ask:
• For the glorification of God?
• Or power over the mundane?
• Understanding our purpose?
• Help humanity as a whole?
• Because you are called, have a driving, insatiable, deep need to understand?
• To find fulfillment, shalom?
• Because that is just who you are and what you want to be doing?
[ToLx: Messiah]

4d Minds
Could our brains be able to handle 4d minds?
Perhaps if there were not so many mundane distractions, and mental training and protocols of behaviour (especially when in or using 4d tools).
Descent from∞ to 0

[^1]: Scared -> sacred, just swapping the ‘a’ and the ‘c’. Investigating the sounds of the words, it starts off with the ‘s’, of the snake, of the spiral emergence. Then it opens to the vowel, the ‘a’, sound. ‘A’ the first letter of the alphabet, the aleph, the alpha of the omega, the primal cause. It is also a vowel, which gives shape to the word. It is also a folding of the ‘s’, into the ‘a’, ‘s’->’a’ and then closing into the ‘c’. Scared however has the ‘c’ following immediately after the ‘s’. Thus it constrains upon emergence, not giving it time to capture or enclose the inner space. It is immediately in form and fear.
[^2]: This refers to all the parts of my being and all the parts of the greater being, earth, and all the beingnesses in creation.
[^3]: For there are two types of “facts”. The first is a description of an actual event, the other arises just by its insistence, by its being constantly repeated.
[^4]: How interesting the similarity between ‘I’ and ‘1’ in the English language – for in other languages, the word for ‘I’ is very different. In Hebrew, for instance, it is 'ani', consisting of three letters, and in Afrikaans, it is ‘ek’, and in French, ‘je’. Another interesting fact here, is that in English we write the personal pronoun 'I' capitalised, whereas in most other languages we do not!
