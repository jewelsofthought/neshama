This is an attempt at recognising some of the aspects that would need to go into designing a world on which conscious beings could live, based on the "great mythis" which describe us (the brains) as having this particular two-legged form. 

Although there was much creativity, and many other animals and types of shapes were played with. And if they could possibly be correctly predicted, they were allowed to enter the initial design -- on condition that they would take care of their creations. 

This seems to be broken up into various segments:
1. 8 (possibly 11) dimensions needed to create a 3d world that is stable enough to last long enough to produce the material needed for the formation of living beings.
2. The creation of the perfect environment for life did not produce any life. It was too perfect.
3. The introduction of the asymmetry - the snake in the garden.
4. But then arose a problem. The being emerging into 3d had no memory, no understanding of 4d (and higher) dimensions, and thus focused on survival, and little else.
5. The beings will need to be inducted into a social infrastructure (or infrastructures) that will enable them to flourish. Thus the angels taught the daughters of man the secrets of Wisdom, and Life - how to sow, how to plant, how to speak, how to write, how to sing and how to dance. 
- The piece on the XY- Chromosome could be included in the discussion of the "production" of the homo erectus, which is the precursor to the homo sapiens.
- The need for some 8d alchemy would need someone who could penetrate such realms. He (or she) must be special and rare and not easy to find.
