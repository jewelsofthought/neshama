## Live Recording

This is a record of a live recording of one of “them”. The “person” being interviewed refers to himself as a “dragon” and that he is one of the “dragon” people. However, there is uncertainty if the word "dragon" in his tongue means the same as dragon in ours. It could also refer to snake, or lizard.

There are other strange turns of phrase, we have found. For instance, he might say “We are dragon people, we live in caves, and breathe the waters.” Yet here he is sitting in front of us, breathing the same air, and walking on two legs. So what waters is he referring to?

This interview occurred subsequent to a trial that, all of a sudden, turned viral. It seemed that our ever vigilant security forces had arrested this indistinguishable man, and upon him appearing in front of the judge, he said nary a word.

His defence was that he was not of the human race, but of an alien species. This is how the conversation went.

“Your honour, my client argues that this court cannot claim jurisdiction over him – except by exercising brute force – as he understands neither the charges nor the mechanisms and protocols by which they are managed. This position is, according to my client, based on the fact that he is not human, but of an alien species. One, he claims, which goes by the appellation – as best as I can make out – of ‘dragon’.”

“Hold on, a minute, counsel. Are you saying that this man is claiming to be of an alien species that is called dragon?”

“Yes, your honour. That is the best I can translate.”

“What do you mean, exactly, counsel, by ‘translate’?”

“Well, your honour, some of this information I am communicated is in sounds and gestures, and some of it is ... eh.. umm.. telepathic.”

{Note: Could use a runic alphabet for communication. But here this is his inner dialogue...
Later, if it is worth it, we can translate it into the language that was used. For I perceive a possibility of having to use that to bolster our case.}

‘I hear you, and understand what it is that you are saying. Your word might be dragon, but in our tongue it is $$ \P\partial\Re\varnothing\mho $$ &nbsp; $$ \sharp\Finv\complement\Im\pi $$ A name you cannot hear, nor comprehend – as I see. Thus the closest we have come to is similar to your concept “dragon”. I realise that sounds frightening to your ears, thus we will change it to [פרצופים]{dir="rtl"} – faces. That will make it easier for your consciousness. My name is _Chesed_, or Face of Mercy. There are others of us. But you will meet them later – if you have not already. We are higher dimensional, and thus can move around in your world as we wish.

‘You are just entering this world, and like blind children, are bumbling around in the incredible vastness and possibilities inherent in that dimension. Perhaps you will downplay the immensity of such an expansion, but, in fact, it is an infinite one – one that extends far beyond what you are capable of right now.

‘My message to you, now, is that this way you will be able to overcome this force of domination that has ruled you for many years, and now is on its final push to remove organic life from the face of the earth.

‘It is already in many of you, for there are those of you who have been chosen to carry the message into the future. And we will soon know who you are (as you will too) according to how the plagues that are ravishing our world affect you. You have all been spawned from others who descended from this realm, but only some remember.'
