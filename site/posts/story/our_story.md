1. [The Mekubalim](#the-mekubalim)

## The Mekubalim

We are the living messengers of an ancient race of _Mekubalim_. We are the receivers, and now we come to deliver our message. It matters not to us whether you hear us and act accordingly or not. For we will continue, as the when we have nothing to receive and our awaiting our next task, we watch, and thus are known as the _Neshemot_ or Watchers. For many centuries much of our knowledge was hidden, and transmitted in secret to a select few. As it is said, "Speak of the Secrets to one who is learned in all the texts, but never reveal to two". With the advent of the written word, and much of the knowledge was written down, as the principle of Truth reigns supreme, and both can never lie. Thus the truth will always hide in plain sight. So it was with the messengers of the _Mekubalim_, and those who had been trained to read the codes, knew how the disguises were formed, and how to navigate the pathways that our people had placed for us. Thus we could recognise one another just by the way a certain phrase was uttered, or a sentence interpreted. It was like the dancing bears, or the "four-twenty friendly" of the Grateful Dead entourage. During this time, and in various guises our wisdom permeated various cultures, and geographical areas, and laid seeds that would sprout when the environment was conducive to its emergence. Again and again we have called to you. Sometimes in small groups, sometimes in nation states comprising hundreds of millions of people. In this time, and in this place, we begin to transmit once again.

In the beginning it will be brief expose's. According to your reaction, and to your ability to comprehend what is being said, the appropriate doors will open.

There is one more thing. There are two aspects to this check-up. The first is the empirical the second in the imaginative.

We are not healers. There are those who are called to heal, sometimes they are doctors, sometimes they are medicine people. There are those who are teachers, or community leaders. We are not any of those. We are keepers of the Tree of Life. For without the Tree, there is no life.

As we know there are 3 trees in the garden. [Actually four, but the 4th is a secret tree, and because it is secret, we will no longer speak of it]. The Tree of Life, and the Tree of Death, and the Tree of Knowledge (of Good & Evil). And what is evil to the being conscious of being alive? It's death or anything associated with that, of course. Therefore there are those who work for the Tree of Life, and those who work for the Tree of Death. And the two are eternal enemies. We simply say, that good is to emulate G!d, and evil is to turn one's back on the Divine expression that not only are we surrounded by, but are also a part of.

```
Personal Question: If we are G-d's psyche having a Divine experience, what is G-d's need for all this pain and suffering? What does He get from all of this insane hurting of one another?
