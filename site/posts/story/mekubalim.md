1. [The Mekubalim](#the-mekubalim)

## The Mekubalim

We are the living messengers of an ancient race of _Mekubalim_. We are the receivers, and now we come to deliver our message. It matters not to us whether you hear us and act accordingly or not. For we will continue, as the when we have nothing to receive and our awaiting our next task, we watch, and thus are known as the _Neshemot_ or Watchers. For many centuries much of our knowledge was hidden, and transmitted in secret to a select few. As it is said, "Speak of the Secrets to one who is learned in all the texts, but never reveal to two". With the advent of the written word, much of the knowledge was written down, as the principle of Truth reigns supreme, and both can never lie. Thus the truth will always hide in plain sight. The messengers of the _Mekubalim_, and those who had been trained to read the codes, knew how the disguises were formed, and how to navigate the pathways that our people had placed for us. We could recognise one another just by the way a certain phrase was uttered, or a sentence interpreted. It was like the dancing bears, or the "four-twenty friendly" of the Grateful Dead entourage. During this time, and in various guises our wisdom permeated various cultures, and geographical areas, and laid seeds that would sprout when the environment was conducive to its emergence. Again and again we have called to you. Sometimes in small groups, sometimes in nation states comprising hundreds of millions of people. In this time, and in this place, we begin to transmit once again.

In the beginning it will be brief expose's. According to your reaction, and to your ability to comprehend what is being said, the appropriate doors will open.

There is one more thing. There are two aspects to this check-up. The first is the empirical the second in the imaginative.

We are not healers. There are those who are called to heal, sometimes they are doctors, sometimes they are medicine people. There are those who are teachers, or community leaders. We are not any of those. We are keepers of the Tree of Life. For without the Tree, there is no life.

There are 3 trees in the garden. Actually there are four, but the 4th is a secret tree, and because it is secret, we will no longer speak of it. The Tree of Life, and the Tree of Death, and the Tree of Knowledge (of Good & Evil).

What is the greatest evil to the being conscious of being alive? It's death or anything associated with that, of course. Therefore there are those who work for the Tree of Life, and those who work for the Tree of Death. And the two are eternal enemies. This is the "beastly" or lower world of life and death, and the constant struggle we experience in between the two.

However, there is a subtlety here. There is the higher road, which is the one we call "the spiritual path". It states that there is a principle that is greater than the constant struggle of existence, a principle that overrides this dance of the material. But in order to participate in this cosmic dance, you will need to open your ears and mind to hearing the music of the cosmos. That is the true life, and as such it is immortal. If you understand that you are part of the will of the Infinite Being that created the universe and everything in it, and our journey here is to play our part in this great symphony, you need have no fear of death.

That "good" path is to emulate G!d, and the evil, which brings death, is to turn one's back on the Divine expression that not only are we surrounded by, but are also a part of.
