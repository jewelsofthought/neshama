## The Seeding

- In the time of Atlantis, there were the Atlanteans, the Hoovids, and the Nimurians, (and others?)
- _Atlanteans_ - technologically/scientifically advanced
- _Hoovids_ - spiritually/intellectually advanced
- _Nimurians_- shamans/earth wisdom
- Noah and his three sons - Yaphet, Shem, and Ham. Yaphet spawned the European races (science); Shem (the Semites?), the people of the Word (spiritual); and the Ham, the Cushim, or dark-skinned (Negroid) races (magic/shamans/pagan)
- The Atlanteans began to mess with the basic laws of nature, and there were terrible repercussions culminating in overwhelming devastation, known today as _the Flood_
- The Hoovids saw what was happening and prepared for the future by planting seeds. (_Golden Thread_)
- This _Golden Thread_ is expressed in/by Hebrew. [Based on the Teaching: One of the reasons G-d drew the Nation out of bondage in Egypt, is that they retained their Hebrew language. What if Hebrew was the language of the seeding. Just as it had been used to "encode" other languages like Portuguese, or German, it could be used to express (almost) any language. The "letters", that is, reading and writing of Hebrew could always be taught, irrespective of the "texts" that were used to teach it. Only the select few, those who were worthy would be allowed access to the "true", and secret teachings - the mysteries - which were written in Hebrew - but could only be understood properly by those who had been taught the "language" i.e. the concepts and components of the system that they described. In other words, it could be hidden in plain sight. Almost as if it had been encoded, and you need the keys to decode it. That is how the seed is/was kept secret. ]
- Abraham was the first to emerge. Let's assume he had been taught the mysteries by his father, Terach. That was his name change upon accepting the lineage.
- He passes it on the Isaac, who teaches Jacob, who then passes it to Joseph (his rainbox coat) - who seemed to be particularly adept.
- Joseph, steeped in the Hebraic mysteries, encounters the Egyptian mysteries when he rises to be Viceroy of Egypt. (Hebrew - Egyptian)

## Moses

- Steeped in 3 traditions - Hebraic, Egyptian and Midianite (where he was taught by a seer by the name of Jethro - who had one of the greatest academies of that era). Perhaps that is why he became so clear.
- Perhaps Hoovid -> Hebraic; Atlantean -> Egyptian -> Greek; Nimurians -> Midianite (or some other combination). The point here is that these were the other seedlings that sprouted. Perhaps what is referred to as the _root soul_
- Hebraic? He was tended to by his mother until the age of 6. Then he must have continued his Hebraic education, as his people recognised him when he slayed the overseer. Besides, if his connection was only till six, why did he react to the overseers treatment of the labourers so extreme as to commit murder.

## Broken Tablets

- the tablets were what the Hoovids created.
- it was placed in "arks", and protected.
- at least one was taught to understand what it said.
- the rest just protected it.
- this knowledge was passed from generation to generation.
- if only one (and one hidden) understood what was written, the others could reveal nothing, and were useless to any pursuer of the truth.
- it was written in a language that all people could understand (without vowels). [whoever gazed upon it would see it as if it was written in his own tongue - or perhaps it was written in the Divine language] which emerged as the Hebrew we see today!
- when Moses saw the people with the calf, he realised they could not understand what had been written. So he broke those Tablets, which the people were incapable of understanding, and he wrote the Torah, the Hebrew translation of the _Book of the Emergence (Hoovids)_.

## Judaism - A Seed's Evolution

- Judaism - the _klipah_ around the seed.
- _Mekubalim_ - the "kabbalists", the one who receive(d) the _Tradition_, and thus are the fruit of the seed.
- _Tradition_ - this is the _golden thread_

### Examples

- there are many examples in modern Judaism of the same methodology playing out during the many years and manners of persecution that the people underwent.
- Perhaps the _36 Righteous_ - who are Righteous (in the Eyes of the Lord), not necessarily righteous according to men's judgements. They are the carriers of the seed. That is why they are the _Foundations of the World_
