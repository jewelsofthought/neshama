It is good to sing praises to our Lord.
To raise our voices in Prayer to build G!dâ€™s Jerusalem,
And ascend to the place of seeing the perfection that He is.
Let us gather the outcasts of Israel,
those that strayed have from the road that leads straight to the Palace,
and there to be healers of the broken hearts,
gathering in the pieces of these hearts,
cleansing their sorrows.
For He who can count the stars and has given a name to each one.
A name that is remembered and by which it is known. So much greater
Than the task of naming the animals and vegetables.
So much Larger is our G!d, filled with Her might, boundless in His understanding.
Acknowledge this G!d,
the One who disperses the evil doers from our midst, from all over our land.
The safe place that has been given us, as promised.
Answer Adonai with thanks.
Sing to G!d with your voice.
Sing about Her glory as she covers the sky in clouds,
Sing to Her mercy as she prepares the rain for the land.
Praise the One who creates mountains,
providing food for the animals.
Respond when called.
Not from the power of the horse will He desire,
Nor from the markets of people will He desire.
G!d wants His awe,
The filling of His righteousness, His kindness, the straight road to
a Peace that is full.
Jerusalem my heart aches for you.
Praise G!d of Zion,
He is in the bars of your Gates.
