It is not that it is in any way to diminish, G-d forbid, or to denigrate any of the great Sages and Rabbis of yore. It is continuing the evolution of the Jewish faith that has taken place over millenia. No-one can claim that this form that we practised today resembles, except in broad strokes, the practise as written in the Torah, and, to a large some extent,</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"sabbath\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sabbath <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/shabbat/#sabbath\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The principle of the Shabbat:</p>\n<p>Whatever you do every day, one day of the week, for one day out of seven, you cease to do that. If you work every day, one day a week you do not work. If you smoke every day, Shabbat, you do not smoke. if you drive every day, walk or cycle instead on this day. If you watch TV, every day, switch off your TV, and read a book or go for a walk. If you pray, pray differently. If you meditate in the lotus in a meditation room, perhaps try a walking meditation, or meditate on a flower in your garden.</p>\n<p>The only things you do not stop doing are those that you need for life - sleep, drink, eat, oblute (from ablution).</p>\n<p>But this is the first stage. What R' Yehuda calls the resting stage. A place to calm the <em>nefesh</em>, your soul.</p>\n<p>The next stage is more challenging. It requires you to activate your will, and commit. For it is the beginning of the work - now that you are rested.<br />\nHere, the goal is to introduce &quot;improvements&quot;, now that you have &quot;cleared&quot; space for growth. And the direction in which to grow is upward of course, and that is, to improve what you are doing in your Shabbat space. Seek those things (actions) that nourish your soul, and lift your spirits.</p>\n<p>That is why, if you are involved in something uplifting like prayer or meditation, do it differently.</p>\n<p>Shabbat is day you give to G-d. To the other, the unknown that has gifted us with this event we call life. Think of it as a tithe of time and space. It is entering into the realm of the possible, which would be impossible in the zero possibility world of the manifest/real. Thus, it does not need to contain the proscribed, except for those who find it easier, and more comfortable to be a passenger. Nor can it contain the frivolous exploration of the perpetually seeking. Each change, each improvement, has to be explored, has to be crested.</p>\n<p>In order to receive the gift...</p>\n",

In order for this network to be successful – as it is, in essence, a social network – there are certain values that might need emphasis. These will also form the basis for the constitution of the Tree of Life network. Some of these are:</p>\n<h3 id=\"unify\" tabindex=\"-1\">Unify <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/11-values/#unify\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Together we stand, divided we fall</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are all expression of the One. We are unified in our basic needs. That each one of us, and all of us together as communities needing to pay attention to the natural world of which we are a part too.</p>\n<p>Let us come together to support one another in sustaining our basic human needs, and continuing to practise basic human interactions without fear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Unity vs. Separation.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Globalisation cannot exist in a splintered world else it will become a larger version of that which exists at present, with the consequences just being more far-reaching. If any nation detonates a nuclear device, every one of us in the whole world will suffer the consequences.</p>\n<p>No part of the natural world lives in isolation. Seeds reach other lands borne on the winds that blow from one end of the earth to the other. Currents travel from one continent to another. The sun bathes all living creatures in its light. Only in the human world is there this separation built on social and h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Collaboration vs Competition</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rather than competing, creating division, in order to conquer and control<br />\nCooperate, Collaborate &amp; Coordinate to Create Community</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One view of the world is a conflictual view, in which there is an “other”, who opposes. This other could be of different gender, colour, sexual persuasion, religious or cultural belief. One lives in a world of victim and victimiser, winner and loser, us or them, my team vs. your team: This releases the perpetrator from any responsibility for his or her actions or any consequences thereafter.<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/11-values/\">pfizer</a></p>\n<p>For every “this” there is a “that”. These are on opposite ends of the spectrum of the space under consideration. However, they need not stand in opposition alone, but could also be reciprocal. The relationship between a male and female cannot be entirely oppositional in order for it to be successful and nourishing – for the relationship also contains other elements that enable two “opposites” to find complementary spaces in which they are loving and supportive of one another.</p>\n<p>The collaborative relationships speaks of the inherent connection between you and I, or between each and every human and living thing on this planet. It does not make victims, but rather speaks to the humanity that we all share, and the innate desires for a peaceful, and nourishing way of life.<br />\nOne could argue that every successful effort is collaborative.<br />\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</p>\n<h3 id=\"trust\" tabindex=\"-1\">Trust <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/11-values/#trust\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Abundance vs. Lack</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These qualities are determined by the values and beliefs upon which your life is built. There are two different attitudes. The first is that there is always something lacking in life. It is called poverty thinking. I live in a world in which the glass is always half-full, and there is never enough. I need to gather as much as I can, creating more fear, more lack in the world. Or I can live in a world of abundance, in which there is enough for all. And this requires trust, and not a trust in government or other human agencies. But trust in a purpose, in a mission that is beyond any individual's capability to comprehend. And to succeed in this goal, we need to build communities in the world in which we are not constantly in conflict, but find more beneficial ways of dealing with from the furits of the earth, sharing the one another’s gifts, and all that the world offers us.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connected\" tabindex=\"-1\">Connected <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/11-values/#connected\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Networked vs. Hierarchical organisations</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>{This is not accurate. Hierarchy is a way of organising networks. I would compare hierarchy to a straight line. It requires linear thinking, synchronous processes, and</p>\n<p>The most efficient governance is not necessarily the top-down hierarchical structure that is omnipresent in almost all of our structures of control and governance, though for many years it seems we knew no other way to effectively organise.</p>\n<p>Almost every efficient organisation has an effective network of some sort through which it carries out its tasks and co-ordinates its activities. The internet has shown how effective non-hierarchical networks with no apparent centralised control can be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"polycentric-vs.-centralised.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Polycentric vs. Centralised. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/11-values/#polycentric-vs.-centralised.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Central control has many flaws. The control mechanisms need to be domain specific, and any centralisation has to be clearly focussed on the goal – and only arise if it benefits the purpose of the organisation that has been tasked with dealing with a specific issue. Polycentric networks have various stakeholders whose interests are represented in the network and collaborate to produce the desired outcome.</p>\n<h3 id=\"responsive-vs.-absolutist.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Responsive vs. Absolutist. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/11-values/#responsive-vs.-absolutist.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There is no absolute solution, nor “eternal” regulations that can deal with the complexities of the societies in which we live and their interactions. Though there should be regulations and protocols of behaviour, these must be able to adapt according to situations. One could call this the “human” element – mitigating circumstances – and any modern system of governance needs to have that built into its protocol.</p>\n<p>There are criteria, even hard principles, that need to be upheld, but they should retain their humanity, and, if necessary, be adapted for a specific situation. Perhaps someday we will reach perfection in these laws, but until then the system has to be dynamic enough, with a resilient enough core structure, so that it can deal with peripheral circumstances. We might be able to construct general laws, but none that can fit all situations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"transaction-vs.-money-based.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Transaction vs. Money based. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/11-values/#transaction-vs.-money-based.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Moneyless, or money-free means that we will not be using money as we now know it, but rather a value-based mode of transaction. Crypto-currencies, combined with smart contracts, have introduced the concept of currency having value or “intelligence” beyond that of being mere “notes of intent” or “promissory notes”. Other criteria express more of the value, intent and regulations concerning the transaction. These can include value-based criteria that capture more of the environment in which the transaction occurred.

Alternatively expressed, exposure of the concealed and concealment of the exposed ought not be seen as binary opposites; hermeneutically, exposure is the most exposed concealment, and concealment the most concealed exposure. To attend this paradox is to ascertain that the exposed is precisely what is concealed in being exposed as what is concealed, an inherent duplicity that renders every act of uncovering a recovery, every act of undressing a redressing.</p>\n<p>It should be obvious that in this doubly concealed concealment, the exposure of exposing, one can discern something resonant with the nature of eros.</p>\n<p>It is reasonable to presume that the elusive manner of divulging secrets through allusion satisfied a psychological need to reveal and a religious obligation to conceal, that is, to reveal in such a way that the revealing would conceal what was revealed at the same time that the concealing would reveal what was concealed.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> As Abraham Abulafia succinctly expressed the matter, “the way of the mouth is to reveal the hidden and to conceal the revealed (<em>legalot ha-nistar u-lekhassot ha-nigleh</em>).”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup>In the context of writing about the mystical significance of the cloud into which God descended and through which the glory was revealed to Moses, the anonymous kabbalist notes, “we mentioned it here as an allusion from the allusions of its secret (<em>be-remez mi-rimzei sodo</em>) in order to hide it (<em>lema'an hastiro</em>).”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup> In other passages from this treatise, the written transmission of secrets through allusion is justified by the anxiety of loss, a fear that the traditions would be forgotten.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\">[5]</a></sup> The comment that I cited, however, pinpoints the paradox at a more poignant spot of juxtaposition: disclosure through allusion serves the twofold purpose of revealing what is concealed, and concealing what is revealed. Thus the secret telling of secrets—in the idiom of Maimonides,communicating truth in flashes<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\">[6]</a></sup>—enables one to divulge mystical truths to worthy recipients while keeping them hidden from the unworthy. In a second extract, the practice of speaking secretly embraces a profounder sense of dissembling. Commenting on the words of Moses to Pharaoh, “we shall not know with what we are to worship the Lord until we arrive there” (Exod 10:26), the anonymous kabbalist writes: “He did not mention a specific place, a celebrated country, a recognized city, nor a disclosed location that is known to any man, but he simply said ‘there.’ He concealed his knowledge from everyone, and he revealed it, and publicized it to everyone (<em>histir yedi ato me-ha-kol we-gillah otto u-fi rsamo la-kol</em> ).”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\">[7]</a></sup> How can we make sense of the assertion that Moses at the same time concealed and revealed his knowledge from everyone? To be sure, a more politically oriented form of esotericism, to which I have briefly alluded, turns on adopting a way of communication that reveals the secret to some and hides it from others, but this does not fit the description of Moses concealing and revealing knowledge indiscriminately to everyone. Clearly, from the standpoint of a binary logic, this is illogical — one either conceals or reveals, one cannot both conceal and reveal at the same time and in the same correlation. And yet, it is exactly this coincidence that we must take up, if we are to comprehend a paradox that has informed kabbalistic thinking on this matter. In this essay, I will not rehash the various assumptions inherent in the duplicitous nature of the secret, a strategy deployed adroitly in the different trends of kabbalah, a topic I have discussed at length elsewhere.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Instead, I will mark more carefully the spot where the erotic and esoteric crisscross, so that we may better ascertain the manner in which the secrecy of eros can be discerned from the eros of secrecy, and the eros of secrecy from the secrecy of eros, a reciprocity that prompts a doubling of vision, a re/vision, a secreting of the secret, a concealing of the concealment, the mystery revealed in the veiling of its unveiling.</p>\n<p>The central place accorded the erotic in kabbalistic teaching is a theme that has been well studied by scholars. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that at the very center of the kabbalists’ vision — and here, again, I see little value in making distinctions along typological lines, as the central place accorded the erotic is something shared by kabbalists from the different groups, classified by the dominant nomenclature of contemporary scholarship as theosophic and prophetic, even if we readily admit that the depiction of eros is not monolithic — is an appreciation of eros as imparting, to borrow the evocative terminology of George Steiner, a grammar of being.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\">[9]</a></sup> <strong>More specific to the mythopoetic sensibility cultivated by many kabbalists is an envisioning of God’s unity in heteroerotic terms, an onto-theological assumption that undergirds the positive valorization of sex as a theurgic means to maintain the balance of forces in the divine and, by extension, in the universe.</strong> I am quick to add, however, that the theurgical cannot be separated from the deeply sexual nature of the mystical experience attested in kabbalistic literature. This is not to say that traditional kabbalah celebrates the sexual as such, but, rather, that the modes of rhetoric enlisted to describe the inner workings of the divine, and to account for the ecstatic experiences therewith, are infused with tropes of sexuality.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\">[10]</a></sup> Indeed, even gestures of ascetic renunciation, which may be excavated from kabbalistic sources, are expressions of the erotic. As we find in other forms of mystical spirituality, so too in various currents of medieval kabbalah, <strong>the intensity of desire is to be measured by the desire not to desire, the most passionate of passions by the passion to be dispassionate.</strong> <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\">[11]</a></sup> From a kabbalistic standpoint, contemplative envisioning of God revolves about the belonging-together, or the laying in proximity, of intercourse and discourse, not only two predominant</p>\n<p>modalities that structure human experience, as Steiner appreciated, but also two forms that indicate the nature of the divine being, and, indeed, the nature of being more generally.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\">[12]</a></sup> The language of eros, one might say, reverberates with the eros of language. As kabbalists have repeatedly taught, the letter is the sign of the flesh that is the flesh of the sign. Inscribed therein, one knows the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"decoding-esotericism:-silence-of-not-speaking\" tabindex=\"-1\">Decoding Esotericism: Silence of Not-Speaking <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#decoding-esotericism:-silence-of-not-speaking\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The path I shall follow begins by attending the link between transmission of the mystery and the verbal gesticulation of the murmur, a course determined by the further assumption that, in the point of their meeting, one may fathom a significant facet of the eroticism that informed kabbalistic doctrine and practice. The link is attested in the rabbinic principle that a matter received in a whisper, even if derived exegetically from a scriptural prooftext, must be conveyed in a whisper.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\">[13]</a></sup> Especially important in this regard is the talmudic interpretation of the expression <em>nevon lachash</em> (Isa 3:3), which contextually denotes an expert in charms, as one who has the capacity of understanding one thing from another and, therefore, is worthy of receiving “words of Torah that are given in a whisper (<em>be-la ash</em>).” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\">[14]</a></sup> The whisper hovers between speech and speechlessness, as it is a verbal act, but one that, nonetheless, remains inaudible except to the person to whom it is directly communicated. It is worth noting, in passing, that a manner of silent oration — <em>qol dimmat elohim</em>, a locution likely based on the expression <em>qol demamah daqqah</em> in 1 Kings 19:12 to which I shall return below — is associated already in some Qumran fragments with angelic speech.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\">[15]</a></sup> Further evidence for the depiction of the liturgical utterance of angels as silent language may be educed from the Aramaic targum (traditionally ascribed to Jonathan ben Uziel) on the aforementioned phrase from 1 Kings 19:12, <em>qal dimeshabbe in ba-ashai</em>, the “voice of those who utter praise silently.” To utter praise silently is to execute a form of speech that is at the same time silence, to speak and not speak concomitantly, to speak by not speaking, not to speak by speaking. It is reasonable to surmise, though I cannot prove my conjecture, that at some point the characterization of the angelic mode of liturgical utterance was appropriated and utilized to depict the form of secret talk by which human beings should propagate esoteric wisdom. This surmise is enhanced by the further presumption that angels are privy to cosmological and theological mysteries known to God and on rare occasions revealed to extraordinary human beings, the righteous souls who are transformed and attain an angelic status.</p>\n<p>Be that as it may, the emphasis on this form of entrusting secrets is all the more striking in light of the fact that the demand to be utterly silent, as opposed to speaking silently, is not unknown in Jewish mysticism, not to mention mystical literature produced in other contexts wherein the apophatic ascent leads the mind to what can be neither known nor spoken.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\">[16]</a></sup> If the most serious matters are, as Plato intimated, to remain unspoken (and this includes both verbal and written communication), then it is precisely by not speaking that these matters may be delivered.</p>\n<p>The unspeakable, in a word, is transmitted without being spoken, for if spoken, it is not the unspeakable that has been transmitted.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\">[17]</a></sup>Although Plato seemed to be especially anxious about the written dissemination of secrets, for, as commonsense dictates, what has been committed to writing cannot be unconditionally controlled,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\">[18]</a></sup> a concern later expressed by Maimonides as well,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\">[19]</a></sup> his philosophical esotericism runs deeper, as he apparently felt that certain topics should not be communicated by either oral or written means.</p>\n<pre><code>  Note 1:\n  Why would it be any different if the secret is oral. It is just as open to interpretation according to the environmental circumstances?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here it is beneficial to recall the words attributed to Aqiva, “silence is a fence for wisdom.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\">[20]</a></sup> Aqiva’s dictum, which may have been inspired textually by Proverbs 17:28, is not connected to esotericism, even though he is portrayed in other contexts as adept in mystical secrets, the most well-known in the rabbinic tale of the four sages who entered Pardes.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\">[21]</a></sup> I do not think, however, that it is implausible to suggest that the requirement to be silent with respect to secrets promulgated by other rabbinic sages can be seen as a specifi c application of a more general pietistic sensibility regarding the nexus between wisdom and silence.</p>\n<p>Thus, for example, we find the following interpretation of “The glory of God is to conceal a matter, and the glory of kings is to search out a matter” (<em>kevod elohim haster davar u-khevod melakhim aqor davar</em>) (Prov 25:2) transmitted in the name of R. Levi: “ ‘The glory of God is to conceal the matter’ — before the world was created. ‘And the glory of kings is to search out the matter’ — after the world was created.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\">[22]</a></sup> From this exegetical gloss, we may glean evidence that it is appropriate to be silent with regard to the most profound mysteries, secrets that relate to the divine nature prior to creation. The admonition is reiterated in a second tradition preserved in the name of R. Levi, explaining why the world was created with <em>beit</em>, the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet, but the first letter of <em>bereshit</em>, the word with which the Torah begins:<br />\n“Just as <em>beit</em> is closed on all its sides but open from one side, so you have no permission to seek out what is above, below, before, or after, but only from the day the word was created and forward.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\">[23]</a></sup> The reticence to divulge secrets about the account of creation (<em>ma'aseh bereshit</em>) is affirmed as well with respect to secrets about the account of the chariot (<em>ma'aseh merkavah</em>), two central taxonomies employed by rabbinic scribes to circumscribe the contours of esoteric wisdom.</p>\n<p>For example, we find the following teaching attributed to R. Aabar<br />\nJacob:</p>\n<p>There is another firmament above the heads of the beasts, as it is written, “Above the heads of the creatures was a form: an expanse, with an awe-inspiring gleam as of crystal” (Ezek 1:22). Until here you have permission to talk, but from there and beyond you have no permission to speak, as it is written in the book of Ben Sira, “Do not seek out what is too enigmatic for you and do not investigate what is concealed from you.” Contemplate that for which you have permission, but you have no business being occupied with hidden matters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\">[24]</a></sup> In the same section of the Babylonian Talmud, there is another rabbinic dictum that makes a comparable point about the exposition of matters pertaining to the chariot: “It has been taught with respect to them, ‘Honey and milk are under your tongue’ (Song 4:11), matters that are sweeter than honey and milk should be under the tongue.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\">[25]</a></sup> A similar outlook is expressed in what appears to be a later scribal interpolation that serves as the opening of Heikhalot Zutarti,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\">[26]</a></sup> a textual unit from the corpus of ancient merkavah mysticism: “Do not investigate the words of your lips, contemplate what is in your heart, and be silent, so that you will merit the beauties of the chariot.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\">[27]</a></sup> Bracketing the provenance of this interpolation, the critical point is that attested therein is the avowal of silent contemplation as the appropriate means to occasion a vision of the divine throne.</p>\n<p>The need for silence with respect to esoteric matters is reiterated in a passage from the first part of the ancient cosmological work Sefer Yetsirah (a composition that is better described as an aggregate of disparate parts that were assembled over a lengthy period of time and eventually redacted into a text, but still one whose boundaries remained porous),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\">[28]</a></sup> where the word <em>belimah</em> in the expression <em>eser sefirot belimah</em> is rendered midrashically as <em>belom pikha mi-ledabber belom libbekha mi-leharher</em>, “close your mouth from speaking and stop your heart from thinking.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\">[29]</a></sup> We<br />\nmay presume that encoded here is a code of esotericism — perhaps, as has been suggested, an oath of secrecy, alluded to as well in the continuation of the passage where reference is made to a covenant (<em>berit</em>) that is decreed in relation to this affair<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\">[30]</a></sup> — which impels the initiate not to discourse about or to meditate on the <em>sefirot</em> excessively, a stance that was linked by kabbalists at a later period to the verse already crucial to the talmudic tradition mentioned above, <em>kevod elohim haster davar</em>, “The glory of God is to conceal a matter” (Prov 25:2).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\">[31]</a></sup> To cite one of numerous examples, the thirteenth-century kabbalist, Azriel of Gerona, commenting on the aforementioned directive in Sefer Yetsirah, remarks that “even with respect to what you have permission to contemplate, ‘Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin’ (Eccles 5:5), for it says ‘The glory of God is to conceal the matter.’”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\">[32]</a></sup> It is possible to interpret this statement politically, that is, silence is necessary to prevent the transmission of secrets to those who are not fit to receive them, a form of esotericism at work, for instance, in the thought of Maimonides.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\">[33]</a></sup> However, it is equally feasible that the issue here is not political, but rather epistemological and ontological, that is, the need to be silent rests on the surmise that the secrets portend the inherently inscrutable dimensions of divine reality, even if permission has been granted to contemplate them. Indeed, the contemplation thereof leads one to the discernment that these are matters beyond comprehension.</p>\n<p>The citation from Ecclesiastes is also significant, as it brings together indiscretion of the mouth and sin of the flesh. In the medieval kabbalistic imaginary, especially pronounced in zoharic kabbalah,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\">[34]</a></sup> the reserve to hide secrets is juxtaposed to the modesty of covering the genitals, for the inappropriate disclosure of esoteric wisdom is on a par with sexual improprieties.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn35\" id=\"fnref35\">[35]</a></sup> Thus, according to one zoharic passage, R. Isaac applied the scriptural idiom of the mouth causing the sin to flesh to the transgression of explicating matters of the Torah that one did not receive directly from his master, an indiscretion that is linked as well, both thematically and exegetically, to the prohibition against making idols and/or worshipping images.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\">[36]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The nexus between these two elements comes to the fore in the following interpretation of the aforecited verse from Proverbs attributed to R. Chiyya in a zoharic homily: “The glory of God is to the conceal a matter,” for a man does not have permission to reveal hidden matters that were not transmitted to be revealed, matters that the Ancient of Days covers, as it says “that they may eat their fill and clothe themselves elegantly (Isa 23:18).” “That they may eat their fill,” to the place for which there is permission, and not more. And “clothe themselves elegantly” (<em>we-limekhasseh attiq</em>), surely [these words must be applied] to what the Ancient One (<em>attiq</em>) covers (<em>mekhasseh</em>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn37\" id=\"fnref37\">[37]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The zoharic interpretation of the key term <em>we-limekhasseh attiq</em> is based on the midrashic rendering attested in the talmudic dictum, “What is [the meaning of] <em>we-limekhasseh attiq</em>? The one who covers matters that the Ancient of Days (<em>attiq yomin</em>) covered. And what are they? Secrets of Torah.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fn38\" id=\"fnref38\">[38]</a></sup> In the zoharic context, the Ancient of Days is one of the technical designations of <em>Keter</em>, the first of the ten emanations. From the exegesis transmitted in the name of R. Chiyya, it would seem that these secrets must always be concealed in emulation of the aspect of the Godhead that covers them, the terminus beyond the place about which there is permission to investigate and to converse. This suggestion is supported by the continuation of the zoharic text in which another explanation is offered, an explanation that, I suggest, challenges the perspective implied in the words attributed to R. Chiyya.</p>\n<p>Another explanation: “That they may eat their fill,” these are the comrades who know the ways and paths to go in the way of faith, as is appropriate, like the generation in which R. Simeon dwells. Gam“And the Ancient One covers,” this refers to other generations, for they are not worthy to eat or to drink, or for words to be revealed in their midst. Rather, “and the Ancient One covers,” as it is said, “Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin” (Eccles 5:5). In the days of R. Simeon, a man would say to his neighbour, “Open your mouth and let your words shine.”[39] After he departed, they would say, “Do not allow your mouth [to cause your flesh to sin].” In his days, “that the may eat their fill,” after he departed, “and the Ancient One covers.” For the comrades were stammering, and the words were not established.[40]</p>\n<p>According to this textual layer, a distinction must be made between the status of esoteric knowledge when Simeon ben Yoai is alive and its status after he has expired. In his presence, the code of secrecy could be disbanded, as the master elevates the stature of all those who live in his time, but with his absence the mysteries that were revealed have to be hidden again. This aspect of the zoharic hermeneutic of secrecy has been duly noted in previous scholarship, with particular attention paid to the messianic implications implied thereby,[41] but I wish to focus on the view preserved in the name of R. Chiyya. It seems to me that that this view is reiterated in the explication of the phrase from Isaiah 23:18 proffered at the end of the passage: “Another explanation: ‘That they may eat their fill,’ in those matters that were revealed; ‘and the Ancient One covers,’ in those matters that are covered.”[42] Some matteGamrs may be revealed, other matters must be concealed. These are secrets that forever elude our grasp, even in the generation of the supreme master of esoteric lore.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\" />\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"> <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Abulafia, <em>Mafteach ha-Ra'ayon</em>, 69. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/murmering_secrets/#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>A version of the complete text is extant in MS Oxford, Bodleian Library, 2396, fols. 1b–63b.

The jump to the next step, that of a functioning web of communities dedicated to living a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle in active support and communication with one another, could be fairly swift.<br />\nWith $1m, we should be able to set up a community consisting of 20 people, 10 of whom will focus on supporting the land, its system and needs, and 10 of whom will work on the network.</p>\n<p>This could be done in a country like South Africa, where the amount needed by participants is around $1000 per month. The purchase of a piece of land, either with the necessary infrastructure and systems in place, or to upgrade/install them, would take around $500K. At $240K per year support for the 20 members, we would have approximately 2-3 years of money-freedom within the community.</p>\n<p>If we assume that the community will begin to be productive within the first year, then that amount will be reduced, with the goal of being financially self-sufficient achieved by the third year. With the support of the emerging Tree of Life network this should be easily attainable, as the purpose of the network idea will be to support/provide most of the community’s needs.<br />\nIn this period of transition, there will be those who cannot join a community because of other commitments/reasons, yet are in agreement with the goals of the network. They participate by providing energy/funds or products/items that are needed by the community.</p>\n<p>If they are willing to give a tithe to the network, either in money or in energy, these communities will, no doubt, soon be well supported.<br />\nThese communities are only moneyless within the community. Because they will be arising in the current system, they will still need to relate to the surrounding world in which money is a determining factor. One could say that internally the communities are moneyless, but externally they will still be bound by money.</p>\n<p>Drawing from all the cultural creatives – those who are aligned with the goals and dreams of this network – who number in the millions, we anticipate a large number will see the benefits of the network and will join and support our efforts.</p>\n",

In other words, there is a lower level “root” server that houses all the information about its domain, but only a small, necessary part of it is available to the greater domain.

This is where we create a web of trust. We already have a social web of trust, but this will be an object-orientated web of trust. Although this new web concerns objects, there are many aspects that will influence its life-cycle, and these will need to be trusted and monitored. The network will provide the necessary oversight so that consumers will know that the object is actually what it purports to be, and the claims it makes are true. At this stage, there are many regulations and regulatory bodies in the world in whom we no longer have confidence. By bringing a more personal aspect into the network and this web of trust, we will know, for instance, who is producing organic (non-pesticide) items and who is not. A set of regulations is not sufficient to ensure the integrity of the item. The network will take a more personal approach such as a visit by a member which is surely more valuable than a heap of regulations. All the relevant information will be available via the network.</p>\n<p>This is about the consumer being able to trust the producer and supplier. If they subscribe to the same ethos, then the consumer will be less concerned. Checks can and should be done; however the abiding of regulations is onerous for the small scale, or neighbourhood, supplier. Through the personal connections that the network will encourage, these criteria could be assured in a far more pleasant and fruitful manner, while allowing for a more accurate assessment.</p>\n<p>Blockchains can be used to enhance this web of trust.</p>\n<h3 id=\"non-electronic-version\" tabindex=\"-1\">Non-electronic version <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/07-trust/#non-electronic-version\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Non-electronic version</p>\n<p>In order to consider a global governance system, one needs to take the electronically disenfranchised communities into account. It would actually be preferable to reduce our reliance on a purely electronic forms of governance in general. Thus one would hope for a hybrid between the two. However, the prevalence of cell-phones world-wide has reduced the amount of non-connected people.</p>\n<p>A pre-requisite would be for all the people in a community to be physically able to connect. Another requirement would be to have at least one communication device per parent group. If there is none, the network could provide one. Other than that, all the other criteria and methods of connectivity would be the same; perhaps the formation of the network and communication within the network would be slower, though more organic.<br />\nThere are also some initiatives underway to create a global distributed and robust network that will be more distributed than the current system – almost like a mesh network.</p>\n",

From its inception, these communities will aim to provide all the basic necessities of life to all members of the community, as well as to any member that visits the community, within reason. Those that reside in this community will labour to maintain and support the community, but no transactions inside the community will be based on money. All internal decisions regarding the disbursement of resources will be based on communal need and be for the benefit of the community, and thus the individuals that comprise this community.</p>\n<p>The goal of these communities will be to become as self-reliant – or rather, reliant on the network – as possible. This would enable them to become essentially money-free – their transactions could be valued and tracked by a network-wide crypto-currency. These communities will live in a shared economy, as much as they are able. They are only moneyless within the community. Due to the fact that they will be arising in the current system, they will still need to relate to the surrounding world in which money is a determining factor. One could say that internally the communities are money-free, but externally they will still be bound by fiat currency money.</p>\n<p>If all trading took place on as local a domain as possible, and, as is the general principle of the network, only trade wider if there is excess available. In this first case, the wider domain will still remain, if sensible and possible, within the network space. However, if there is an over-abundance available, and the network does not require it, it can be traded externally to the network. This will bring cash into the network, to provide products and services that this web of communities cannot, and to expedite its growth.</p>\n<p>At this stage, any crypto-currency has to become fiat (or fiat equivalent) currency to deal with most of today’s requirements. The only way to make this crypto-currency viable is by creating an eco-system that can transact and provide most of the needs of this eco-system – which I refer to as a web of communities. There is a tipping point at which this web can become self-reliant enough to be able to sustain a community currency, in the same way that any local currency has been able to. The difference is the potential global reach of this eco-system – in that it is able to transact across borders with ease, thus enabling easier resource transfer as well.<br />\nWhat if it also levelled the global economic playing field by paying an equal rate in crypto-currency for work done (proof of work) no matter where the person was located?</p>\n<p>Let me explain. In the bitcoin arena, I have a fiat price that I wish to charge for my item. Say $$10 = N$ bitcoin. If I want to purchase that item, I will have to pay $N$ bitcoin, which is, say, R$150$ in my currency. Thus I have paid $R150 = $10$ for the item, yet in the bitcoin realm, I have paid $N$ bitcoin – the same amount, no matter what fiat currency I am coming from.</p>\n<p>Let us say, an engineer in the US, receives $$100$ an hour for his work. That equals $M$ bitcoin. An engineer in South Africa, working through the network, will get $M$ bitcoin per hour as well, which equates to $R1500$ an hour, if cashed in – an excellent hourly rate.</p>\n<p>In whatever form the organisational structure appears, it will be permeated by the Tree of Life network, or a sub-tree thereof, to enable equal communication and representation – though only used in time of need.<br />\nThese communities will be networked to co-operate and collaborate so as to make them self-reliant and independent of any other inputs except for those that come from the network itself. We refer to them as eco-communities, for they will practise the ethics of the eco-movement, and produce/consume organic produce, produce/use renewable energy, avoid toxic materials, and, even further, produce their own clothes, eventually providing essential services like health support and education.</p>\n<p>This would incorporate the mapping of a tree of interaction of these communities in order to facilitate interaction and support, regarding both resources (educational and material), as well as to become suppliers to the greater network.</p>\n<p>Once such a global network of communities was established, and an individual who belonged to one community wished for a change, he could then transfer to another community, living according to the same money-less principles. This will become an autonomous space, a cyber-nation, whose “place” consists of a network of diverse communities.</p>\n<p>It will be a nation where any e-resident of this nation can transfer between any community and be cared for. If someone wants to obtain “residency” in the network, they will have to commit deeply to the network, and be living on or in one of the existing communities – or create a new one. All that these communities require is for the person to work diligently to maintain their community and the Tree of Life network as a whole. The community works as a unit, sharing resources, talents, etc., to benefit the community as a whole, and thus the members themselves.</p>\n<p>The members’ time can be focused on the important things in their lives and the lives of their community, rather than having to always worry about taking care of basic needs. Thus all spare time can be spent on improving the network in whatever way possible – small or big. In this scenario, people will have enough time and energy to uphold a civic system like the Tree of Life network.</p>\n<p>These communities are both urban and rural.</p>\n",

These requirements are collated and collected in the manner described above. They also propagate inwards to the extent of their domain of influence, and at each level the decision-making process is the same throughout the tree. The decision dialogue is collected and collated domain-wide by propagating inwards through one’s ancestors, and then distributed to all people in the domain. This only includes their domain of interest (which should be a fairly well-described portion of the tree – a sub-tree).</p>\n<p>Example: If the discussion is water in Cape Town, it would directly affect Cape Town and surrounds, and the outlying areas somewhat, but would hardly affect the people in Johannesburg, even though there might be a larger demographic that might be interested and concerned. Another example is fracking in a certain area, like the Karoo, which may have garnered the interest of many outside of that particular area. Requests could be more prosaic as well – such as a source of organic flour, or a desire to install solar energy.</p>\n<p>The actual process would be far more dynamic. Basically, the various components necessary to deal with the problem would be generated in parallel. They would then interface and interact with the particular governing model that exists in the environment in which the tree is growing. The appropriate parental group would co-ordinate the effort, collecting information from external sources, like organisations, institutions, etc., and combine them with the input from the affinity groups. Then, after re-organising that information, the parent group would send it back down the pipe for voting from the population. After that, the plan (or plans) are implemented by a project-tree. At each stage, any part of the network may collaborate or offer support in some manner. There might even be opportunities for learning from and/or teaching of others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"representationvoting\" tabindex=\"-1\">Representation/Voting <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/05-1-char/#representationvoting\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Straight voting on a ‘yay’ or ‘nay’ resolution will be swift and very easily implemented. The reason for declaring domains is to have some ability to manage spurious input to the process. Everyone could or should have his or her say, but some need to be listened to more carefully than others, depending on their direct involvement and their degree of expertise in the particular problem. I may personally appreciate comment and interaction from someone in Sydney, Australia about our current water crises, but he will not have an actual vote in the decisions that the Cape Town tree makes on its water implementation, though he may have an effective vote. The effectiveness of this vote will depend on his participation in the discussion, and his level of knowledge pertaining to the issue. If there are enough effective votes against an implementation, it might behove the Cape Town group to take a deeper look at what they are considering.</p>\n<p>An example could be a referendum. Where the referendum is compiled on a wider level than the af-groups, and then voted upon. First a draft of the referendum is composed. That draft is checked by the descendent group – that is, say it was drafted on the great-grandparent level, then it would be passed down to the 10 grandparent groups for affirmation. Once that cycle is completed, the grandparents pass it down to the parent groups, and the process is repeated until it reaches the af-groups. If it passes all the way down, and is agreed upon, it is then voted upon, af-group by af-group.</p>\n<h3 id=\"actionresolution\" tabindex=\"-1\">Action/Resolution <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/05-1-char/#actionresolution\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A project tree is spawned to deal with the problem, and functions autonomously. It has certain characteristics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Whatever the overall structure, it still contains a “tree” that forms the“civic” connections between all those involved. This is to ensure that everybody in the organisation is represented and has a voice.</li>\n<li>As the organisation is connected to the network, there will be a “parent group” that will monitor and keep an eye on the organisation on behalf of the network itself – rather like a board of directors in a modern company.</li>\n<li>The “parent group” will have a tree beneath it that consists of all those who are affected by, and interested in, the project. All those connected will be kept abreast by propagating the information down the original Tree of Life. This is because this parent group will be connected to the parent groups of all the interested members, and these parents will include this topic in their reports back to their specific groups.</li>\n<li>The leaders and “office” bearers for the project are also designated by the group and will need to be confirmed by those affected (with support from those interested, but not directly impacted).</li>\n<li>Once the project is complete, the group will disband, unless needed for something else.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"disputes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Disputes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/05-1-char/#disputes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Disputes are handled in a similar way in which decisions propagate along the tree. If there is a disagreement within an af-group, then it is incumbent on the group to resolve it. If they are having difficulty, then the sponsors of the two who are in conflict could be brought in, and help mediate the conflict.</p>\n<p>If it cannot be resolved in that forum, and the disagreement includes other elements, external to the af-group itself – perhaps about a transaction, an agreement, the interpretation of an agreement, a principle, etc. – then it will be brought up at the parents’ meeting, and if it is agreed that it is more generic, but local enough to only affect these 10 groups, then it will be up to the af-groups to debate and decide on the outcome.</p>\n<p>If it some issue that deals with an even larger domain, it will be brought to the grandparents’ meeting, and follow the same procedure as for the parents. Once again, it is recursive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"threads\" tabindex=\"-1\">Threads <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/05-1-char/#threads\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If it is deemed necessary for certain information/interaction flow to take place along pathways that require swifter response, or have a different geography along which they need to travel, rather than the default tree traversal, it is possible to introduce threads. One could think of them as “shortcuts”, which, as long as they are useful, will be used. However, if something changes, they could then soon disappear.</p>\n<p>This introduces another dimension to the Tree, that allows for more expedient and direct communication between the necessary and affected parties.</p>\n",

This will require an extra two hours a week from this facilitator – who will only be one of the 10 members and the burden can be shared with his/her shadow.</p>\n<p>If the issue can be dealt with locally, the group is encouraged to organise the necessary resources and energy, and resolve it for themselves. If the local group cannot manage, then this issue will be taken by the parent to the parent group. Once the person is chosen to be the parent, of course, their shadow can accompany them to the parent group as well. This parent group is made up of nine other parents together representing 10 groups comprising 100-200 people.</p>\n<p>The same process takes place at the parent level. If the local cluster of 100 people, that is 10 groups, can resolve the issue, then the parents will distribute the information needed back to their own groups. Together they will create another tree, and upon that tree will form whatever organisation is needed to resolve the problem.</p>\n<p>However, if they cannot resolve it, or it affects a wider demographic, then from these 10 parents, one is designated the facilitator, and he/she becomes the “grandparent” who meets with nine other grandparents to form another group that now represents 1000-2000 people. The process described above is repeated. Thus we form a great-grandparent group, dealing with a larger constituency, and so on, into the tree dealing with larger and larger community clusters.</p>\n<p>This process is recursive: at whatever level the network is functioning, the same process is repeated. At level three, it will include 1000-2000 people; at level four, 10,000-20,000, and so on.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that these parent circles do not make independent decisions, but are there to simply collect the voice of the people and distribute and organise this decision accordingly. The exception is in the case of the leaf node, which should be the source of most of the decisions, and where needs and requirements are articulated.</p>\n<p>An enhancement is for each parent to be different as the dynamic propagates deeper into the tree. In other words, one member attends the parent group, another the grandparent, and a third the great-grandparent group. Besides reducing the burden of time and energy on any one member, it is also an effective way to spread the responsibilities so that one member does not begin to create a power dynamic by being the only one to attend all the higher level meetings.</p>\n<p>This is where the true power of the Tree of Life network really shines. It has inverted the pyramid of power, in that, as we proceed deeper into the tree, there are more people available to deal with the issues that arise.<br />\nLet me explain. At level one, we have 10 people available, at level two, 100. Our parent group then, at level two, has 100 people to choose from (although chosen in the groups of 10). Now the grandparent group will be chosen from 1000 people. If the basic requirement is for two hours a week for the af-group, and an extra two for the parent group, it will require just six hours a week from a member in order to be able to attend all three meetings: the af-group, the parent and the grandparent group. If all 1000 people were willing to offer that amount of time, one could have 100 grandparent groups solving issues that are pertinent to their domain and groups within that domain.</p>\n<p>This is, of course, an ideal situation. In reality, these six hours could be used for a multitude of tasks that will require implementation. However, once the network is self-reliant, and all the members’ time could be used to pursue the goals of the network, imagine what could be achieved.<br />\nDue to the transparent nature of all communication, the record keeping will be such that any member will be able to become familiar with the issues at hand and their history, if needed, to participate in any grandparent meeting, even though said member was not in the parent one. Remember it is recursive.</p>\n<p>It is natural that people will be attracted and motivated to work on issues that are closer to their hearts or needs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/tol/05-4_full.png\" alt=\"Full diagram of tree\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>        Full diagram of tree (modal)\n</code></pre>\n",

This cell forms the basic unit of the Tree of Life, generally referred to as a leaf node or external node of the tree. All other nodes are called internal nodes, and their purpose is to support the leaf nodes. The people forming this cell must be geographically or physically close. If there are not sufficient people, they may be personally connected through some sort of physical (real, as opposed to virtual) connection. Their sponsor (referred to in point 2 of initial requirements, above) must be a member who personally knows them.</p>\n<p>This group will then meet at least once a week to discuss any relevant issues or needs. It is estimated that approximately two hours per week will be sufficient. If there is interest, or research regarding a proposal that you want to present, more time or energy can be offered.</p>\n<p>Each member of the group can collaborate with an individual, called his/her shadow, or partner. This member has equal status, but the two will always work in tandem. They can both attend meetings and be as active as they wish, but in the af-group meetings, they must only speak with one voice. This is in order to reduce the demands of the tree, so that it does not weigh too heavily on one person. If the member is busy or needs a break, their shadow can step in. This rule is designed to keep one’s spouse or partner in the loop, without them being required to fully participate. Thus the actual size of the cell may contain up to 20 people.<br />\nHowever, for clarity, we will refer to the af-group as having generally 10 members – which we can call “active” members.<br />\nThe benefits of this format are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To root the tree in the “real” world of people and their concerns.</li>\n<li>To allow for personal ID verification.</li>\n<li>To reduce the amount of extraneous “noise” on the tree.</li>\n<li>To be able to contain erratic behaviour of individuals.</li>\n<li>To deal with disputes – as the dispute mechanism will propagate the same way.

All those who are interested in change and believe that there is a better way to do things, and agree on the most critical criteria of change, are geolocated with digital identities. They form the essential core unit, the nucleus and perhaps the most important part of the Tree of Life network. We, the people, are the reason that the network and its associated structures are to be created.</p>\n<p>The core principle of the model is: “for the benefit of the community (network) as a whole – with particular focus on those who are most affected by whatever decisions are implemented”. It is an expression of “act locally, think globally”. There are also other core principles, such as sharing, non-violence, transparency, equality, equal representation, responsiveness, etc.</p>\n<p>All organisations consist of a web of trust that interacts with other webs. These webs are made up of affinity groups, with this affinity existing on many different levels. It may be financial, familial, philosophical, cultural, or religious.</p>\n<p>Friends form an affinity group that you are part of: they are people you are close to, and with whom you share parts of your life. That group may be connected to another pod in a web that might consist of an organisation like a department in a university, or a team that is part of a project occurring in a corporation, radiating further and further outwards.</p>\n<p>We are all connected via these strands that link us. The tapestry of our lives and the human race itself – in fact the whole bio-system – consists of these webs that interact with one another.</p>\n<p>If this is so, one might ask, then what is the element that we would like to insert into this web within a web that already exists? It is one of consciousness – that is, of becoming conscious of these interactions, and their potential. We need to consciously create a network. In other words, a network of “conscious” beings need to connect to form the initial network. Once the protocols are in place, it will be able to absorb others who are less conscious of what constitutes the true state of the world and humanity.</p>\n<p>Initial requirements for joining the network are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agreement with the basic principles of the network;</li>\n<li>Be invited or sponsored by someone in the network;</li>\n<li>Validation by your sponsor and two other members;</li>\n<li>Willingness to put some energy into the network.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The members will consist of people who:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are implementing this lifestyle fully or partially, need support and would like to expand their involvement in creating an alternative way of life – one which is more in balance with the bio-dynamics of the environment in which we exist;</li>\n<li>Wish to support people that are from (1), who will eventually join and fully participate in this venture – see <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/final/03-connect/....html\">Supporting members</a>;</li>\n<li>Are unhappy with the status quo, and would like to engage in another way of life, but are not sure what that is.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/tol/3-2_clustering.jpg\" alt=\"Clustering in two-mode network\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>        Clustering in two-mode network\n</code></pre>\n<p>These people are then mapped into a basic communications network. This follows the principle of first connecting the people, and thereafter building the network that provides them connectivity, rather than first building the network, and trying to find or entice the people to join after the fact.</p>\n<p>The focus will be on the people, and the network will provide support to the members of the network. It is built “by the people for the people”. Building this type of communications network is a well-represented topic. The difference in this instance is that those algorithms are usually used to connect computers and devices, while the Tree of Life network focuses on enhancing connectivity between people.</p>\n",

We cannot re-arrange the present components to produce a solution, as ample examples from the past have shown. Revolutions, violent or not, seem to merely produce another version of that which previously existed. A deeper, more core shift, is necessary.</p>\n<p>A system needs to emerge to deal with the dynamics of our global society that is closer to our vision of a unified world working in co-operation.</p>\n<p>I propose a system that is a web of trust, composed of communities of affinity groups co-ordinated through a network: a local, distributed communications infrastructure with the goal of empowering the “leaves” – comprised of locally connected people – to solve and deal with their problems. It is organised as a tree-like structure whose “inner” levels are used purely for communication and decision-making between the groups, as well as co-ordination and planning of projects and dealing with situations that extend beyond the bounds of the local group.</p>\n<p>The basic unit of the network is an affinity group, which is a cell of approximately 10 people, located within a reasonable geographical distance from one another. These communities are made up of collections of affinity groups that network together to enhance co-operation and co-ordination.</p>\n<p>Existing protocols, some tried and tested, others newly fashioned, and others not yet fashioned, will be adapted to deal with issues of transparency, regulations, agreements, etc. For instance, by using blockchains, the network will itself be developed with technology that requires openness and transparency. Through recording all the transactions there will be accountability. For verification in the case of a dispute, it will be possible to refer to a definitive history to resolve differences through at least one full archive of all these transactions and communications. Smart contract technologies can be used to embed the agreements and regulations in transaction protocols themselves.</p>\n<p>Rather than relying on purely technological methods, the identity problem is solved by utilising personal verification, like a reputation-based system,<br />\nas a method of verifying someone’s identity.</p>\n<p>If sufficient time and resources were available, many people would be willing and able to help fashion and create this system and its interfaces, just as many people have willingly helped build so many facets of the internet and the web, and continue to do so.</p>\n<p>A network structure is the most flexible, perhaps the only, format that can achieve the necessary multifaceted platform that would be able to manifest and support a new system of governance.</p>\n<p>This network differs from other networks in that it requires a commitment from the members. If we wish to enact a change in the world around us, we have to input energy into the structure that will enable and facilitate that transition.</p>\n<p>The network will be built from the ground up. We first gather/identify the people, then create the network, not the other way round.</p>\n<p>It is a fully connected, but ordered network – a tree – through which all the people are connected. Just like an organism, the network is all connected, but passes through various pathways in order to reach other parts of the system. Thus we create cells, or affinity groups, that form the basis of this living tree.</p>\n<p>Members take responsibility for the members with whom they are affiliated, especially the individuals they have personally invited into the network. Referrals must have meaning. There must be trust in the web that underpins the tree, else it will not be viable.</p>\n<p>Potential decisions to be discussed percolate up the network, with the various opinions collated, and then filter back down again once these issues have been finalised. All decisions are voted upon, with most weight being given to those that are most affected. The discussion and voting process takes place within the appropriate context or affected demographic, so that the various parts of the network only need take action within their local purview.</p>\n<p>If a project requires more consistent attention, a separate project sub-tree will be formed – a team – that will take responsibility. This team structure will be organised in the most effective manner. Once that particular project is complete, the team will disband until it is needed again. It might be a different group of people that respond to the next occurrence. Leaders will be chosen. One’s reputation will be known – there are methods of using crypto-currencies to gauge interest and popularity – and thus the popular leaders will attract more people who are willing to work with them than leaders who do not treat their teams appropriately.</p>\n<p>This is a vital, participatory network, a web that will connect everyone who is willing to support and actively engage in building the structures, especially of governance, that will support and benefit the greater proportion of the population. The more self-supporting, self-reliant, and self-sustaining the network, the more resilient it will be.</p>\n<p>It is from those connections that we will build this infrastructure. It is dynamic and responsive, inclusive, open and accountable. It is the platform upon which we can carry out a more effective method of governance, of transacting globally and locally, and hopefully, of achieving a better way of life for the majority of us.</p>\n",

And it produces end, <strong>Malkut</strong>, which marks the final stage of the <em>sefirotic</em> world, and is called “The end of the matter” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). But there are no end, no wills, no lights, no luminaries in <em>En-Sof</em>. It’s nature is uniformly one, from every point of view for there is no differentiation within <em>En-Sof</em>.

Thus only by its absence, and thus dying, can it perceive the water which it needed to live.</p>\n<p>Perhaps certain humans experience something similar when dying. If God is the ocean of existence, then only upon being removed from that ocean are we suddenly able to understand that we are just like a fish in the ocean.</p>\n<p>All living things must be aware that they are alive. We seem to be the only 2d life form that is aware enough of the 3d space in which it exists.</p>\n<p>Animals and vegetation are planar because their vector of movement is planar.</p>\n<p>For instance, one might think of a tree as a 3D composition, but its thrust, its dynamic, i.e. its mode of growth, is 2D. For it is essentially linear, with its convolutions being due to environmental and other constraints.</p>\n<p>That is a branch grows in essentially a straight line, a vector that has a &quot;goal&quot;/direction, and is shaped by environmental influences, emerging not quite as straight as it was meant to be.</p>\n<p>Similarly an animal, running on the earth lives essentially on the plane. One sees it with a deer trying to escape from a lion. Most of its evasive manoeuvres are angular - unless the need arises to go around something.</p>\n<p>Birds &amp; fish experience an 2D but in an extra dimension. In other words they can experience the 3 axes but as 2D planes.

Have nothing to do with such people” (2 Timothy 3:1-5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"love\" tabindex=\"-1\">Love <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love/#love\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>For those .<br />\nEvery culture – that acknowledges the concept of love – sees love in a certain way. Especially in the cultures of romance, it is seen as something that will heal all emotional wounds, and will bond our souls—allowing us to live happily ever after. But, as has been noted, these stories often end with the two lovers walking off, hand-in-hand, into the sunset... They do not walk in to the dawn, but the darkness. For it is when you encounter the dark night of your lover's soul that the work begins -</p>\n<p>Perhaps we are only looking at a one dimensional version of the story - the simplest one, and the easiest to grasp. Love is as complex and many-varied as the human soul—seeing as genuine love is, as we all know, food for the soul. However, just as there are many types of &quot;food&quot;, some processed, some natural, there are as many types of &quot;soul food&quot;, and though some of it might sail under the flag of love, it is certainly not loving!</p>\n<p>The reality is that we have to accept the basic fact of duality, and thus complementarity. That is, if there is an up, there is also a down. Thus, as love can bring us to great heights, it can also cause us to experience deep pain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"energy\" tabindex=\"-1\">Energy <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love/#energy\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What if we looked at what we refer to as love as, firstly, and foremost, as energy. Energy that emerges between two (or more) people. Because, if we take it at its most basic, it enervates, it awakens, it stimulates - it is love(ly)!</p>\n<p>However, energy is amoral. It just is, and it just does what it does. For instance, electrical energy...</p>\n<p>Thus, in the end, it will stimulate your feelings making them more intense, more overpowering. You will have &quot;fallen&quot; in love, and experience uncontrollable feelings of love... and perhaps hate... and anger... and resentment... and shame... and jealousy!?</p>\n<p>Think of love as white light, born untainted, pure and innocent, that splinters into the many colours of existence upon encountering the prism of the lovers' souls. For love seems to contain within it all the flavours of the human soul experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"max-love\" tabindex=\"-1\">Max love <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love/#max-love\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here is a primary question of our time: How many people is the maximum that a person can truly love? This includes all the <a href=\"https://neshama.com/site/posts/neshama/love_greek.md\">different types of love</a>. ]How would one go about answering this question, or showing that there is no answer to this question? We know the lower bound is one - that which we call self-love. [Once again, the paradox of 2. When we say self-love, it is actually love of 2, the other is just you, yourself. So, the truth is that love must begin with two, though it starts of at one.</p>\n<p>It also seems also know logically, that there must be an upper bound.</p>\n<p>Tests have been done, that show that the maximum amount of parallel tasks a human can preform at the same time is around seven. Like writing seven letters simultaneously. Yet, no research has been done into love. Perhaps we prefer it to be a mystery - that way it allows for more leeway. Seven might be a good starting place for an upper bound.</p>\n<p>However or whatever we approach this question, what it emphasises is that we find ourselves in the uncomfortable position &quot;knowing&quot; what love is, yet no-one really knowing what it is.</p>\n<p>True love is in the interesting position of only being known by experiencing it. Does Truth have the same modicum?</p>\n<p>Because, in the end, love is a feeling... Now, the question becomes.... what is a feeling? Presenting us with the same difficulty as before. What are we really talking about here?</p>\n",

It is like a regular map of the world that we see in atlases (or on the screen), which is a 2d version of a 3d event - the earth, and, as such, is not true.</p>\n<p>And how to find words to express such an experience?</p>\n<h2 id=\"god\" tabindex=\"-1\">God <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/homoerotic/#god\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If I am unsure that there is a God, or if I will even exist after this life, then why not attain whatever I am able in this life, however I obtain it, and deal with what comes after, if anything, when it happens?<br />\nThis is a far more pragmatic and realistic approach than the &quot;spiritual&quot; or even &quot;tribal&quot;. If there is God, and He has sent me down here and this is what I am, to the best of my ability, capable of doing, then for what will he be punishing me? Is not my striving to achieve the best I can with what I have been given what I need to be doing?</p>\n<p>Because, it seems, even the best of us have our &quot;dark&quot; corners... And that is what we are afraid of. If we become aware of that darkness, then we have allowed it into our lives, but, if we spend our whole lives fighting it, then how can we achieve the best that we can achieve in the limited time we have?</p>\n<p>Unless one turns that around, and says that all one's actual task is, is to fight against the evil, that begins in your own mind!<br />\nWhich is essentially what all mystics and religions actually say. Anything else is socio-political, because this is the actually the most revolutionary act that one can take in the society. It is an act of sovereignty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finite-event\" tabindex=\"-1\">Finite event <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/homoerotic/#finite-event\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Even if the finite being was part of an infinite event, it could (by definition) only be a partial representation of that infinity. Each step down from a higher dimension, requires the &quot;removal&quot; of an infinity! Or more benignly, the reduction of an infinite aspect of that higher dimensional object to zero (0).</p>\n<p>Conversely, for the lower dimensional object to perceive a higher dimensional object, it would need to embrace an extra aspect of the infinite. That, however, requires two prerequisites:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That it has the desire to see this aspect.</li>\n<li>That it has the capacity to perceive this extra &quot;dimension&quot;/infinity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Would not such an experience be expressed as &quot;miraculous&quot;?</p>\n<h2 id=\"hurdle-of-language\" tabindex=\"-1\">Hurdle of Language <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/homoerotic/#hurdle-of-language\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This has the major hurdle of Language: how to express the inexpressible? In addition, it would be impossible for the finite to in any way encapsulate and experience of the infinite. For if there is a whole infinity that has not been explored, how can one express those things that have not even been perceived, let alone explored? How would one be able to express such a meeting?</p>\n<p>Thus the depth of the journey can only be as deep as the symbols that one has to &quot;guide&quot; one on the journey, and, upon return, the icons that one finds/creates/adopts to express the ineffable experience. This is a selfless task, best expressed by the principle of there those are who have had this experience (esoteric) and those who have not (exoteric).</p>\n<h2 id=\"cross\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cross <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/homoerotic/#cross\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Jesus on the Cross is the wrong image, it is, in essence, homo-erotic,<br />\nthough that is not the primary reason for its incorrectness</p>\n<h2 id=\"home-erotic\" tabindex=\"-1\">Home-erotic <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/homoerotic/#home-erotic\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This it would be claimed, would be too erotic, and unsuitable for young minds, especially if she was half-naked, as would be expected. But not for the homosexually inclined. This could be a easily eroticised, just as erotic as a half-naked, young, lovely for women to a normal man<br />\nHowever, if the female is to take her place beside the male in any discourse regarding the future of our society, and its norms of behaviour, she will have to be at least equal in any narrative on which this is built. Thus we have to change the narrative, and could call this decade 2020's, the New Narrative</p>\n<p>It is filled with signs and portends: 2020 itself is indicative of a square (4), and 20x20. Square: 4 legs, 20x20, stable.</p>\n<p>This new narrative has to begin with the question of why is the Messiah a man? Is it because God is a man? Is it because God is man's creation?</p>\n<h2 id=\"female\" tabindex=\"-1\">Female <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/homoerotic/#female\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>However, the female ravaged, the female crucified, is a much better representation of what has been happening in the world, and what is still occurring. It is not that it is only happening to the women. We know it is happening to the elderly, the poor, the children, the sick, the mentally/emotionally ill, and the economically distressed. But the point is, the essence of it is, is that it is essentially male dominated - in that it is men who are mainly perpetuating it. [With a strange narcissistic edge to it, as evidenced by the continuous homoerotic elements throughout the ages.]</p>\n<p>The Jesus narrative, with the symbol of a man hanging bleeding and tormented on the cross, is just a narcissistic image of deep male anguish - a reflection/perception/expression of this dark depth of a male's soul expression. Essentially it is male gazing on male and his male narrative, with the women kneeling weeping at his feet - props in his, the male's, grand narrative.</p>\n<p>But to show the weak, the earth, the soft, the very womb and bosoms upon which we are all nurtured being torn and ravaged by these male sycophants would create a new narrative.</p>\n<h2 id=\"power-fantasies\" tabindex=\"-1\">Power fantasies <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/homoerotic/#power-fantasies\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It seems that the lower fantasies are far more tangible, and thus perhaps attainable - and that is the essence of their attraction</p>\n<p>Power fantasies: -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>lower: rape, enslave, control</li>\n<li>upper: control over oneself, balance in dealings with others,</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"good-and-evil\" tabindex=\"-1\">Good and evil <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/homoerotic/#good-and-evil\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The essential difference between good and evil - good gives us a choce, evil never does.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now we don't know how much of each there is, nor even how it is distributed in this world. We just know that it is, and it is everywhere!</p>\n<p>In fact, the best we can do, is to build bubbles of space &amp; time that contain the good (and thus bubbles that also &quot;contain&quot; the evil).</p>\n<p>Let's change perspective, and look at this representation as one that speaks of &quot;how evil, or how good?&quot;. And let's look at it this way:<br />\nThere will be at least one spot where truly and unadulterated evil can exist just as there is at least one spot where the true pure good can exist. And these two spots define the extent of the world of good and evil. They define the boundary of the domain of good &amp; evil. What exists beyond? Well, in the realm of the infinite infinities, or the infinitely infinite, or the infinity of infinites.... who knows?</p>\n<p>Returning to the circle, this circle defines the place of the purest of good &amp; evil, and inside the circle are all the different gradations of good and evil - the benonim (inbetweeners). In essence, the whole narrative is about us, the Benonim, the &quot;average&quot;, the &quot;normal&quot; - for we make up the vast majority of human existence.</p>\n<p>You could say that if someone is purely good, then there is nothing that needs to be done. They will live a completely sovereign existence according to their inner edicts, and nothing can shake them or divert them...</p>\n<p>However, in the same way, if someone is truly evil, he is driven also by inner compulsion, and will influence all those around them, and those that he cannot influence - he will eliminate. And this is what makes him a potent force of evil.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, it is one of the reasons we say that God is good - because he gives us a choice of whether to follow the impulse to Good or that to Evil.</p>\n<p>The burning question of existence then becomes, if God is the creator of the universe, and therefore omnipotent, was he not the one who created evil in the first place? Why,... God? Why? That is a difficult question, perhaps THE question, especially in the midst of this inner battle of the Benoni between good and evil.</p>\n<p>And however you answer it will affect how you live your life, and much of the consequences thereof. Whether for/by yourself, or because of your belief in omeones else's answer.</p>\n",

That is, although I live my life, something else—the same something that somehow enabled me to now awaken in this &quot;place&quot;—will at some unknown point, once again remove this particular awareness that I am now expressing (by writing this – for instance).</p>\n<p>This I-ness is not yet an aware $I$. It is just conscious of its I-ness. For this $i$, it's I-ness is a fact (or life, one could say). It takes many years (six or so, I believe), for the 'i' to become aware of its I. And it actually only becomes real, upon authentically encountering another I - which will generally happen through love, if 1 is lucky enough to experience it.<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/zero_one/I.html\">The journey of the I</a></p>\n<p>My story begins with the one I am becoming, in the all that 'I am not'. Now, one thing one know(s), is that there was a time when there was no-one. As far as one was concerned, there was no other one, 'no-thing', at very least, no one. So one decided to give itself a name, and called itself Point. So we say that this one can be represent ed by a point.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/zero_one/excluded_mid.html\">excluded_middle</a>{This is also an expression of what is known as the principle of the excluded middle: if P then there exists a ~P. For everything that exists there is an equal and opposite, if only in potential. Or, with something everyone is familiar with: &quot;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction&quot;. This applies to energy, but I propose that it applies to everything - though not necessarily equal and opposite by our standards of measurement.}</p>\n<p>Another way of looking at it, is that every shape has a positive version and a negative one. For instance the triangle has both an inner triangle, and an outer one. Why is this a positive and a negative? Well, if we think from the perspective of the triangle, then everything inside the triangle is part of triangle, and everything outside of triangle is out of triangle, like $t+$ and $t-$.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/qkab/triangle-neg.png\" alt=\"Pos/Neg triangle\" /></p>\n<p>This other I, we give the concept of 0, or zero - nothingness. Before I existed, what was there? When I don't exist anymore, what is there? So, we signify the other as 0, and the I, the point of existence, as 1. And this point 0, we can also represent as a point, or rather the non-point (or place).</p>\n<p>Thus we have two points, 0 &amp; 1, and the &quot;line&quot; or space/time between them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unpack\" tabindex=\"-1\">Unpack <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/zero_one/#unpack\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Start with number 1 (me, I). Think of it as a moment in &quot;time&quot; in which I (1) appear(s).</p>\n<p>If 1 is aware, then there must have been a time when 1 was unaware, and as such, 1 did not exist, and that point we can represent as 0. In fact, we can represent this occurrence as 1 - 1 = 0.</p>\n<p>This is a statement we are all familiar with. But if we break it down philosophically, it reads something like: If we remove (subtract) the 1 which has appeared, with another 1, then we will, in essence, have annihilated the 1st 1, and produced nothing, or emptiness, which is 0 - nothingness.</p>\n<p>Now we have a 1, and a 0 - something &amp; nothing. As well as an action (subtraction), from which we can almost propose the state of nothingness. Using our previous formulation, we could say the for every 1, there is a not-1, or ~1. So there naturally needs to be a process by which we can merge them somehow.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, by only having the basic process of addition, '+', which is easily followed, by the example of if I have an apple, and you give me another apple then I have in my basket, 2 apples, an apple plus another apple... That is quite natural.</p>\n<p>For the previous case, I could rephrase my statement as<br />\n1 + (~1). Which says: If I have an apple in my basket, and I add a &quot;non-apple&quot; to it, it will cancel out the apple and I will have an empty basket.</p>\n<h2 id=\"complimentarity\" tabindex=\"-1\">Complimentarity <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/zero_one/#complimentarity\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This also illustrates the Principle of the Anti, or the: &quot;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction&quot;, illustrated also in quantum theory, where for sub-atomic particle, there exists an anti-particle.</p>\n<p>I extend the statement to: &quot;For every object in the universe, there is an equal and opposite object&quot;. And I use the example of the triangle to show this (see fig on left, and refer to 'The 3 spaces' page).</p>\n",

It is a mystery as to how the infinite can manifest something perceived as finite. And it is just as amazing for the finite being to even try to postulate an infinite consciousness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wave-of-consciousness\" tabindex=\"-1\">Wave of consciousness <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/#wave-of-consciousness\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/qkab/Diagram%20Kab4%20-%20Wave.png\" alt=\"Wave of Time\" /></p>\n<p>Because we awaken here, in this wave, we can only begin to work from this space. Just as G!d started from a point, and expanded equally, producing the sphere, so we “start” from a point in G!d’s consciousness, except that we are not so fortunate as to expand equally from the centre, but expand according to environmental and inherited conditions, but expand we do, nevertheless.</p>\n<p>In the Divine realm, it could be said that the point and the circle emerged simultaneously, for it occurred in a place without time nor space.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/qkab/Diagram%20Kab5%20-%20Human%20Consciousness.png\" alt=\"Human Consciousness\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"in-the-beginning\" tabindex=\"-1\">In the beginning <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/#in-the-beginning\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In the beginning there was only the infinite void – darkness, chaos, <em>tohu v’bohu</em> – the unchanging, perfect, balanced. Anything said about it, any characteristics describing it, can never express this inexpressible state – for it is unmanifest and thus indescribable.<br />\nThis was what was before there was anything. It is something that is not something, yet also not nothing. It has been described as the Void or Infinite Light. It is only described as infinite from a finite perspective. How would the infinite describe itself to us? “I am that I am” or “I will be what I will be”... or is it “I was what I will be” or “I am what I was never”?</p>\n<p>Out of this infinite, endless nothingness something arose, a beginning, and we call it a ‘point’. Because the Void is perfect and balanced (all human terms), this emanation occurred in all directions simultaneously – which will create a space which is represented by a ‘circle’. Thus this point is called the middle point, the point of origin <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/dimensions.html\">Math/Dim</a>.</p>\n<p>It is possible that many (perhaps an infinite amount of) points arose simultaneously. However, one of them is the point of origin of whatever circle is under investigation. Mathematics uses different language. It states (and proves) that it if there are many points, it is unimportant which point is chosen, and calls it the axiom of existence.</p>\n<p>If I may digress for a moment, and propose that each of us has a ‘point of origin’, a beginning. Thus, although each one of us may be gazing at the same event/object, each ‘point’ will have a different ‘point of view’.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-point-of-density\" tabindex=\"-1\">A point of density <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/#a-point-of-density\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Imagine a spot of density – the middle point.</p>\n<p>What is that point? It is a point of finity – the emergence of which takes an infinite amount of “energy”. One could say that it takes a infinity to produce a single finite point, and the mystery of the circle – which could be thought of as an expanded point (or a point could be thought of as a tiny circle – which is close to what we observe, as the particles that make up our world are not points at all, but “fields of influence”. This mystery of the circle speaks of the mystery by which the unbounded infinite becomes the bounded finite – creation ex-nihilo. The emergence of something from other; the source is different from the result, there being no correlation between cause and effect.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-middle-point\" tabindex=\"-1\">The middle point <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/#the-middle-point\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>From the middle point the universe emerged. We refer to it as the ‘big bang’. There is a version of this creation story that speaks of many big bangs occurring simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Everything starts of as a ‘point’. A point just represents presence and thus position. Nothing has yet ‘manifested’. It is just ‘in position’. Similar to voltage, which is ‘potential’ energy, and is ready to manifest as soon as it is hooked up to a circuit. Thus the energy of the point is potential, and it too waiting to be ‘connected’.</p>\n<p>Let us for a moment look at everything from this point of view. We can think of everything as consisting of points, but it is the middle point, the point of origin that we could look at, and reduce an event to a ‘point’. So, in order to be connected, and thus flow, the point needs to recognise or acknowledge some other point. Think of it like a goal. One has to have somewhere one desires to go, in order to move. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/go.html\">lech lecha</a> [However, in Abram’s case, before he had been given the place to go, he was told by G-d to “<em>lech lecha</em>”.] It is like imagining some other point, and then heading in that direction. In a sense you could say that you created a line of energy between your present point, and some future point. The line that emerges to connect the two points is two dimensional, or binary. It is referred to as the relationship between the two points. I like to think of it as a vector, which is a line that has direction, though that direction is limited to 2d.</p>\n<p>Now these two points could replicate or connect to many other points, creating patterns and object of immense complexity and beauty, but it would still only be in 2d. How then, does it manifest in 3d, I ask. Is it just a miracle, or magic, evolution or chance? It is, indeed a mystery.</p>\n<p>On one hand, in order for a 3d point to be expressed, there has to have already existed the 3d space. Which makes complete sense. If the Void emanated in all directions simultaneously, there has to be it has to have an infinite amount of dimensions. Now perhaps to manifest this existence in which we all find ourselves, it may have only required 10 or 11 dimensions, and so the rest are irrelevant to us, but they still exist in the ‘mind of God’, or, as we use in our modern and much more ascetic language, as ‘potential.</p>\n<p>But whereas 2d can easily be expressed in terms of length and breadth, there is something impetus that enabled these point to plumb the depths of their existence, and discover 3d. It is similar to, in the history of art, most ancient paintings had a 2d, or flat, perspective.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-veil-again\" tabindex=\"-1\">The veil again <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/#the-veil-again\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A mysterious veil exists between the finite and infinite. Another exists between between 1 and 0. It is incomprehensible how the infinite “becomes” finite, even greater than the mystery of how the finite can comprehend the infinite. My experience of life is finite – it has a beginning and an end – and that is a fact we all live with. Everything around me is finite Thus I have a clear and fundamental idea of what is finite. However, as a finite being, I can only approach infinity, never quite reaching it. So the deep existentialist question remains: how can the finite comprehend the infinite? This mystery is called the Pakod, the curtain or veil. It is like a mist we cannot pass through – only imagine. As much as I extend myself, I can never “become” infinite.</p>\n<p>Thus I come to the conclusion, that unless the finite has risen out of the infinite it could never “return” to it. In fact, only from the infinite could the finite have come, for only the infinite has no source, no beginning and no end. But how? In the upper view, there is no finite, only the Infinite. In the finite materialistic view/comprehension, the infinite is a collection of finite objects – quanta, particles of matter. Somehow, we have a deep belief that because we are created from the universe, we might be able to understand it! But how can the finite mind understand an infinite cause? We can only track and learn from Its behaviour, Its reactions, Its “communication”. What is communication? It is the transfer of information. Thus the Infinite communicates to us finite beings through the finite things of this world. And it for us to listen to Its guidance.</p>\n<p>Everything thus leads to G!d.</p>\n<p>It turns out, once again, paradoxically, that the only possible meeting place of the finite and infinite is 0, zero, nothing, the null set, the point of origin. By removing all the extraneous effects, all the coverings, letting go of self and ego and becoming like a hollow bone, I can return to my point of origin, and in a state of Nothing attain an experience of the Infinite. As has been mentioned before, I can try and expand to embrace the infinite, or fill myself up with everything I can, and never reach the end, the fulfilment – the desire, the drive to reach the goal, the end, will only become more extreme, and soul-destroying, as your being become more and more covered in material.</p>\n<p>Only way to expand beyond your finite constraint, and experience the Infinite, is to encounter the Zero point, the point of simultaneity, where through annihilation you touch the Infinite pluroma. Death is the only doorway to life – not physical death! The alternative is to try and become infinite. But no part of the finite can ever contain the infinite, even if it believes it can. The only infinite is infinite desire – which means that it is a desire that can never be assuaged – and that is where this desire ends up, in an infinite loop – and, all our energy is devoted to the fulfilment (i.e practise) of that desire.</p>\n<p>That is the discipline: Turning inward, through restraint. Impulse from below ... your impulse!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Beginning</p>\n<p>In the beginning, there was .... a becoming?</p>\n<p>Darn! I'm already confused.</p>\n<p>Let's try from another point. Before the beginning... there was.... nothing?</p>\n<p>That makes no sense! Because how can there be a &quot;before&quot; when we are speak of existence itself. I mean, what existed before everything existed?</p>\n<p>Ok, if you want to be really pedantic, you could claim that non-existence - a different kind of existence? - non-existed before existence. Does it now not exist anymore? Which brings in a very good question, the question of what does not exist because we of this existence?</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, to continue, it seems that, as far as we can cognite, our very existence &quot;begins&quot; at a certain point, just as we hypothesis for the &quot;birth of the universe&quot;, the Big Bang! Intrinsic in this view is a reflection of our own finite existence. We cannot really comprehend the concept of an endless universe - that is too grand for our finite minds. So, in order to speak of such things, we have to have a beginning <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/time.html\">Time Bound</a>, a &quot;point&quot; at which the story of our existence begins - which is referred to as <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/\">&quot;In the beginning&quot;</a> <em>bereishit</em> בראשִׁת. &quot;In the beginning arose a single point&quot;, a singularity represented by &quot;in&quot;, the moment it all began.</p>\n<p>Why is this point so important? Because it speaks of an <strong>imperfection</strong>, or apparent <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/perfect.html\">imperfection in the Perfection</a> that existed before. Like the tiniest stain on an otherwise white cloth.</p>\n<p>Now let us speak of &quot;before&quot;.</p>\n<p>'Long, long time ago, before time, and thus before before, in a place of absolutes - perfect silence, total peace, continuous perfection, absolute and complete ... nothing, no words, no actions, no sound - nothing could express this... no words, sounds thoughts or ideas (and that is why we call it <em>Nothing</em>).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"analysis-of-&quot;in-the-beginning&quot;\" tabindex=\"-1\">Analysis of &quot;in the beginning&quot; <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/beginning/#analysis-of-%22in-the-beginning%22\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In the beginning\n<ul>\n<li>This phrase represents &quot;the beginning&quot;, the &quot;start&quot;, the &quot;first...&quot;.</li>\n<li>Different from &quot;from the beginning&quot;</li>\n<li>In/from:\n<ul>\n<li>In:\n<ul>\n<li>speaks of a position, a point/place in time. &quot;In the beginning&quot;</li>\n<li>Represents a dynamic, circular motion, or angular momentum.\n<ul>\n<li>If &quot;beginning&quot; represents a point in time, what does &quot;in&quot; represent in this case?\n<ul>\n<li>This is where the language begins to play a part.</li>\n<li><em>bereishit</em> means also &quot;first&quot;, so it could be translated as &quot;first G-d created...&quot;.

We live in a world that is defined by three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. Objects move within this domain in two ways. An object <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/co-ords/displacement.html\">translates</a>, or changes <strong>location</strong>, from one point to another. And an object <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/co-ords/torque.html\">rotates</a>, or changes its <strong>orientation</strong>. In general, the motion of an object involves both translations in all three directions and rotation about [three principle axes]. On this page we are going to simplify the discussion and neglect changes in time and one of the spatial dimensions. So we will only consider motion in a two-dimensional plane. At the bottom of the page we include some comments about extending these ideas to three dimensions.</p>\n<p>To describe the motion of an object, we need to locate the object relative to some reference location. We will call the reference location the <strong>origin</strong>. We need two pieces of information to describe the location because the plane is two dimensional. There are many ways to specify the location of a point $p$ relative to the origin. We will discuss two ways of making the determination.</p>\n<p>One way to specify the location of point $p$ is to define two perpendicular coordinate axes through the origin. Each axis is a number line, with a length increment selected along the line. On the figure, we have labelled these axes X and Y and the resulting coordinate system is called a <strong>rectangular</strong> or <strong>Cartesian</strong> coordinate system. To determine the location of point $p$ we measure out from the $Y$ axis, parallel to the $X$ axis, to obtain a distance $Xp$. And then we measure up from the $X$ axis, parallel to the $Y$ axis to obtain $Yp$. The pair of coordinates $(Xp$, $Yp)$ describe the location of point $p$ relative to the origin. The system is called <strong>rectangular</strong> because the angle formed by the axes at the origin is 90 degrees and the angle formed by the measurements at point $p$ is also 90 degrees. So the measurement forms a rectangle with sides $Xp$ and $Yp$. The system is called <strong>Cartesian</strong> because it was extensively used by the French mathematican Rene Descartes.</p>\n<p>Another way to specify the location of point $p$ would be to directly measure the distance $r$ between the origin and point $p$. But we need another piece of information. There are an infinite number of points that are a distance $r$ away from the origin. They form a circle around the origin with radius $r$. To specify the location of point $p$, we can pick a reference line that goes through the origin and measure the angle $theta$ formed by the reference line and a line going through point $p$. On the figure, we have made the reference line lie right along the Cartesian $X$ axis. The coordinate pair $(r, \\theta)$ uniquely describe the location of point $p$. This set of coordinates is called a <strong>polar</strong> coordinate system. You will notice on the figure that the angular measurement $\\theta$ crosses the radial measurement $r$ by forming a 90 degree angle at point $p$. So a polar coordinate system is said to be an <strong>orthogonal</strong> coordinate system, just like the rectangular system.</p>\n<p>The location of point $p$ relative to the origin is the same in any coordinate system. We just describe that location differently depending on the coordinate system we use. For the two orthogonal coordinate systems that we are considering, we can define functions that let us switch between the two descriptions. If we have determined the location of point p by the polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$, we can find the rectangular coordinates $(Xp, Yp)$ by these equations:</p>\n<p>$Xp = r cos(\\theta)$<br />\n$Yp = r sin(\\theta)$</p>\n<p>Likewise, if we know the rectangular coordinates, we can determine the polar coordinates by these equations:</p>\n<p>$r = \\sqrt (Xp^2 + Yp^2)$</p>\n<p>$\\theta = tan^-1 (Yp / Xp)$<br />\nwhere function $tan^-1$ is the inverse tangent or <strong>arc tangent</strong> function.</p>\n<p>On this slide, for simplicity, we have developed the coordinate equations in only two dimensions which requires two coordinate axes. For aircraft and rocket motion, there are three spatial dimensions and therefore three coordinates required. For rectangular coordinates, we can simply add a third axis $Z$ that is perpendicular to both $X$ and $Y$. This addition produces a <strong>rectangular</strong> Cartesian coordinate system consisting of $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. For polar coordinates, there are several different possibilities for describing the third dimension. We could add another axis $Z$ that is perpendicular to the plane formed by $r$ and $\\theta$. This addition produces a cylindrical coordinate system consisting of $r$, $Z$ and $\\theta$. Or we could specify another angle $\\phi$ that is perpendicular to the radius $r$ and the angle $\\theta$. This addition produces a <strong>spherical</strong> coordinate system consisting of $r$, $theta$ and $phi$. There are conversion equations that let you switch between any of these coordinate systems.</p>\n<p>There is a whole branch of mathematics called <strong>tensor analysis</strong> that deals with the subject of coordinate systems and how to convert between various coordinate systems. This subject becomes very important when we get into the details of calculus and how the values of variables change within a given coordinate system. The choice of coordinate system is often dictated by the geometry of a particular problem. For example, the surface of a tube is more easily described by a cylindrical coordinate system than by a spherical or rectangular coordinate system. It can be done with any three dimensional coordinate system, but the geometry favors the cylindrical in this case.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\" tabindex=\"-1\">References <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/co-ords/#references\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system\">Polar Coordinate System</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system\">Rectangular Coordinate System</a></li>\n</ol>\n",

And the only way we could be remembered is by what we left behind. What monuments you built, or discoveries you stumbled upon - something that you would be recorded in the history of the victors. It is the most horrifying thought for a living being - one who is aware of his impending death. It is a cross which is uniquely human. No other animal seems to bear it as heavily as do we. Nevertheless, that looming abyss of death is a terrifying thought, and we will do anything to avoid it - even kill another. [An eye for an eye will produce a kingdom ruled by one-eyed men and women] Thus our &quot;health&quot; industry spent billions on keeping people alive! Helping sick people live healthy lives requires sick people. You product is health, but your inventory is sick people. If the majority of people were healthy, the &quot;health&quot; industry would fail!</p>\n<p>So let's gather under the banner of life. Let's build a nation of people who live healthy lives. Let's provide one another with living food and clean living water first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"decentralised-system\" tabindex=\"-1\">Decentralised system <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/#decentralised-system\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It aims for a decentralised system that actively focuses on NOT preventing the less-fortunate people's access to the resources that they need to live decent lives. To have support and encouragement would be superb. However, I think the need for control is what requires those in power to strictly regulate ALL access to resources - ultimate power being the control of all access to every resource The network solution to that is, being powered by and from community groups their communal needs, not by obeying the commands of a centralised system with an overarching authority – which is the kind of hierarchical control systems we have at present.</p>\n<h2 id=\"energy-as-currency\" tabindex=\"-1\">Energy as Currency <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/#energy-as-currency\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>They are welcome to participate in our exchange system as well. It is based purely on energy exchange. It has two forms. The first is that of &quot;energy at rest&quot;, and it has a certain &quot;measure&quot;. The other is &quot;energy at work&quot; or force and it has a similar measure. Though these can be described with a number of other comparative variables as well - which we will not go into yet.

This flow has to be to achieve better relationship with this background upon which we dance. It is like not listening to the music, when dancing a duet.</p>\n<p>[Somewhere there was a period where that was being expressed to the general benefit of the general population. And we were prepared to pay the price to achieve that material success and relative ease. Now the success of those ventures, is threatening our very existence. Probably because we are not willing to pay the price to maintain these benefits.]</p>\n<h2 id=\"freedom\" tabindex=\"-1\">Freedom <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/#freedom\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Freedom from... what?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Freedom from oppression</li>\n<li>Freedom from bondage</li>\n<li>Freedom from tyrants</li>\n<li>Freedom from liars</li>\n<li>Freedom from psychopathic leadership</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Freedom for... what?<br />\nMost of the time, we want freedom to do, or explore, the things we are not allowed or permitted to explore. The great adventure is escaping from your confinement and venturing out into the wilderness to experience something greater.<br />\nAnd there are those of us who are terrified of what lurks in the darkness beyond which we can see.<br />\nA balance between both is what we seek.</p>\n<p>Again, I ask, Freedom for... what?<br />\nOften we escape from one bondage, only to find ourselves caged in another. Can we ever escape that bondage, even if it is only to our own petty or grandiose desires?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Egotism: The lowest form of freedom, is freedom to do what I want. To have what I want. Completely ego driven is very attractive to many who doubt their own worth, but is in the end so lonely, that it drives many to madness or to suicide. For, if successful, their whole existence will eventually consist only of reflections of their own egos - nothing else will be able to live in their space, and its surrounds. If unsuccessful, they will be absorbed into their own fantasies, and could sink into some deep dark place, from which any weird energy could explode.</li>\n<li>Altruism: The next, normal humane level is that of service to an-other, or in a more developed form, others. Pure altruism, to dedicate oneself totally to the needs of other, is noble, but can be draining on the soul. There must be something left for yourself, otherwise you will dissolve in the ocean of needy. Take care, that it does not become a need, and thus essentially ego-feeding, instead of ego-reducing.</li>\n<li>Seers: The we have the madmen and women who are driven by some vision that they see, or hear, or feel. They are a mixture of pure egotist, and yet often they are not driven by the gains of what they seek.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"light-and-dark\" tabindex=\"-1\">Light &amp; Dark <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/#light-and-dark\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We cannot lesson the dark by focusing on it.

In nature, where is there &quot;noise&quot;? It is the sound of the tree falling - not its noise. It is the sound of children playing, not the noise of their playing.</p>\n<p>If we go a little deeper, all the sounds of nature carry information, loads of it. The chirping of the birds tell us that the rain has ended. The barking of the dogs tells us that someone is around. Sounds we listen to and for.</p>\n<p>Noise on the other hand penetrates our space, and speaks of something that is out-of-bounds, often violent. The noise of a crashing vase, the noise of the neighbour's car starting, the noise of two people arguing. Noises hit our adrenals, putting us in a flight or fight mode.</p>\n<p>The background of nature is often silence, although I have been in forests that are filled with cacophonies of sound. It is generally a healthy forest that manifests that array of sound - unless it the cry of a forest and its inhabitants being stressed by some invasion.</p>\n<p>It is a background upon which you learn to hear and listen. To receive the sounds and place them in the natural narrative. It is like a conversation with the living beings that surround us.</p>\n<p>However, in the urban - could I say human, and thus non-natural - environments, the background consists of lots of noise. So much so that we become so habituated to it that we crave it. We frequent places like bars and restaurants in which we can be surrounded by the familiar background hubbub of voices, in quiet places like malls and stores, there will be no silence, but will often have piped music that allows that part - let us call it the &quot;audio&quot; part - of our minds no rest.</p>\n<p>Thus most of what we are hearing in the cities are sounds that we are irrelevant to us, and we ignore. There are other's that we might even reject - or walk away from. But the default response is &quot;throw-away&quot;. In other words, there is more noise on the line(s) in the city, than useful or nourishing sounds.</p>\n<p>It is like a post-office that receives mostly junk mail, or like the junk email that constitutes that majority of our email - you just don't see most of it. In other words, most of what is being received has to be rejected! Just like the sounds of the city.</p>\n<p>In nature, however, we can sit and open our ears, both our outer and inner, and listen. It requires a certain silence and inner peace, and slowly she will awaken and you will become more and more aware of the sounds and movements all around.</p>\n<p>So we invite you to spend some time in nature and just listen, to yourself, to your thoughts and begin to feel all the living beings and energies that exist in this space, and how they speak to you and for you. It is as if you are surrounded in love - soft, gentle, quiet love, where the lullabies and love-songs are sung in soft and hesitant melodies.</p>\n",

Here are the seven kinds of love according to the ancient Greeks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eros:-love-of-the-body\" tabindex=\"-1\">Eros: Love of the body <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love_greek/#eros:-love-of-the-body\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eros: sexual, erotic<br />\ndefinition: love based on physical appearance<br />\nwhen you eros-love someone, you give to receive, and don’t receive. this type of love is much like lust but lust is not a type of love, it is an infatuation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Eros was the Greek God of love and sexual desire. He was shooting golden arrows into the hearts of both mortals and immortals without warning. The Greeks feared that kind of love the most because it was dangerous and could get them into the most trouble. Eros is defined as divine beauty or lust. Eros is mainly based on sexual attraction and it is where the term “erotica” came from.</p>\n<p>Example of Eros love: A young couple that meets and immediately feels attracted, and lustful, towards one another.</p>\n<h3 id=\"philia:-love-of-the-mind\" tabindex=\"-1\">Philia: Love of the mind <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love_greek/#philia:-love-of-the-mind\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Philia or Phileo: friendship, “brotherly love”<br />\ndefinition: love based on common interests or bonds<br />\nwhen you phileo-love someone, its a relationship where you give to receive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also know as brotherly love, Philia represents the sincere and platonic love. The kind of love you have for your brother or a really good friend. It was more valuable and more cherished than Eros. Philia exists when people share the same values and dispositions with someone and the feelings are reciprocated.</p>\n<p>Example of Philia love: Two friends talk about how deeply they understand each other, and how that security and openness causes them to feel comfortable and taken care of.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ludus:-playful-love\" tabindex=\"-1\">Ludus: Playful love <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love_greek/#ludus:-playful-love\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ludus: flirtatious, playful, casual, uncommitted</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ludus is the flirtatious and teasing kind of love, the love mostly accompanied by dancing or laughter. It’s the child-like and fun kind of love. If you think about it; this generation loves Ludus more than anything else.</p>\n<p>Example of Ludus love: Modern love at its finest, Ludus love is best described by thinking of two people who just want to have fun together, with little need for security or roots.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pragma:-longstanding-love\" tabindex=\"-1\">Pragma: Longstanding love <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love_greek/#pragma:-longstanding-love\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pragma: committed, long-standing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The everlasting love between a married couple which develops over a long period of time. Pragma was the highest form of love; the true commitment that comes from understanding, compromise and tolerance. It is pragmatic this is why it is referred to as “standing in love” rather than “falling in love” because it grows over time and requires profound understanding between lovers who have been together for many years.</p>\n<p>Example of Pragma love: Think about your grandparents, and how they have endured so much, but have always chosen each other.</p>\n<h3 id=\"agape:-love-of-the-soul\" tabindex=\"-1\">Agape: Love of the soul <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love_greek/#agape:-love-of-the-soul\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Agape: “unconditional love”, divine, selfless<br />\ndefinition- literally translated means ‘charity’. loving someone/something on no conditions (no matter what)<br />\nwhen you agape-love, you give for the sake of making the other person happy. because you truly want the best for them. you have no intentions of receiving.<br />\nThe final result of the natural chemical blending of unrelated feelings that one holds toward another, which, once synthesized, create an emotion that is independent of the confines of time or the elements of this existence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Agape love is selfless love, the love for humanity. It is the closest to unconditional love. The love you give without expecting anything in return reflected in all charitable acts. It is the compassionate love that makes us sympathize with, help and connect to people we don’t know. The world needs more Agape love.</p>\n<p>Example of Agape love: The person in your life that is always giving to others, and needing nothing in return. This is the way they show their love, and this is the way they are energized through love. By giving all that they have, and all that they are, to those around them, they find beauty in life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"philautia:-love-of-the-self\" tabindex=\"-1\">Philautia: Love of the self <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love_greek/#philautia:-love-of-the-self\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Philautia: self-love</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ancient Greeks divided Philautia into two kinds: There is one that is pure selfish and seeks pleasure, fame, and wealth often leading to narcissism and there is another healthy kind of love we give ourselves. Philautia is essential for any relationship, we can only love others if we truly love ourselves and we can only care for others if we truly care for ourselves.</p>\n<p>Example of Philautia love: Selfish Philautia love is the kind of love that takes and does not give back in return — this is someone who only uses others to excel in life. Think about the social climbers of the world. On the other hand, the positive kind of Philautia can be seen in a couple that is a union, not a melting pot. They both do their own things, but they come together and support each others own growth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"storge:-love-of-the-child\" tabindex=\"-1\">Storge: Love of the child <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love_greek/#storge:-love-of-the-child\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Storge: affection</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Storge is the love parents naturally feel for their children. It’s based on natural feelings and effortless love. Storge is the love that knows forgiveness, acceptance and sacrifice. It is the one that makes you feel secure, comfortable and safe.</p>\n<p>Example of Storge love: Think about the kind of love your mother gives you, or your very best friend. It is rooted in friendship, and understanding, but there is also a deep emotional connection there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mania:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mania: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/love_greek/#mania:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mania: obsessive, possessive, addictive, dependent</li>\n</ul>\n",

Rabbi Simeon began by quoting: “In Salem is His tabernacle...” (Ps. 76:3). Come and see.

It darkened and then was kindled. He brought out from the recesses a single drop, and He joined them together, with them, He created the world. The flame ascended and was crowned on the left, and the drop ascended and was crowned on the right, They encountered one another and changed places, one on one side, and one on the other. The one that descended went up, and the one that ascended went down. They became intertwined, and a perfect spirit emerged from them. The two sides were immediately made one, and it was placed between them, and they were crowned with each other. Then there was peace above and peace below, and the level was established. He was crowned with vav, and vav with he, and he ascended and was joined with perfect bond.

Infinite points spreading out equally from the middle point. It was once thought the there were areas where the universe was being created, and others were it was being destroyed, constantly. There is a cosmological explanation from science that speaks of the hyper-inflationary universe. This universe emerges (is emerging?) in the same fashion.</p>\n<p>However that may be, it is certain that there was not a single event.</p>\n<p>Another way to think of this, is that until there are more than one event, and these events interact in some form or fashion, there is nothing that can happen. Thus although there might be information contained in this single event, unless there is another event interacting with it, this event will have absolutely no effect on anything, except itself! <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/ohr_ein_sof/narcissism.html\">narcissism</a></p>\n<p>{NOTE: Thus we have 3 identifiable things - 2 events &amp; some sort of interaction between the two. Then that interaction can affect one (or both) of these events. We could say we have two points and a line between them. That &quot;line&quot;, if itself represented as a point (of notice), a triangle (or triplet) would be a clearer symbol to represent that situation with. However, one could say that that triangle needs to be situated in a space that is not quite this space. It extends along a different dimension or axis as is more commonly known. If another event emerged out of two, or more,connected, or more events, would we then have a triangle emerging.}</p>\n<h2 id=\"ohr-ein-sof\" tabindex=\"-1\">Ohr Ein Sof <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/ohr_ein_sof/#ohr-ein-sof\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Filled entire reality</li>\n<li>No vacant place (empty Air or Space)</li>\n<li>Everything filled with an <strong>Upper Simple Light</strong></li>\n<li>Boundless</li>\n<li>All was One</li>\n<li>Perfect &amp; balanced</li>\n<li>No beg. nor end<br />\n→ restricts itself =&gt; <strong>First Constraint</strong><br />\n→ emanations &amp; creatures<br />\n→ reason: revelation of Its Names &amp; Appellations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Anything we do not attain, we do not know the name of!</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"upper-simple-light\" tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Upper Simple Light</strong> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/ohr_ein_sof/#upper-simple-light\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Light that expands from the <em>Atzmut</em> – Vitality, strength, power, force, of the Creator.<br />\nNote: Does not refer to actual <em>Atzmut</em>, but only the Light that expands from the <em>Atzmut</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“<strong>Upper Light</strong> filled the entire reality”<br />\n→ the entire reality relating to their existence in the void.<br />\n→ the <strong>Upper Light</strong> filled them (<strong>souls &amp; worlds</strong>) entirely</p>\n<ul>\n<li>→ no vacant place<br />\nA place that would not qualify for correction Because the Supernal Light (<strong>Ohr Elyon</strong>) filled that place completely No room for the <em>Tachtonim</em>, or lower beings.</li>\n<li>Before the worlds were created there was only Void<br />\n→ where correction &amp; perfection could be added</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"worlds-and-souls:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Worlds &amp; Souls: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/ohr_ein_sof/#worlds-and-souls:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<pre><code>  All the worlds &amp; souls\n    That exist\n    And are destined to be created\n      With all their incidents\n      Until the end of their correction.\n    Are included in the Void (Ein Sof)\nand existed before creation that the Upper Light could fill.\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Fixed &amp; Exist in the Void/Presence/Ein Sof in all their measure and glory.</li>\n<li>How they are arranged/hang down/innovate</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After the <strong>First Constraint</strong> in the five worlds:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>World</th>\n<th>Soul</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Divine Template</td>\n<td><em>Adam Kadmon</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emanation</td>\n<td><em>Atzilut</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Creation</td>\n<td><em>Beria</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Foundation</td>\n<td><em>Yetzira</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Action/</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The manifest realm/Kingdom of Heaven</td>\n<td><em>Assiya</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"spiritual-light\" tabindex=\"-1\">אור Spiritual Light <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/ohr_ein_sof/#spiritual-light\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Empty Air</strong> (<strong>אויר ריקני</strong>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not corporeal air, but spiritual light, <strong>Ohr</strong>.<br />\nEvery <strong>Partzuf</strong> – Expression or face<br />\n2 aspects:</li>\n<li><strong>Ohr de Hochmah</strong> (Wisdom) - Vitality</li>\n<li><strong>Ohr de Chassidim</strong> (Mercy) - clothing<br />\n<em>[Y”mba: So the light is no longer Simple]</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>First Constraint</strong> (Constraint of the Light):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Occurred around <strong>middle point</strong></li>\n<li>Space that emanated was a <strong>circle</strong> (meaning perfect &amp; balanced)</li>\n<li>Introduced a wanting and a vacant place for the <strong>corrections</strong><br />\n(Not speaking of a corporeal place)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"invitation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Invitation <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/ohr_ein_sof/#invitation\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is an invitation to take a walk with me into one of the hallowed pathways of ancient wisdom. Remember that these wisdom texts do not speak of a world that is subject to change, a world that takes up time or space (as we know it), but another world, the <em>Olam Ha’ba</em>, the World to Come, a “spiritual” realm. I hesitate to call it a “realm”, as it is not another place, but one that already exists, waiting for us to claim it and thus change the world we now live in – the World to Come!</p>\n<p>It is difficult for those unfamiliar with this territory, as they perceive matters by means of corporeal boundaries of time and space, change and exchange, cause and effect. However, in this text, the authors only use these concepts as signs (or symbols) to point to their “Upper Roots”, their higher spiritual manifestation.</p>\n<p>“Higher” here only meaning “closer to the Source”. It could also mean “higher”, or more subtle, vibrations or frequency – pointing out that higher and lower are in relation to an agreed upon measurement. Whereas in the spiritual sense, higher would mean closer to the Truth – and that would translate to mean having more information (and intelligence to receive this information) regarding the real nature of existence and life.</p>\n<p>This then is my attempt to render what has been spoken in a different language, at a different time, and in a different cultural milieu into this time and with the concepts and symbols that we have available at this present time – many of which have been carried from the shoulders of our ancestors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references-not-real\" tabindex=\"-1\">References, not real <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/ohr_ein_sof/#references-not-real\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Before we begin, it is important to underline the fact that all of this is based on spiritual matters that do not take up space and time. Bear in mind, that the entire wisdom of Kabbalah is founded on spiritual matters that do not take up time or space. They are not subject to change or absence and all the changes that are spoken of in this wisdom do not imply that the first form becomes absent and is replaced by a different form. The above change rather implies an additional form, while the first does not move from its place, as absence and change are corporeal conducts.</p>\n<p>For that reason I will make an effort to give every word its spiritual identity, detached of space, time and change. It is upon the readers to memorize the meaning of these words thoroughly, for it is impossible to repeat them every time.</p>\n<p>We begin with the <strong>Tzimtzum Aleph</strong>, the First Constraint, which occurred when the Infinite Supernal Presence restricted itself in order to enable the Emanation and thus create creation. Now, before this occurred, there only existed the Void, <em>Ein Sof</em>, which filled everything, everywhere, all the time. That was all there was. This creation/constraint occurred around a single point, which we call the middle point, producing a space that emanated after that was circular, because <em>Ohr Ein Sof</em>, the Infinite Presence, is perfect and balanced, thus the Constraint was also even. This is meaning of <strong>Agol</strong>, the Circle.</p>\n<p>In all of this resides a mystery for it says that the reason for all of this, for all of creation, was “the revelation of Its Names and Appellations!&quot; Why would It need us to “reveal” Its names and appelations? What does it really mean, for the Upper Simple Light to “reveal”? Is it by us “revealing” Its names, It is revealed? Is it like a marriage? As you spend more time together, you understand the other, and thus your spouse is “revealed” in the same way?</p>\n<pre><code>1. Know, that before the Emanations were emanated and the Creations created, an Upper Simple Light[^1] had filled the entire reality.[^2] There was no vacant place,[^3] such as empty Air[^4] or a Space,[^5] but everything was filled with that simple, boundless Presence of Light.[^6] There was no idea of the Beginning nor of the End.[^7] All was One, Simple Light,[^8] completely balanced,[^9] called the Infinite Light, _Ohr Ein Sof_. [^10]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we are describing in more detail what actually occurred at this momentous event, the one we might today know as the Big Bang Theory of Creation. It begins by emphasizing the fact that before anything emanated, or was created, there was only the Upper Simple Light, אור עליון פשוט, which filled everything, leaving no space vacant. This light expanded from the Vitality (strength, force, power) of the Creator.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let me remind you that all the names and appellations used in the wisdom of the Kabbalah are never referring to the Vitality of the Creator but only to the Light that expands (or emanates) from Its Vitality. We are unable to utter a single word regarding Its Power, for the rule is that anything we do not attain, we do not know its name. Remember that and you will not fail!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"footnotes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Footnotes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/ohr_ein_sof/#footnotes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are two rudiments concerning these Worlds and Souls, we should discern in reality before us:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They are fixed and exist in the Presence, Ein Sof, in all their measure and their glory.</li>\n<li>How they are arranged and hang down and innovate before us after the First Constraint, <strong>Tzimtzum Aleph</strong>, in the five Worlds: the Divine Template, Emanation, Creation, Foundation and Action - the Manifest Realm, Kingdom of Heaven – <em>Adam Kadmon</em>, <em>Atzilut</em>, <em>Beria</em>, <em>Yetzira</em> and <em>Assiya</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Upper Light that extends from His Will, also known as his Vigour, or Power - <em>Atzmut</em> - “had filled the entire reality.” This refers to the entire reality relating to their existence in the Void, Ein Sof, before the Constraint occurred. The Upper Light filled them entirely, until they had no vacant place left where correction and perfection could be added whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Because of the <strong>Tzimtzum</strong> there came about a wanting and a vacant place for the corrections. However, do not be mistaken to think that this book speaks of a corporeal place.</p>\n<p>The Light of Wisdom is the expression of the vitality of the Face. The Light of Mercy only operates as a clothing or veiling over this Light, since the Light of Wisdom cannot permeate the <em>Partzuf</em> if it does not wear the Light of Mercy first.</p>\n<p>However, sometimes, when this Face is constricted, it only has <em>Ohr de Hassadim</em>. You should know that that the Light of Mercy is called Air, or sometimes Wind – <em>Avir</em>, or <em>Ruach</em>. When it is by itself, without the Light of Wisdom, it is called “empty Air”. Then it waits for the Light of Wisdom to fulfil it.</p>\n<p>Before the Worlds were created such empty Air did not exist in reality at all, because there was not any earth there.</p>\n<p>Know, that the amount of that Desire and yearning is the entire substance that exists in the <em>Ne’etzal</em>. Thus, everything that exists in the <em>Ne’etzal</em> that is not that substance, no longer relates to its substance, but to the Abundance that it receives from the <em>Ma'atzil</em>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this substance determines the Importance, <em>Gadlut</em> [greatness, eminence, importance], and the level of each <em>Ne’etzal</em>, each <em>Partzuf</em>, and each <em>sefirah</em>. The Dissemination of the Supernal Light from the <em>Ma'atzil</em> is certainly immeasurable, but it is the <em>Ne’etzal</em> that limits the Flow, for it receives no more and no less than its measure of desire to receive. This is the criterion in spirituality, because there is no coercion there; it depends entirely on the Desire to Receive..</p>\n<p>For that reason we call this will to receive the “Vessel of Reception” of the <em>Ne’etzal</em>. It is regarded as its substance and the reason that it stopped being regarded as a <em>Ma'atzil</em> and was denominated as a Ne’etzal. The Ne’etzal is defined by a substance that does not exist in the Ma'atzil whatsoever, for there is absolutely no will to receive in the Ma'atzil.</p>\n<p>There are four degrees in this substance, from Smallness, <em>Katnut</em> [smallness, insignificance] to Greatness, <em>Gadlut</em> of reception. The fourth degree, being the Greatness of the reception, is complete only in the Void, <em>Ein Sof</em>, before the Worlds were created. It is the only one that was subject to the Constraint, <em>Tzimtzum</em>, and we will clarify henceforth that it was emptied of every Flow that it had from the Void, <em>Ein Sof</em>, and remained a vacant Space. This is what the Sage means when he says that before the World was created this vacant Space did not exist.</p>\n",

We can't put our finger on what it is, but we know it exists by its ability to &quot;know&quot; certain things. Simply, like how to do something - that is knowledge. Knowledge, except for the gifted, needs to be gained and trained. It is achieved by combining experience and learning.</p>\n<p>Intention is from another realm. It cannot be &quot;attained&quot;, though it too is only known by its outward expression - and will, of course, be tempered by what the individual (or object) &quot;knows&quot;.</p>\n<p>However, (conscious) intention is static! It requires the flow to stop - even if only to &quot;realise&quot; the intention.</p>\n<p>If intention remains unconscious, then though it is not in the realm of the truly involuntary, but it is now entering into the dissonant realm, existing in an in-between place, a kind of limbo, in that it has a conscious aspect, though the consciousness that is &quot;conscious&quot; cannot understand the symbols and method by which this half-consciousness is attempting to communicate (and, generally, asking for help [unless evil]).</p>\n<p>That is essentially the place where the shaman works. All he or she does is return with these &quot;pieces&quot; of information - a kind of a messenger, a human <em>Malach</em>, or angel. If this shaman is working with God, Great Spirit, <em>Ruach Ha'Kadosh</em>, then it will be up to the person to receive these &quot;spirit&quot; gifts, and by a wonderful magical process of synthesia or some form of strange empathy, fit it into their soul mapping.

We have all gladly or begrudgingly or by force participated in the creation of this form of society, with its benefits and lacks. However, at this point, the game has been so skewed to those that have money and resources, that for most others, it is useless even running – almost like a lottery. There are many who believe in it, and many who put money and energy into it, but very few who reap the benefits amongst the millions who play. So it is with this present neo-liberal capitalism. Slowly more and more people will drop out of the running, until it will become an almost incestuous, but definitely nepotistic, game played amongst those wealthy enough to be able to participate in the game. The rest, it will be drudge, and labour and miserable conditions in which they will live.</p>\n<p>The secret of this control is to ensure that those that do drop out do not have enough resources to be able to erect and maintain a different system, perhaps a different way of doing things. In the past, people opted out literally by simply packing and leaving. Up until recently there always seemed to be somewhere to be able to escape to. . . physically anyway.</p>\n<p>Nowadays we have a different situation. The only space we have left in within the society that we live, and thus whatever arises will have to arise as a cancer or an illness to the body, and thus, hopefully the body society will arise changed by the experience, or otherwise, continue the same patterns, till the next attempt.</p>\n",

In the first part I will explain what I understood from our conversations, and the second part is how I would present it in a short description for the website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-one:-my-understanding.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Part one: My understanding. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama_in_hogsback/#part-one:-my-understanding.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kabbalah is a science of the spirit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"5-souls\" tabindex=\"-1\">5 souls <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama_in_hogsback/#5-souls\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Kabbalah does not recognize the soul as a single entity, but rather separates the soul into 5 elements; <em>Nefesh</em>, <em>Ruach</em>, <em>Neshamah</em>, <em>Chayah</em>, and <em>Yechidah</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Nefesh</em> is our bodily soul, our vivifying soul. Vivified means ‘to bring to life’, so this is the part of our soul which which awakens at birth, upon inhabiting this body. It is that soul which is experiencing this physical existence, through its having become entangled in this physical representation, your bodies, Thus it becomes aware and reacts to the sensations of our physical body in the physical world. This soul, whose nomenclature also represents “rest”, is placed in surroundings that are known as the “Realm of Action/Doing” (<em>Assiyah</em>) It is represented in modern psychology as the ego, and it is what “holds” or “forms” us here. It is also a veil, (and a bridge) or barrier (with portals) between the conscious and “unconscious”, the “body” and the “soul”.</p>\n<p><em>Ruach</em>, the next level of our soul, means ‘spirit’. The manifestation of <em>Ruach</em> is in our <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama_in_hogsback/feelings.html\">feelings</a>{It is necessary to differentiate between feelings and emotions. Feelings as the sensations that your body is experiencing. Emotions as the &quot;feelings/thoughts&quot; that are manifest/experienced as an, almost cognitive - one could say imaginative/imaginary - response to the &quot;initial&quot; sensations.} This realm is also known as the realm of formation. Our feelings form us, not our emotions. In every aspect of this teaching (almost), there is an upper and a lower aspect. Think of it as the front and the back, or the above and the below. I stand between heaven above me and the earth below me. I am referring here to an earth that is as vast as the heavens. Like the firmament that separated the upper waters from the lower one. Thus emotion would be the lower aspect of this energy, and feelings the upper. Look at the word itself: emote &amp; e-motion, both referring to something that “comes out of”, “sticks out of”. If I emote – I express my anger, or pain, or sadness in an emotional, often dramatic sense. But when I have a feeling, of love, or compassion, it comes from something that is authentically mine. It is this feeling, this aspect of the energy, that will form the “things” of my life. For the truth of it is that it, this upper feeling, comes from above. And the training is to recognize that, discern that which comes from above and the which comes from below.</p>\n<p>This part of our soul has the awareness of emotion. More like, it is the expression of these feelings &amp; emotions. The “forms” that make up how we experience and what we do in our lives. This is the reactive part of our soul and our heart-space.One might see it as the heart-space (in modern parlance). But the heart-space in Kabbalah is contained in the body! The <em>sefirah</em> that represents it is called <em>Tipheret</em>, [I thought I had installed the Hebrew keyboard on this document editor, but have not, and do not want to get distracted by doing it, so I will continue, and later install Hebrew] and it is known as Beauty.</p>\n<p>One could also conceive of <em>Ruach</em> as between <em>Nefesh</em> &amp; <em>Neshama</em>, with <em>Ruach</em> being the lower, more dense expression of <em>Neshama</em>. Ruach has been described as the “wind upon which the light travels”</p>\n<p><em>Neshamah</em> is related to the intellect - which speaks of the realm of thought, and it is this realm that our &quot;conscious&quot; awareness of G-d arises. It is the thoughts from which we proceed. Upon meeting someone, the thoughts we think will make a huge difference to our future. Only later do we “feel” something – for the realm of <em>Ruach</em> is denser, and thus energy travels slower. Here is the true act of creation taking place, and it exists as an expression of the realm that is called <em>Beriah</em>, or <em>Creation/Creativity</em>. It is the place (source) from which our thoughts are manifest – that is become conscious. And everything of which we are aware has to have passed through this realm. <em>Neshamah</em> is the place where we feel the <em>Ruach</em> (wind) of of the Divine energy. The primary activity of <em>Neshamah</em> is to become wise, – and the only way to do this is to seek G-d (etc...). <em>Neshamah</em> is of the essential rather than the ephemeral, and as such is an expression of your soul purpose, or your soul desire, or your soul mate . For the true purpose of your soul, your sole purpose, can never change for the &quot;lifetime&quot; of the soul. I would say that a sign of a person who has reached this level of consciousness and operates from this part of the soul is when you see a person dedicated to understanding the Divine, and is shining in and with Divine light.</p>\n<p>It is understood that at any moment in creation G-d is breathing, if this ever stops, creation will disappear! <em>Neshamah</em> is the in-breath, <em>Ruach</em> is the exhalation, manifested as creation. We, as created beings, breath in the <em>Neshamah</em> of God, “Breath of God” or “Holy Spirit” and breathe out our own creations – through our lives.<br />\nPerhaps you could meditate on the Trinity here – as <em>Neshama</em> – the Holy Ghost, <em>Ruach</em> as God, the father, and <em>Nefesh</em>, as God made “flesh”. Which, as Jesus has said, is all of us: &quot;We are all children of God&quot;, he said. Each and everyone of us, is G-d in flesh...</p>\n<p>The fourth level, <em>Chayah</em> speaks of the Divine Will that causes creation to manifest. It can only be experienced, it cannot be described. It is like the electricity flowing down the wire. The fifth level is one in which the soul is deep into its soul journey, in a realm so far above our understanding that words are inadequate to express it. Our only hope is to listen to the reports of those who have “visited” this space and managed to connect with It clearly enough to return with a message. The questionable aspect of these records is the uncertainty of what effect the journey of return had upon the message, let alone the messenger.</p>\n<p>We speak of these 5 levels of soul in order for us to better understand and relate to the experience of the world around and in us. So, for practicality, we focus on the first 3 levels, which are the most pertinent to our present exploration, <em>Nefesh</em>, <em>Ruach</em> &amp; <em>Neshama</em>.</p>\n<p>These ‘elements’ are also levels of consciousness – this I can see. <em>Nefesh</em> consciousness people would operate from their base chakra mostly, <em>Ruach</em> consciousness people will operate from their emotions mostly, then there are those who are living in and seeking <em>Neshamah</em>, seeking to understand G-ds’ soul. This is good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"archetypes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Archetypes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama_in_hogsback/#archetypes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A caution here: Because we are speaking in archetypical language, be careful of latching on to a specific meaning. It is necessary to keep the broader area in view, because we are seeking wisdom – and that requires penetrating the essence – the Divine spark hidden in all manifest/material things. All archetypes are symbols of something far larger than the name itself.</p>\n<p>So to give you an example, I will fill out some of the “meanings” of these names.</p>\n<p><em>Nefesh</em>, from the realm of <em>Assiyah</em>, the realm of Doing, the manifest realm, also known as <em>Malkut</em>, the Kingdom, and thus know as the Kingdom of God – and we are His people. It contains the lower 6 sefirot/spheres of influence, or sapphires, in it – that make up the “body”.</p>\n<p><em>Ruach</em>, from the realm of <em>Yetzirah</em>, the realm of Formation, the angelic realm, the realm where we have embodied, but not yet manifest. It has just one <em>sefirah</em>, Binah, the Supernal Mother, <em>Ima</em>, known as understanding. It is where the One splinters into its many forms, one of which is your <em>Nefesh</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Neshama</em>, from the realm of <em>Beriah</em>, the realm of Creation, also know as the Throne Room, where there is the possibility of a meeting with <em>“Dmoot Elohim”</em>, the “Image of God (plural)”. The <em>sefirah</em> it is associated with is called <em>Chochmah</em>, Wisdom, and represents the Supernal Father, <em>Abba</em>, and it is where the two meet as one.</p>\n<p>This was to give you a taste of the depths.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-deeper:\" tabindex=\"-1\">And deeper: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama_in_hogsback/#and-deeper:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p><em>Ruach</em> (the Mother) is a masculine word, and <em>Neshama</em> (the Father) is feminine – and is often indicative of the <em>Shechinah</em>, the Divine Feminine! Like the breath/energy/spirit that nourishes Her children.</p>\n<p>Now the part that I wonder about is if we reach <em>Chayah</em> after death? Or is <em>Chayah</em> maybe manifested in Ascended masters here on earth? Or if <em>Chayah</em> is the ‘highest-self’, can we fully embody or attempt to embody our higher self in this life? Or do we move into that space momentarily from time to time? Also understanding it from a 4th dimensional concept – we do see we are very slowly moving into understanding that space. So does this then mean from this concept that when are on the <em>‘Neshamah’</em> journey, it might be possible to experience and live in <em>Chayah</em> at some point? I would like to discuss this more as many ideas go through my head on this one…<br />\nSuch lovely questions.</p>\n<p>Though, I would caution you to be too concerned about after your death… That has its own dynamic, its own set of constraints. Let’s rather focus on the life we are living, for that is all that is certain.</p>\n<p>Though it certainly seems that certain of us can Ascend to the level of <em>Chochmah</em> – where everything is seen as One. In order to manifest anything, and I mean anything, in this realm, the realm of <em>Assiyah</em>, Doing, we have to remove ourselves from the realm of Wisdom, and “enter”, or constrain our soul-selves to be able to “fit” into this dimension of interaction and communication that we are alive in. The same as if we are conscious of 4d and need to describe it in 3d terms, we would have to remove one axis of infinity to fit it into 3d… and that is an amazing thought…</p>\n<p>Metaphorically, “we are the eyes and ears of God having a human experience”.</p>\n<p>My conclusion is, that although it is possible to ascend to the upper realms, it is firstly impossible to remain there and remain active in this realm. Secondly, to do anything in the manifest realm, one cannot be still. Yet it is through stillness that you find guidance, and attain perspective. Thus even ascended masters will only be able to “visit” that realm – also by the very fact that we are existing here, therefore we can only be journeyers in any other realm. If we get stuck anywhere there, we are then most probably certifiably mad – living in a “disassociated” reality.</p>\n<p>However, those whom have emerged as such Masters, are also people who have, generally through committed practice over years, “cleaned out their channels”, that is, opened and purified the connection between themselves and the upper realms, and having devoted such a lot of energy to learning and practising techniques to do so, results in their having better contact between these upper (and lower) realms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-levels-of-soul\" tabindex=\"-1\">5 levels of soul <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama_in_hogsback/#5-levels-of-soul\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is my understanding of the 5 levels of soul. They are interconnected and interdependent. One seeks balance so that the energy can flow easily from the one component to the next. If the <em>Nefesh</em> is taken care of, the <em>Ruach</em> functions easily – there is evidence of this in our physical and emotional bodies. If we are malnourished our emotions are unstable. If our emotions are unstable we sometimes neglect to take care of our bodies. Moving one up – if our emotions are balanced our minds are sharper and there is more space to contemplate and think about things – our <em>Neshamah</em>. This is where a lot of us are, or are striving to be at this point. A strong <em>Neshamah</em> element equals a healthy emotional and physical and mental disposition IF we are in balance with it. Our practice is to stay balanced in this, the narrow middle road. To find this balance we require discipline, practice, commitment, discernment, integrity and humility in our spiritual practice.</p>\n<p>How to maintain that balance? Or how to find that balance? What is that balance? With what measurements do I judge balance?</p>\n<p>With this in the background. As we investigate the crystal better, we will understand where the various energies sit and what they vibrate to. There was a piece I once read on the Kabbalah, and the phases of the moon. That it was better to do certain rituals on the specific full moon that channelled a specific sefirotic energy.<br />\nOn a last note we can also explain the 5 elements the following way – <em>Nefesh</em> being the body, <em>Ruach</em> being the spirit, <em>Neshamah</em> being the soul, <em>Chayah</em> is a part of G-ds’ soul, and <em>Yechidah</em> is unpronounable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-two:-neshamah-in-hogsback\" tabindex=\"-1\">Part two: Neshamah in Hogsback <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama_in_hogsback/#part-two:-neshamah-in-hogsback\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We refer to the work we do here as Soul Work – hence we have called our space “Neshamah”.</p>\n<p>We recognize Neshamah in those seeking true spirituality. There is only one path to true spirituality; even though it has different cloaks. All ancient paths to true spirituality require discipline, practice, commitment, discernment, integrity and humility.</p>\n<p>As one can only speak from one’s heart to another’s, so one can only do soul work from one soul to another, and in sacred space. And the only way to communicate soul-to-soul is through a hollow bone, a n “empty” channel.</p>\n<p>The soul manifests through three elements, thought, emotion and action, yet its source is none of them, but it contains all three. Just as the soul may have levels that we need to explore rung by rung, so we need to gather the tools we will need for our journey from the wilderness to ascending Mount Horeb, the Mountain of Destruction, or would it be less scary to use its real name - the Mountain of Infinity.</p>\n<p>At Neshamah - we recognize the body, mind spirit connection,<br />\nAt Neshama, we seek to focus on the essential rather than the ephemeral, and we welcome those seeking spiritual sustenance to engage in soul work so that we may all be able to live in this world with fullness of our hearts, our minds and our souls.</p>\n",

Just as the shaman throws the water that the dark entities that she has removed from the person and placed in, onto the earth to “absorb” and dissipate in the belief that Mother Earth can absorb and deal with these dark energies. Just like the earth can ground us electrically when we walk barefoot upon her skin, so the female who identifies in her body with the earth, absorbs/receives the dark energy of the masculine, and can absorb and transform it in herself.</p>\n<p>The image that comes to mind is of a cloaking, a filtering – or, on a higher level, the guiding – of the masculine by the feminine, and consists of concentric circles.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/qkab/Diagram%20MF1%20-%20m&amp;f.png\" alt=\"m&amp;f\" /> Whereas the male forms a circle of protection for the female. He faces outward, protecting her from outside effects. She works from the inside, nurturing and keeping the home and thus faces inward. His protection has to not allow anything in that shouldn’t get in. Her’s is to allow the dynamic fire of the man to be expressed in the world, but needs to control it enough to be able to temper and guide it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/qkab/Diagram%20MF1a%20-%20Dynamics.png\" alt=\"Dymanics\" /> This is a diagram of the universal dynamics of the Yin and the Yang. Where the divine feminine, represented by the the circle, represented space – creation, in that sense. The space in which creation can exist and be nurtured. Though Kabbalisticaly she is called form, paradoxically in her Divine, she is space – which is the form from which everything emerges. Whereas the masculine, the Yang, is represented as the energy that moves the space to manifest, and is always represented by straight lines, or rather a vector movement. This is because energy always moves in a “straight” line – though it might be a 4d straight line, and look very squiggly in this dimension.</p>\n<h2 id=\"m-and-f\" tabindex=\"-1\">M &amp; F <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/masc_fem/#m-and-f\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>F: All life sustaining events are circular (what we refer to as light, productive, nourishing, &quot;informative&quot;, the energy is circular, used to sustain itself.

What if we viewed ourselves and our fellow beings as works-in-progress? Imagine everyone walked around with an &quot;under construction&quot; sign. Because who dies completely fulfilled? There is always something or, if you are lucky, someone left behind.</p>\n<p>Why not look at ourselves, our world, in fact the whole darn universe, as dynamic systems. Systems that are always in some sort of flux, some of which is obvious and some of which is not. There is so much that happens, and that could happen, that we are unaware of, and that affect us. We are like fish in the ocean. All we can do, as regards the ocean itself, is just live in it and with it. We can search for food, and harvest what we can from our surroundings - but the currents that bring the nourishment, and the sun that nurtures them, and the many complex events that have to occur in order for this food to arrive and this current to flow is beyond anything we can imagine, and this flux affects us, even if we are seemingly still &quot;who we were&quot;.</p>\n<p>Even in our lives we think we are a constant, and not in constant flux. Besides the fact that our body is, our emotions are, and our mind is constanly breathing, feeling and thinking. How balanced they are depends on a number of factors, but training and practice is at their core. But as we grow, we move from one &quot;type&quot; of person to another. I am not the toddler I was when I was born. I have grown from being the young boy I was cavorting around the garden. I am not longer the father I was to my young children. Although I might still be, and always will be, their father, I am not longer the father I was then, for they are grown with their own children. And so it goes on - till I die.</p>\n<h2 id=\"roles\" tabindex=\"-1\">Roles <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/masc_fem/#roles\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For the masculine it is about achieving something - and then he will be satisfied/happy. For the feminine is it about being in love &amp; happy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The &quot;success&quot; that the masculine achieves has to be constantly maintained and monitored. The more he achieves, the more attention these will demand from him. And one of the main tools of the <em>Sitra Achra</em>, the evil impulse, is to keep us occupied in the realm of the mundane so that we have no time to spend in the realm of the divine. That is to say that most of our day is taken up with mundane activities, most of our goals are empirical, and very little, if any, of our day is devoted to our relationship with the Divine. How many of your daily thoughts are taken up in contemplating what we don't know, what is not there? Being still and listening silent speech, rather than thinking and about the things and experiences and events of your own life?</p>\n<p>A man must learn to respond, then he must practise responding in a constrained and balanced fashion. The woman must learn to contain her responses, and choose the appropriate responses, and, interestingly, the appropriate time to respond.</p>\n<p>The role of the woman is well-defined, as the role of the man needs to be. The better defined that each role of the masculine is, the easier it is for the woman to be secure in her place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Love</strong> without vulnerability is not love at all</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Love, too, needs constant nourishment, though we know that material things are not what love needs - though gifts are always lovely. Admittedly, both men and women desire a materially comfortable life, that is not under question. And achieving that is a worthwhile goal. However, it is not sufficient to nourish love, though it might be sufficient to assuage the masculine, it certainly will leave the feminine in exile.</p>\n<h2 id=\"desire-for-power\" tabindex=\"-1\">Desire for Power <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/masc_fem/#desire-for-power\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The desire for power, greed, is a feminine trait.

The “threshing floor” and the “storehouse” are examples of Temple idioms that can be explored through ANE eyes to uncover meaningful spiritual applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"temples-in-the-ane-can-best-be-understood-as-a-house-built-for-a-god-by-his-king\" tabindex=\"-1\">Temples in the ANE can best be understood as a house built for a god by his king <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/threshing_floor/#temples-in-the-ane-can-best-be-understood-as-a-house-built-for-a-god-by-his-king\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Each of the great cities of ancient Mesopotamia featured large house/temple complexes. These temple compounds included an inner sanctum with additional chambers, a ziggurat (stepped pyramid) and a garden. The temple building itself was the home for the god, his chosen consort and his future seed. The garden, also part of this sacred space, was the field for planting seed and harvesting food for the family. The ziggurat, which enabled the god to descend from heaven to his second home on earth, was an altar where food from the garden was cooked and offered back to him. Sacrifices, therefore, played a major role in providing sustenance for the god and his entire household. The Temple in Jerusalem and its environs was structured in a similar fashion. The garden, described as a field, was for growing grain; the ziggurat was the altar or threshing floor for separating the grain from the stalks; and the Temple was the granary/storehouse for storing the seed grain for food consumption.</p>\n<p>The god and his new bride entered the temple’s inner sanctum, called the “couch,” during the annual New Year’s celebration. The sacred wedding coincided with a seven-day <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/threshing_floor/temple.html\">temple</a> dedication, and the couple’s union guaranteed a favourable destiny for the fertility of the land and the fruitfulness of the people. The Holy of Holies was also an inner sanctum within the Temple in Jerusalem. In a metaphorical sense, the Holy of Holies was the place for God and His bride, Israel, to take up residence and together produce new life. {In the same way, we can only produce a new &quot;spiritual&quot; life/path/paradigm/view by building the Temple for God and His Bride to...} Here the grain seed was stored in order to bring fruitfulness to the whole world. In reality, the Ark of the Covenant rested on the Foundation Stone inside the Holy of Holies, where it served as God’s earthly throne.</p>\n<p>Attached to the house/temple was a sacred garden where seed grain was planted, cultivated, and harvested as food for the entire household. The Garden of Eden functioned in much the same way. Adam, the gardener, also served as a priest and worked the garden to harvest food for his family and provide offerings for his God. The Hebrew word for garden is <em>gan</em> (גן). When the letter <em>resh</em> (ר) is added to the word <em>gan</em>, it becomes <em>goren</em> (גרן), which is a threshing floor. <em>Goren</em> can also mean the first place for the gathering of seed. The garden was “the field,” which according to the sages was a term related to the Temple complex. When Yeshua spoke of the field as the world, He was referring to the entire earth as the garden of God in the context of a cosmic temple.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Abraham called the temple ‘mountain’, Isaac called it ‘field’ but Jacob called it ‘palace’, this is none other than the House of God”. (Pesikta Rabbati 39.5) The Field chosen by Isaac on the Mountain where his father Abraham had bound him as a sacrifice would become the site of the Holy Temple, God's House of Prayer for all the nations.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>(Rabbi A. Greenbaum, Rejoice Reapers of the Field)</em></p>\n<p>Ultimately in the world of the ANE and the Bible, the concept of the house/temple went beyond the basic family unit to the community at large.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“The temple was the center of power and control from which the deity brought order to the human world. Fertility, prosperity, peace and justice emanated from there.”</em> (J. Walton, Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament, 127).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The temple was also the glue that held the community together. It was the central institution responsible for administrative, legislative, judicial and ritual functions, as well as for food production. As the viceroy in Egypt, Joseph served in the most important position in ANE society, Superintendent of the Granary, which made him overseer of the fields and the grains. He also set harvest dues, registered new lands in the name of the pharaoh, recorded border markers, gave land-leases and supplied the granary with seed grain. Although there are numerous interpretations for Joseph’s Egyptian name, <em>Tzafnat-Pa’neach</em>, which include “The Man to Whom Mysteries are Revealed” or “The Finder of Mysteries” (Josephus, Antiquities ii. 6). It is possible that instead of a name, it is really a title meaning “Nourisher of Life.” (R. Patai and R. Graves, Hebrew Myths, 263)</p>\n<p>Grain was one of the first foods to emerge from the Fertile Crescent and was a key factor that contributed to the rise of the developing world. Wheat grain, in particular, was one of the first crops that could be cultivated and harvested on a large scale. It also had the advantage of long-term storage, which was essential to feed large population centers, especially during times of famine. It has been suggested by some outside the mainstream that the Labyrinth (Greek for an Egyptian Temple), discovered in Egypt in 1888 by Professor Flinders Petrie, was actually built by Joseph as a palace and granary complex. This gigantic compound, with over 3000 rooms, could easily have served as an administrative and economic center for food production and storage. Situated on Lake Moeris, (90 km SE of Cairo) the complex was connected to the Nile River by an irrigation canal, which watered the adjacent wheat fields. Interestingly, the canal is called the <em>Bahr Yosef</em> or Waterway of Joseph.</p>\n<p>In ANE culture the threshing floor and granary were sacred spaces for marriage ceremonies and other religious rituals, which included seeing visions and receiving prophecies. The Egyptian god Osiris celebrated his revivification or renewal of life on the threshing floor of his temple. At the center of the threshing floor sat two large flat stones, one on the top of the other, fitted and joined together. The top stone was the female and the bottom the male. The “grinding of grain” alluded to the act of marriage, which brings to mind the story of Ruth and Boaz and their unusual encounter. Spreading the corner of Boaz’s robe over Ruth as she lay at his feet on the threshing floor was symbolic of an ANE proposal ritual (Ruth 3:9). The covering indicated Ruth’s submission to Boaz as the bride and his responsibility to protect her from an enemy who would seek to steal and destroy the grain seed. The consummation of their marriage and the resulting fruit indicated a clear victory over the enemy and the perpetuation of the family line that led to King David, whose seed ultimately brought forth the Messiah.</p>\n<p>King David also understood the spiritual significance of the threshing floor when the Angel of the Lord appeared to him standing in the place “between heaven and earth” (1 Chr 21: 15,16). According to tradition, the Angel likely stood on the Foundation Stone inside the Holy of Holies where the Ark of the Covenant would eventually sit. Once David recognized his own sin, [he asked for G-d's forgiveness, and was directed to purchase Ornah's threshing floor] he purchased the threshing floor from Ornan (1 Chronicles 21 always uses the Hebrew form Ornan from the Septuagint, 2 Samuel 24 uses three different forms - Ornah a Hebrew form from the Septuagint, as well as Aravnah and Arnyah both of an unknown ancient tradition substituted by the Masoretes) and set up an altar so the plague that was devastating his people would be lifted. He clearly recognized the significance of the altar as the threshing floor and its connection to his sin, God’s judgment, as well as God’s atonement and mercy.</p>\n<p>Ornan (ארנה) remains one of those truly enigmatic figures in the Bible. The fact that he owned the most important real estate in the world suggests his close association to the Temple and to the altar. The Hebrew letters in his name also indicate a special relationship to the High Priest Aaron - <em>Aharon</em> (אהרון) and to the Ark of the Covenant <em>HaAron</em> (הארון). These letters also form two important words, light (אור) and seed (נן).</p>\n<p>In addition, the Hebrew word for pine tree and the pineal gland, <em>Oren</em> (אורן), corresponds to Ornan. The pineal gland resembles a pinecone seed and functions as the light receptor in the body for regulating sleep cycles. A pinecone opens and closes based upon the amount of light it receives. Both clearly connect to “light” and “seed.” The pineal gland has been described as the “storehouse” of imagination and creativity, and is called the “Third Eye” because of its identification with the organ of spiritual vision and because it links the physical and spiritual worlds together, similar to the way a temple functioned. {pinecone -&gt; pineal -&gt; oren}</p>\n<p>In the ANE, grain was connected to various agricultural rituals and associated with the first fruit offerings and the celebration of harvest festivals. The same was true for Israel. The sages even called Israel the “first of the grain.” “In the beginning” (<em>beresheet</em> tyvarb), the first word of the Hebrew Bible, contains three interesting expressions: <em>bayit rosh</em> (var tyb), “house is the head”; <em>barah sh’tei</em> (ytv arb), “He created two”; <em>bar reisheet</em> (tyvar rb), “first grain”. The house, which is the head, is formed through the union of two, a husband and a wife who produce fruit, the first of which, in this case, is Israel. God alludes to Israel, which is called a beginning. (Rashi) Israel is holy to Adonai, the first (<em>reisheet</em>) of His crop (Jer. 2:3). The first fruit (<em>reisheet</em>) of the wheat harvest was offered at Shavuot (Feast of Weeks or Pentecost) when the Temple was standing. The period between Pesach (Passover) and Shavuot was a time filled with anxiety over the fate of the grain crop. The day the new grain was finally brought to the Temple was called “the closing of Passover” (Atzeret) and brought great relief to the community as the cycle of the seven weeks (Counting the Omer) was completed. Shavuot, called “The Day of the First fruits” was also known in Jewish tradition as the time of the giving of the Torah. Therefore, the Torah was given when the wheat harvest was ripe and the days of anxiety were over. To ripen to receive the Torah, Israel also needed seven weeks as the wheat required. The Torah was given seven weeks after the Exodus from Egypt, at the time of the wheat harvest, thereby uniting the spiritual ripening of Israel with the ripening of the wheat and with the bringing of the offering from the field. (N. Hareuveni, <em>Nature in our Biblical Heritage</em>, 64) During Shavuot a special bread offering called the <em>sh’tai haLechem</em> (two breads) was waved before the Lord in the Temple precincts as a reminder that <em>barah shtei</em> – “He created two” was for the purpose of making the two become one in order to produce fruit. The two loaves were symbolic.</p>\n<p>Wheat grain was one of the first crops harvested in Israel during May/June when there was a delicate transition between the dry, south-easterly winds (Gen. 41:6) and the moisture laden, north-westerly winds. Either could cause severe damage to the harvest. And you shall set the menorah on the south side of the tabernacle opposite the table and you shall put the table on the north side” (Ex. 26:35). Placed together in the Temple they symbolized the plea to the Creator that each wind would come at the right time. (N. Hareuveni, <em>Nature in our Biblical Heritage</em>, 37) The threshing floor was a level, circular and usually paved area. Sometimes it was located on a huge flat rock on top of a mountain where the underlying bedrock was exposed. Threshing floors had slight slopes for the water to drain. Both Solomon’s Temple and the temple Herod expanded were constructed on top of bedrock on Mount Moriah, referred to as the <em>Even Shettiyah</em> or Foundation Stone. Many scholars believe this is the likely location of the Holy of Holies where the Ark of the Covenant sat in the First Temple. Threshing literally means to separate the grain seed from the stalk. Once the grain was spread out on the floor, yoked oxen were driven around the floor to crush the grain with their hooves, or they dragged a heavy threshing board behind them to tear the ears of grain from the stalks. This was done to loosen the grain from the husks without damaging the seed. The true definition of <em>kadesh</em> (vdq, holy) is “to thresh” or “to be set apart.” The purpose was to produce abundant fruit. The One who supplies seed to the sower also provides bread for food and He will increase your seed and will increase the<br />\nyield of your righteousness (2 Co. 9:10).</p>\n<p>The bottom of the threshing sled was covered with razor-like metal blades. The front part of the threshing board was narrower and curved upward like a sled and the board was made from one piece of wood. Similarly, the Ark cover was made of one piece of hammered gold that also curved upwards. A description of the Ark of the Covenant in the book of Ezekiel indicates it may have resembled a threshing cart. Later threshing sleds were fitted with wheels to become carts. When David had the Ark of the Covenant moved by cart it was taken to the threshing floor of Nakhon. It was there Uzzah was struck dead for grabbing hold of the ark to steady it when the oxen stumbled. This was a sign that God’s judgment went forth from the Ark of the Covenant, His throne on earth. &quot;The nations will be gathered like sheaves on the threshing floor. Get up, start threshing daughter of Zion… I will make your hoofs like bronze. You will crush many peoples and devote their plunder to Adonai, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth&quot; (Micah 4:12).</p>\n<p>Winnowing was the final step necessary to thoroughly separate the wheat seed from the worthless straw (stalks, husks, any part that is not seed). The harvester scooped up piles of threshed wheat using large forks and tossed them into the air. The lighter chaff was carried away by the wind, while the heavier seed fell to the floor where it was swept up and stored in the granary for food and for seed to grow new plants. The threshing floor and the storehouse inspire rich visual images of the ancient Temple. The supernatural nature of that environment meant that everything and everyone serving within the temple precincts had to be separated from the contamination of the world. Impurity had to be removed and the method of choice, even in the spiritual realm, was the threshing sled. The sled served a dual function, as did the Ark of the Covenant. The heavy sled, when it was drawn over the straw and the ears, allowed for the ears to escape damage while the straw on top was crushed to pieces. What a compelling picture of judgment for the wicked represented by the chaff and atonement for the righteous represented by the life-giving grain seed!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It {before reaching the altar} at the altar <em>{flesh cannot reach the altar. one's &quot;body&quot; needs to be left at the entrance!}</em> that the flesh is beaten, pulverized and trampled so it can be destroyed. The flesh is the obstacle that prevents entry into the Temple {exactly!} and into the presence of the King who resides in the Holy of Holies. The flesh must first be crucified at the threshing floor, <em>{if you use the threshing metaphor, then that is why we say the blessing over the bread - for it is the bread/fruits of our &quot;spiritual&quot; labour that G-d harvests - not that of the material fruits of our labour. That is for ours.}</em> as it was for Yeshua the Messiah. It is a painful process, indeed, but necessary for producing fruit for the Kingdom. It is impossible to enter the Temple, especially the Holy of Holies, without first removing the flesh. Once the flesh is removed, the seed is ready to be stored as food <em>{but it is this spiritual manna that feeds the spiritual realm - i.e. G-d. And, just as with any sentient being, if you do not pay it attention and feed it, it becomes angry and will attack you for food!&quot;}</em> or it is fertilized <em>{these are all spiritual processes of which he is assuming that just happens. fertilisation is in itself an alchemical process to be successful}</em> to produce more fruit to feed the world as Joseph did in Egypt during the time of the famine. This underscores the eternal nature of seed and points to Yeshua as the model. He was the first of the grain seed (bar reisheet) whose flesh was crucified and destroyed. But from the threshing floor where He died, came resurrection and eternal life. For if a grain of wheat falls <em>{&quot;falls&quot; to the ground, indeed - just by chance. So you were &quot;lucky&quot; your Messiah &quot;died&quot; to produce a big harvest. However, this process happens regularly. It is a pattern we are familiar with. Your event seems to be a one time event. It has happened (according to your system) once so far in recorded (albeit mythological) history of humankind. No one else makes that claim. All, who have any messianic meme in their culture, believe that He/It is still to come. So, we have very little relative data to judge any of this with - except similar narratives in other cultures.)}</em> to the ground and dies, it produces a big harvest of even more seed. Paul &quot;calls upon believers everywhere to sow spiritual seed and to harvest an abundance of fruit&quot;. &quot;You are not to put a muzzle on an ox when it is treading out the grain… he who ploughs and he who threshes should work expecting to get a share of the crop. If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you… <em>{there is no &quot;coherent/human&quot; connection. For most, the connection is from above to below, and not much of a responding connection from below. The assumption that a spiritual threshing should produce a material harvest expresses a lack of understanding as to how the two are entangled. Firstly, and most importantly, the spiritual harvest is for the spirit, and the material harvest is for the &quot;body&quot;. What is G-d's give to G-d, and what is man's give to man.&quot;}</em> don’t you know that those who work in the Temple get their food from the Temple and those who serve the altar get a share of the sacrifices offered there?&quot;(I Cor. 9:9-13). _{Those who work in the Temple (spirit) get their food from the Temple (spirit), and those that work in the material, get their food from the material. Yes, I know what you will argue. That the work in the spiritual does not put food on the table. Then why does her say in the above quote: &quot;If you have sown spiritual seed... &quot;.}<br />\n_{This is the very point. The &quot;flesh&quot; that we need to remove, is not our flesh &amp; blood. No &quot;blood&quot; needs to be spilled. The &quot;blood&quot; of Christ refers to the spiritual &quot;juice&quot; that is available from the &quot;Christ channel&quot; - Jesus being the Christ made manifest in human form, so that we may recognise it. The flesh that one needs to rid oneself of is not literally your flesh, but the overarching attachment to the &quot;material&quot;, i.e. the &quot;Body of G-d&quot;, that Christ is representing - that needs to be sacrificed. The resurrection then occurs as a spiritual rebirth. It is in this incarnation that the sacrifice and the subsequent resurrection needs to occur. The Phoenix must rise from the ashes of your despair/pain. That is why Jesus rose again - not some other incarnation of the Christ. Thus, if one wishes to enter into the Holy of Holies, one needs to have rid oneself of this body. One can do it in one of two ways. Destroy the body - and then you are dead. Completely detach from your body, then you are looked at as mad, and will not be able to function fully in society. This will result in either guiding &amp; teaching others detachment, or it will be a descent into darkness and/or discomfort. Or one can try to reject one's body, ignoring its needs, even causing it pain and discomfort, in this constant dynamic of rejecting the very vessel which you've been given to have your soul experience. Or you could find a way of entering that space, moving this attachment to a desire for encountering or attaching yourself to the light.}_</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Blumenthal (referred to herein as UJM).</p>\n<p>The I Ching, the earliest Chinese text of systematic speculative thought, provides the source for a deep analogy with the 64 codons of the genetic code. Its Hebrew counterpart is the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>. It provides the source for the other half of the occult genetic code; the 20 amino acids and 2 stop codon groups.</p>\n<p><em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> is the earliest known work of Hebrew magical thought included in the subject known as Kabbalah or Qabala. It's title translates into English as &quot;Book of Creation.&quot; It was written between the third and sixth centuries. It is extremely brief, less than 2000 words, and is written in a terse and enigmatic style which has defied all attempts to completely clarify its meaning.</p>\n<p>The text tells how The Creator used the numbers 1-10 and the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet to create Universe and all the living things in it. The Hebrew letters are moulded like bits of clay, placed opposite each other and otherwise manipulated to create, in a magical way, all that exists.</p>\n<p>&quot;... <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> interprets the 'speech' of God in a very clear way. God did not talk to Himself, like an absolute monarch who wills and it is done. Rather, He generated substance, from which He formed letters, out of which he combined 'words', which became things. God's 'speech' was not sound but a modeling of units of clay.&quot; (UJM p. 46)</p>\n<p>&quot;... the author (of <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>) maintains that, using his interpretation, one can oneself become a &quot;creator&quot;; though on a much smaller scale. In other words, the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> proposes not only an interpretation of 'In the beginning' but also a secret teaching of creative magic. It teaches, properly understood, the secret of Creation and of creation, of the Maker and the maker.&quot; (UJM p. 9)</p>\n<p>&quot;... the reader is told 'test' and 'explore' (and in some manuscripts also 'know, calculate, and form') - i.e., to try to combine letters and numbers and to 'create' as God did. Such activity was, in fact, known in the Judaism of late antiquity. By it, some rabbis were reported to be able to create small animals and homunculi (animated clay men, who cannot, however, speak).&quot; (UJM p. 16)</p>\n<p>&quot;... at the conclusion of profound study of the mysteries of the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> on the construction of the cosmos, the sages (as did Abraham the Patriarch) acquired the power to create living beings.&quot; (<em>Kabbalah</em>, Gershom Scholem, Meridian Books, 1974, p. 352)</p>\n<p>&quot;When Abraham our father, may he rest in peace, came: he looked, and saw, and understood, and explored, and engraved, and hewed out, and succeeded at Creation as it is said, 'And the bodies they had made in Haran' [Genesis 12:5].&quot; (UJM p. 43)</p>\n<p>&quot;The Talmud, that great compendium of rabbinic literature, reports many instances of magic as practised by the rabbis. One example must suffice:</p>\n<p>What [magic] is entirely permitted?</p>\n<p>Such as [the magic] performed by R. Hanina and R. 'Oshaia, who spent every Sabbath eve in studying the Laws of Creation, by means of which they created a third-grown calf and ate it.&quot; (Talmud, Sanhedrin 67a, cited in J. Neusner, <em>There We Sat Down</em> (New York and Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1972), p. 80</p>\n<p>&quot;And this is the sign: He looks and speaks, and He makes everything that is formed and everything that is spoken with One term. And the sign of the thing is twenty-two needs in one body.&quot; (UJM p. 26)</p>\n<p>&quot;... The twenty-two needs of the body are not specified, although whatever they are, they correspond to the twenty-two letters of the alphabet.&quot; (UJM p. 26)</p>\n<p>&quot;Throughout the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>, the word for 'body' is <em>nefesh</em>, which is usually translated as 'soul'. The context here and at the end of the book calls for 'body', however.&quot; (UJM p. 32)</p>\n<p>So here, in the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>, we have a magical text which purports to allow those who understand and use it to create living creatures. This is accomplished using 22 letters which are manipulated like bits of clay into chains that are arranged into complementary parallels and other shapes. This is very similar to scientific descriptions of the activity which takes place within the cells of living things. Scientists use the language metaphor to describe these chemicals and their activities. Lengths of DNA and the genes which reside there are referred to as genetic sentences and their chemical components are referred to as words and letters. Counting the stop codons as 2 separate groups there are 22 amino acid letters in the chemical alphabet of life.</p>\n<p>&quot;2. Twenty-Two letters are the foundation: He engraved them, He hewed them out, He combined them, He weighed them, and He set them at opposites, and He formed through them everything that is formed and everything that is destined to be formed.&quot; (UJM p. 21)</p>\n<p>In addition to the numerical and functional analogies between the amino acids and the Hebrew alphabet there is a category coincidence as well. The letters of the Hebrew language in the Sefer Yetzirah are arranged into 3 categories.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Hebrew letters</th>\n<th>Count</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>English rendering</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>א,מ,שׁ</td>\n<td>x3</td>\n<td>Mother&quot; letters</td>\n<td>Aleph, Mem, Shin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ב,ג,ד,כ,פ,ר,ת</td>\n<td>x7</td>\n<td>&quot;Double&quot; letters</td>\n<td>Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Kaph, Pe, Resh, Tau</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ה,ו,ז,ח,ט,ִי,ל,נ,ס,ע,צ,ק</td>\n<td>x12</td>\n<td>&quot;Simple&quot; letters</td>\n<td>He, Vau, Zain, Cheth, Teth, Yod, Lamed, Nun, Samekh, Ayin, Tzaddi, Qoph</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The amino acids and punctuation codons have many chemical properties by which they can be categorized, but the simplest property describes how they behave within their watery environment of the cell. The amino acids can be described as either hydrophobic (water hating) or hydrophilic (water loving).</p>\n<p>12 Amino Acids are Hydrophilic: Serine, Threonine, Tyrosine, Histidine,<br />\nGlutamine, Cysteine, Asparagine, Arginine, Aspartate, Glutamate,<br />\nLysine, Glycine<br />\n8 Amino Acids are Hydrophobic: Valine, Isoleucine, Proline, Leucine<br />\nPhenylalanine, Tryptophan, Alanine, Methionine</p>\n<p>Since Methionine also serves to mark the starting point for translation on the mRNA strand, I put it in the &quot;Punctuation&quot; category along with the 2 stop codon groups. Therefore the 64 codons of the genetic code, those that code for amino acids and those that serve as &quot;Punctuation&quot; (start &amp; stop), can be put into the same number of categories with the same number of items in each, as the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>\n<pre><code> 3 Punctuation groups (2 stop groups, 1 start group [Methionine])\n 7 Hydrophobic Amino Acids\n12 Hydrophilic Amino Acids\n</code></pre>\n<p>This curious coincidence of similar categories was very useful when the time came to match up the individual Hebrew letters with their corresponding amino acids.</p>\n<p>THREADS</p>\n<p>When scientists speak of the chemistry of life they often use the metaphor of language, as pointed out earlier. They also use other metaphors. The strands of DNA or mRNA are also spoken of as &quot;threads&quot; and the entire genome is often refered to as &quot;the thread of life.&quot; I mention this because one of the many translations of Sefer Yetzirah which I have read uses the &quot;thread of life&quot; metaphor extensively.</p>\n<p>&quot;The twenty-two letters which form the stamina after having been appointed and established by God, He combined, weighed and changed them, and formed by them all beings which are in existence, and all those which will be formed in all time to come.&quot; (p. 20) (The Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis - AMORC, translated by Rev. Dr. Isidor Kalisch, 1877)</p>\n<p>The word that Kalisch translates as &quot;stamina&quot; is the Hebrew word yesod which others translate (more correctly) as &quot;foundation.&quot; Why Kalisch chose &quot;stamina&quot; is unknown, but its use in this context is provocative since it is derived from the Latin:</p>\n<p>STAMINA - the plural of stamen = warp: the thread of life spun by the fates. endurance. Greek stemon = thread. Note that: Stamen - the organ of the flower that produces the male gamete. This shows that &quot;the thread of life&quot; concept was linked early on to the process of reproduction.</p>\n<p>So, if we substitute the origin of &quot;stamina&quot; for &quot;stamina&quot; in the text, we get: &quot;The twenty-two letters which form the thread of life after having been appointed and established by God, He combined, weighed and changed them, and formed by them all beings which are in existence, and all those which will be formed in all time to come.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;This Torah, the linguistic movement of Ein-Sof within itself, is called a malbush (&quot;garment&quot;), though in fact it is inseparable from the divine substance and is woven within it ... (the garments) length is made up of the alphabets of the Sefer Yetzirah and had 231 &quot;gates&quot; ... which form the archistructure of divine thought. Its breadth was composed of an elaboration of the Tetragrammaton according to the numerical value of the four possible spellings of the fully written names of its letters, ... , which were the &quot;threads&quot; and the &quot;weave&quot; that were originally situated in the hem of the garment. ... The size of this garment was twice the area necessary for the creation of all the worlds. After it had been woven, it was folded in two: half of it ascended and its letters stood behind the letters of the other half.&quot; (Kabbalah p.132)</p>\n<p>We can see then that the tradition of the Hebrews uses the metaphors of clay and threads to explain the creation of all living things, including man. We pass now to the Chinese whose I Ching forms the other half of the occult genetic code. They too have creation myths and traditions that use similar metaphors. The following exerpts are from: &quot;Mythologies of the Ancient World&quot;, Samuel Noah Kramer Ed.</p>\n<p>Fu Hsi is the legendary creator of the I Ching. His sister/consort is Nu Kua. She is also portrayed as the creator of mankind:</p>\n<p>&quot;It is popularly said that when Heaven and Earth had opened forth, but before there were human beings, Nu-Kua created men by patting yellow earth together. But the work tasked her strength and left her no free time, so that she then dragged a string through mud, thus heaping it up so as to make it into men. Therefore the rich and the noble are those men of yellow earth whereas the poor and the lowly - all ordinary people - are those cord-made men.&quot; (p. 338)</p>\n<p>To wrap-up the analysis I will demonstrate some of the curious evidence derived from the Qabalistic practice of gematria, the practice of assigning number values to Hebrew words based on the numerical values of the Hebrew letters. Note that there are 46 chromosomes in the normal human. Each of the parents contribute, via their sperm and ovum, 23 chromosomes to the new being they create together.</p>\n<p>Note also that each of the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching has 6 lines and so there is a total of 384 lines in all.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Hebrew</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n<th>+</th>\n<th>=</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>חיה</td>\n<td>(life 23)</td>\n<td>(thread 23)</td>\n<td>46</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>אבא</td>\n<td>(father 4)</td>\n<td>(mother 42)</td>\n<td>46</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>אדם</td>\n<td>(Adam 45)</td>\n<td>(Eve 19)</td>\n<td>64</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>זרע</td>\n<td>(sperm 277)</td>\n<td>(ovum 107)</td>\n<td>384</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>זכר</td>\n<td>(male 227)</td>\n<td>(female 157)</td>\n<td>384</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Emet, Wolfson p156</p>\n<p>In the end, we come to where one cannot come except by not-coming, the manner in which many have come before and others will come after. We arrive at the terminus delimited as the limit always yet to be delimited, the limit beyond which there is no limit, and hence the limit of what cannot be delimited. Death is “a phenomenon that can be phenomenalized only in its coming to pass, for outside of this passage it cannot properly be; it appears, then, only to the extent that it comes to pass; if it didn’t, it could never be.”1 In the receding advance of the forward retreating, the inscripting of death’s erasure, truth is laid bare. Disclosing that erasure is a matter to be written from the evasiveness of the end that comes-to-be as the future that is always still-to-come, the time that is measured by différance, the deferral of meaning that can be apprehended only in and through the endless play of interpretation.</p>\n<p>[The same could be said of birth too.</p>\n<p>“Time,” wrote Paul Claudel, “is the way offered to all that will be to be no longer. It is the Invitation to die, for every phrase to decompose in the explicative and total concordance, to consummate the speech of adoration addressed to the ear of the Sigè the Abyss.”2 In its incessant passing, a necessary corollary to its interminable coming, time exemplifies something elementary about the nature of life as discerned from the (non)event of death, the “possibility of impossibility,” in Heidegger’s formulation.3 Human time-keeping is indebted to death as the signpost at the beginning of the end that illumines the way back to the end that was the beginning, the gathering of what will be scattered in and from the abyss of silence resounding in the sound of silence.</p>\n<p>Emet, Wolfson p158</p>\n<p>The sign at the end signifies that which (properly speaking) cannot be signified, the transcendent alterity opening time to eternity, not to be rendered in the Platonic sense of an immutable realm that stands over and against the temporal, but rather in the apprehension of the eternality of time and the temporality of eternity, a middle way that renders the traditional binary between evanescence and permanence obsolete.</p>\n<p>From a semiotic perspective, the inevitability of death as the ultimate (non)event in subjectivity compels human consciousness to articulate its own limit, positing a signifier that signifies what lies beyond signification. [Which is time itself...</p>\n<p>“The absence of a signified itself assumes the status of a signifier, disposing us to feel that behind this newly significant absence lurks a newly discovered presence.”</p>\n<p>. . . . .</p>\n<p>The ambiguity, the enigma.” The mark at the end is the marking of this enigma, “to think more than one thinks, to think of what withdraws from thought,” the ambivalence that blurs the ontological division of nothingness and being, the desire for the infinite that summons the “generosity of sacrifice outside the known and the unknown, without calculation, for going on to infinity. Not to be prevails as the decisive way to be. Should we have expected otherwise? Is expectation not this very coincidence of opposites, to await the return of what has never departed?</p>\n",

This guided experiential is pre-requisite to the journey to obtain a spirit-guide or power animal, for the inner shaman is also the one who does the shamanic journeying and consults with his or her spirit guides.

This hole is a little magical portal into a cave-like room...<br />\nYou notice a ladder that leads into that room. Gather your courage, for you know that you have to now enter this room. You climb down the ladder into this underground and earthen room entering into your body...<br />\nThere is a little fire on the floor, and the vague outline of spirit-beings dancing around the fire...<br />\nThrough flickering flames you see ancient drawings of animals and some handprints on the cave walls, and a few small bones and pottery shards on the dusty floor...</p>\n<p>Remove your shoes and socks and feel the cool softness earthen floor beneath your feet...</p>\n<p>You notice an opening...

A shaman is called or quests for the life-path of a shaman-self. This inner figure is like an inspiring muse, helping you in your life. It is sometimes called a daemon, or the shaman's higher self. It is a potentiality a pattern to be lived as integral to individuation/communitialisation. We are each called to a certain kind of self, and we have all of them in us as a potentiality. Some are called to an artist-self, others to a teacher-self or a leader-self, and so on. There are many callings. For a life to be authentic it must find the kind of life it is called to. In this experiential we have been exploring the shaman-self as a source of wisdom regarding your life purpose, and regarding your health and wholeness. Since we have all these archetypal potentials within us, anyone can explore the shaman-self, even if it is not your life-path. Consulting it can give you great insight into your own problems and health issues. Keep in mind that your Inner Shaman is not a spirit-guide or a power animal, for a shaman has those already. What we are accessing and awakening is your inner shaman, so that you can directly experience it, interact with it. I often lead apprentices into this experience before teaching them to shamanic journey, as part of an introductory workshop I call “Awakening the Shaman Within.”</p>\n",

As time goes by, we reach a level of cognition from and of our environment, and its topology. Our journey actually begins at this stage, and it might take many years, but the portal is an awareness of the other AND the effect we are having on the world around us. The end of the journey is of-course unattainable – and this is to be fully conscious of our world, both inner and outer, and the effect we have upon it. Then beings the hero’s journey into the inner reaches of your own self – what we call the soul, the <em>Nefesh</em> - that which I am in the world around me. But that is not the cause, not the first cause, and you begin to understand that as you head deeper into the reaches of your inner being. where you encounter forgiveness and responsibility. That you are responsible for what is happening in your life, and you also need to be responsible for what has happened in your life. You need to forgive yourself for what you have done that was not true to your inner purpose and will – as in <em>“Thy will be done, in heaven as on earth”</em>.</p>\n<p>Then, perhaps, you will be allowed into the next room in the palace. This is the place of the higher soul or spirit – <em>Ruach</em>, as if you have reached the throne room, where you encounter the breath (voice?) of the Divine, the all-powerful King of the Universe. It is then that you begin to experience awe and deep understanding of how it is all connected and full of spirit. Finally, you may be gifted with a glimpse of the Holy of Holiest, until you have realised that we are all part of a purpose that is so beyond purpose that it leaves you breathless.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-template\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Template <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/journey/#the-template\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What we need to understand, truly understand is that there is a template within which each one of us is born. It is commonly called your body.[^6] It is the skin, the barrier, that divides the inside from the outside. And the place where we live is inside this “external” template.[^7]</p>\n<p>Why do I say that there is a template? Generally, each one of us has, within certain extremes, the same physical template – differing only in some details – like colour of hair, eye-shape, size, height, etc. There are only very occasionally aberrant outbursts, but nothing truly untoward. Nor can our knees go backward, or do we have a hand on our stomachs. Each one of us is formed from the same template, perhaps you can think of it as the same idea.</p>\n<p>This is repeated, perhaps infinitely, out and in, above and below, large and small. Each atom is made from a template, which is quite well described nowadays. The galaxies are formed in similar ways, and gravity is gravity, however you interact with it. And we, and all of life, in fact, all of creation exist within the constraints of this template. That we cannot change. But we can be whatever we wish within the spaces of this template. That is the place of consciousness.</p>\n<p>We eat to feed the body. Food cannot feed the soul. It is our relationship with the food that will nourish the soul. Our “affinity” to it. Thus it is with everything that we interact act with. If we have a “soul-full” relationship with it, then it can satisfy the needs of our soul. If not , then it is available to feed <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/journey/sitra_achara.html\">something else</a> – like the banana peels, which you trash, that you throw out your car window. Where it goes we can speak of at another time, for that is not the topic under discussion, but that of creating the seeds of the web that we speak of as these are the heart spaces from which these seeds will come.</p>\n<p>The way we step into the physical reality that we exist in, is by commitment. For commitments define the lines upon which our structures are founded. Commitments used to be made with the spoken word. In the days when all a man had was his reputation which relied on his words – as much as his actions, we called it oaths and vows. In fact creation begins with words “And he said... let there be light.”</p>\n<p>Once we have commitment, <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/tol-framework.html\">the framework</a> can be built, which we have named “The Tree of Life Network. The covenant we are asked to accept is one of life – to nourish, protect, sustain all life. The commitment that you make is to the task of building a peaceful global nation, in which the majority of its population are living comfortably.</p>\n<p>The first task we need to perform is the calling. This is to make a connection with others who share our world view - one in which we believe that every relationship is sacred.</p>\n<p>A spiritual flame shows people how to act in a way that is more aligned with their experience of the Sacred.8</p>\n<p>Perhaps the quintessential element in this time that needs repairing is our relationship with our Mother Earth – though not the only factor – however, let us start there. That will bring us to the beginning - our food. That which the Mother offers us and provides us, as long as we honour her – as is said in the litany: “If you will follow My commandments, you will have rain in the season, and your crops will grow, and your trees will bear fruit.” As long as the flame burns, so it provide nourishment to the body and the spirit of the people.</p>\n<p>The journey starts from first principles. That first principle says that we are made both of body and of spirit. It is an acknowledgement of Spirit. Once we acknowledge that, we can then begin to investigate the Sciences of the Sacred. I am blessed to be the recipient of this Wisdom of our Ancestors.<br />\nBuilding</p>\n<p>Begin to build these communities, communities of communities. Call them sacred communities, or support groups, companies or whatever else you wish. I would like to call them “Communities of Truth”. These communities are made up of affinity groups. Small groups of people who are willing to make a commitment to one another.</p>\n<p>Start with a small commitment. To help out at a shelter, or to fix a shed, cook a meal for a sick person... If you can rely on a person’s word, you will begin to trust them.</p>\n<p>Think of it like starting a business, or a company.</p>\n",

At first I wanted to refer to it as the &quot;Web of Truth&quot; - but then the criterion of judgement of the Truth or Falsity of a statement is a complex, especially if socio-economic and political dynamics are in play. However, as Truth engenders trust, and people have different standards of trust - depending on their environment and cultural makeup. One has to gain trust, but prove truth. Therefore, we wish to build a Web of Trust, but basing it on Truth.</p>\n<p>A characteristic of complex systems is that they are self-organising. Which means that each element, including the element that contains all (or part) of these elements, &quot;self&quot; regulates, or regulates itself.</p>\n<p>{NOTE: This is a typical objectification, a separation. The same separation we make between us &amp; G-d - as something that exists outside of myself - which makes me &quot;self&quot; sovereign {sovereign to myself, and no one else}. We then have the option to reject or accept that outside element. Instead, we are entangled, so much so, t hat it is often difficult to tell the two - what is truly me &amp; what is G-d - apart.</p>\n<p>The most important things to keep in mind are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A perception of something is not the thing itself, but an &quot;imaginary&quot; or &quot;made-up&quot; version of the actual &quot;thing&quot;.</li>\n<li>There is not someone or something out there having an experience separate from your experience..

Even if we could record and retain all human knowledge, it would still be finite. How would we know that we have reached the limit of our &quot;intelligence&quot;. How does a child know learn that? By encountering those that know more than him, and hopefully, he can then learn to learn from others. Thus hopefully growing into an adult who can acknowledge his or her limitations, especially in the areas of intelligence! An old adage says that it is only a fool who thinks he has nothing more to learn.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finite-intelligence\" tabindex=\"-1\">Finite intelligence <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/limited/#finite-intelligence\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What if our intelligence was limited? Surely, we do not believe that we have infinite intelligence, do we? Even if there are those deluded beings who think that they are or can become, if not gods themselves, at least like gods - they know, in their true hearts, that they are not of infinite intelligence (or infinite anything - except for the &quot;part&quot; that can conceive of the infinite itself) - one has to acknowledge that not everyone has that capacity.</p>\n<p>Perhaps all this talk of level IV civilisations, stems around our ability to actually comprehend a technology that would be able to take us, whilst still in human form, as human beings to such an advanced and sophisticated level of empirical existence. This level of technological progress would require another set of cognitive capabilities - which most of us do not yet have. It would take (and has in the past) many years of training, and only those with specific talents would be able to complete it. All would benefit, and some would be harmed, but overall, it would require a certain set of &quot;special&quot; people - the &quot;Indigos&quot;, to penetrate these arcane veils. It would require a mixture of magic and form, a melding of the spiritual and the material - with angelic or 4th dimensional &quot;intelligence&quot;.</p>\n<p>As, in each step of evolution, there are those who will remain behind to hold the foundations. One cannot ascend to a higher level without the lower levels being stable and nourished. They will continue to transact and relate in the 3d and 2d realities present today. These will be the ones who will enter the World to Come, and like Bodhisattvas, will guide and balance the energies of these vibrant dimensions, bringing greater fulfilment and understanding to many - as they have done throughout the ages. The only difference now, is that this is the birth time of this evolution. History is littered with failed attemps, ideas that never made it to print, that later emerged. Or that emerged in a disjoint part of the world. When the time of an idea/direction comes, the idea will emerge.</p>\n<p><em>NOTE: Which would bolster the argument that we are going to need some other sort of understanding, some part of our mental capacities that we have not yet discovered/acknowledge, let alone plumbed - perhaps due to fear, we rather stay tethered to this purely material existence. At least it is rooted in something. As we have been saying for a long time - it will require a dynamic balance, between co-operation and competition for as to evolve.</em></p>\n<p>Perhaps our vaunted intelligence can only see so far. In other words, what if we are bounded in &quot;thought&quot; and comprehension. For the eye to see, the brain has to be able to evaluate what it is seeing. Otherwise, the data arrives, but nothing is done with it. It is indicative of the miles of printed paper that lies trashed and useless. In order for something to be seen, it requires a seer - i.e. transmitter/receiver!</p>\n<p>It seems that we are driven at this stage by the belief that we humans can design AI to &quot;increase our capabilities&quot;. I do believe we can/are able. Through bioengineering, we physically enhance the machine that is our body, but we do not enhance the mental or emotional capabilities. Thus it might produce a type of an android, or rather a Golem - a Frankinsteinian monster that we have built, but have no idea how to handle its emotional needs.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we extend ourselves to the limit of our consciousness...</p>\n<p><em>Which again, brings us to an interesting paradox, of actually, the belief in an infinite (or at least, greater) consciousness is what drives this desire to expand. There is a common desire to encounter the Infinite.</em></p>\n<p><em>Two ways:</em><br />\n<em>1. encounter to kill; pain of the rejection; feeling alone and despairing; having cried out to G-d, and not been answered (or so it seems). Has become this. So, rather than meet, it wants to devour and destroy everything that reminds him of his Father. This has much noise, much glam. It has to sell itself all the time, as exactly what it is not.</em><br />\n<em>{As I mentioned - one of its main drives is to (dis)prove the Infinite's existence - by encountering it and destroying it (which will prove that we are superior to that which bore/created us - and the world in which we exist by the way)}</em><br />\n<em>2. encounter to unify. meet by acceptance and receptiveness; opening oneself to the Truth. Based on a belief in my Father. That He has not abandoned me. That He guides me, and speaks to me all the time, in His language, the language of</em> Chashmal <em>, which can only be heard in silence.</em></p>\n<p>and then fall back. An ever repeating tower of Babel. That, too, is <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/limited/oroborus.html\">the cycle that lives in everything</a>, especially the living. Our breath, the day, the very cosmos itself. The endless cycle of Samsara, gain and loss, expand/contract, transmit/receive.</p>\n",

For G-d to say: &quot;All right, have it your way; what happens to you is of no significance&quot;; for G-d to act toward him as if He really does not care what happens to him. (<em>The Chassidic Master</em>)</p>\n<p>This point is illustrated by a story told by the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A wealthy businessman and his coachman arrived in a city one Friday afternoon. After the rich man was settled at the best hotel in town, the coachman went off to his humble lodgings. Both washed and dressed for Shabbat and then set out for the synagogue for the evening prayers. On his way to shul, the businessman came across a wagon which had swerved off the road and was stuck in the ditch. Rushing to help a fellow in need, he climbed down into the ditch and began pushing and pulling at the wagon together with its hapless driver. But for all his good intentions, the businessman was hopelessly out of his depth. After struggling for an hour in the knee-deep mud, he succeeded only in ruining his best suit of Shabbat clothes and getting the wagon even more hopelessly embedded in the mud. Finally, he dragged his bruised and aching body to the synagogue, arriving a scant minute before the start of Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, the coachman arrived early to the synagogue and sat down to recite a few chapters of Psalms. At the synagogue he found a group of wandering paupers, and being blessed with a most generous nature, invited them all to share his meal. When the synagogue sexton approached the paupers to arrange meal placements the town's householders, as is customary in Jewish communities, he received the same reply from them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Thank you, but I have already been invited for the Shabbat meal.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, however, the coachman's means were unequal to his generous heart, and his dozen guests left his table with but a shadow of a meal in their hungry stomachs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus the coachman, with his twenty years of experience in extracting wagons from mudholes, took it upon himself to feed a small army, while the wealthy businessman, whose Shabbat meal leftovers could easily have fed every hungry man within a ten mile radius, floundered about in a ditch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Every soul,&quot; said Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak in conclusion, &quot;is entrusted with a mission unique to her alone, and is granted the specific aptitudes, talents and resources necessary to excel in her ordained role. One most take care not to become one of those 'lost souls' who wander through life trying their hand at every field of endeavour except for what is truly and inherently their own.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Every person was born to a mission in life that is distinctly, uniquely and exclusively their own. No one—not even the greatest of souls—can take his or her place. No person who ever lived or who ever will live can fulfil that particular aspect of G-d's purpose in creation in his stead. (<em>The Lubavitcher Rebbe</em>)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"chok-statutedecree\" tabindex=\"-1\">Chok - Statute/Decree <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/j_cards/#chok-statutedecree\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p><em>If you walk in My statutes</em> (Leviticus 26:3)</p>\n<p>The word <em>chok</em> (&quot;statute&quot; or &quot;decree&quot;), which gives the <em>Parshah of Bechukotai</em> its name, literally means &quot;engraved&quot;. The Torah comes in two forms: written and engraved. On the last day of his life, Moses inscribed the Torah on parchment scrolls. But this written Torah was preceded by an engraved Torah: the Divine law was first given to us encapsulated in the Ten Commandments, which were etched by the hand of G-d in two tablets of stone. When something is written, the substance of the letters that express it—the ink—remains a separate entity from the substance upon which they have been set—the parchment. On the other hand, letters engraved in stone are forged in it: the words are stone and the stone is words. By the same token, there is an aspect of Torah that is &quot;inked&quot; on our soul: we understand it, our emotions are roused by it; it becomes our &quot;lifestyle&quot; or even our &quot;personality&quot;; but it remains something additional to ourselves. But there is a dimension of Torah that is <em>chok</em>, engraved in our being. There is a dimension of Torah which expresses a bond with G-d that is of the very essence of the Jewish soul. (<em>Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi</em>)</p>\n<p>A rabbi once offered the following analogy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Every Jew is a letter in the Torah. But a letter may, at times, grow somewhat faded. It is our sacred duty to mend these faded letters and make G-d's Torah whole again.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"galut-(exile)\" tabindex=\"-1\">Galut (Exile) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/j_cards/#galut-(exile)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In <em>galut</em> (&quot;exile&quot;) the Jewish conscience lies dormant, the soul unable to express and actualize its G‑dly awareness and feelings. The cure to this state of spiritual coma is the Jew's selfless submission of the role he must play in the Divine plan--a role that transcends emotion and intellect. It is this simple loyalty to G‑d that restores the Jew's essential relationship with Him.</p>\n<p>Though Mordechai was a Benjaminite, he is called <em>Yehudi</em> (&quot;Jew&quot;) which literally means a descendant of the tribe of <em>Yehudah</em> (Judah). Likewise, throughout the <em>Megillah</em>, the entire Jewish people are called <em>Yehudim</em>, without distinction of tribal origin. For <em>Yehudi</em> is of the same root as <em>hoda'ah</em> which means &quot;to acknowledge&quot; and &quot;to accept&quot;. This title describes the core of the Jew, his untouchable essence.</p>\n",

The analogy is the removal of an infective splinter from a person's body: the pain that is experienced is not a &quot;punishment&quot; as such for the person's carelessness, but an inevitable part of the healing process itself. The fact that a foreign body has become embedded in living flesh and has caused its decay makes its removal a painful experience. By the same token, when something alien to the soul's bond with G-d has become embedded within it, the extraction of this alien body, and the healing of the bond, is experienced as painful to both body and soul.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"energy\" tabindex=\"-1\">Energy <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/cards/#energy\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Energy that does not have form cannot be represented in this world. It can only be recognised through its interaction with some other &quot;form&quot;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is only mathematics that is able to represent or describe this energies that do not have a manifest form like gravity or electricity. However, in the latter case there seems to be a form or order inherent in the energy&amp;mdsh;a form which is itself only probable—which we can conveniently refer to as packets, or, as the wont is nowadays, quanta. Thus we intrinsically believe that there will be a similar form for Gravity. Though what if there is not? For all of this has been created not just for God's or our pleasure, but for our learning. Somehow, we were lost, or, as we refer to it biblically, fallen. Perhaps we are errant souls or expressions of some desire for self identity existing in the plurema. However that may be, we are here and dream always of the world to come in which the evil that roams the world will have been banished or demolished. And perhaps gravity will be a koan to lead science deeper into the mystery of creation.</p>\n<p>The only way we are made to be aware of this subtler energy is through its effect.</p>\n<p>The quantum arena speaks of such energy. We feel it's effect in our everyday lives with our cell phones and other wireless devices. Yet there is an even more subtle energy, and it's one that vivifies everything, and we call it life when we see it move, and inanimate when it doesn't. Yet they all react to input and energy affects their structure and sometimes their behaviour too. So, they are in some sense alive.</p>\n<p>Focusing on a more personal experience of life, I would like to ruminate a moment on sleep, in the context we have been discussing previously.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;When a person climbs into bed, his soul leaves him... (<em>Tishby Wisdom of the Zohar</em>, 1:121b, note 8, p203)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;This soul fills the body, and when a person sleeps she ascends, drawing down life from above' - R' Me'ir (<em>Tishby Wisdom of the Zohar</em>, 2:809-12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a result of human sin, <em>Shekhinah</em> is enslaved to Lilith, the demonic feminine, channelling the flow of emanation to the demonic.</p>\n<p>The abundance of the earth is in all. All designates Yesod, who transmits the entire flow of emanation to <em>Shekhinah</em>, symbolised by the earth—and through Her to the worlds below. So it is with the energy of life.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"dawn\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dawn <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/cards/#dawn\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Awaking at dawn for no reason, l realize why we wake just before dawn to say the morning prayers. It is the time when the light first enters the darkness and parallels the creation which contains the mystery of the light and darkness, speaking of the darkness as that which existed before creation, and the light as the expression of the vitality of the Presence. This principle is of the highest order, in that the Presence does not move, or express itself in any form or fashion that we might be capable of comprehending. Only a quality, or appellation of Its presence could we ever comprehend, or indeed, even experience.</p>\n<p>As the light gathers, and slowly, majestically, elegantly and gracefully begins to penetrate the darkness of the night, garbed and adorned in all her joy, twinkling and flirtatious, as the day could never be, so did the Will of G!d, b'h, gather to manifest the creation. In the same manner we gather our intention, our will prior to manifesting in this realm. It is like the seed about to burst, the egg on the verge of cracking. And the thoughts you are thinking will affect the waters of your day.</p>\n<p>If what you thought could manifest in your day, and this is decided by the wisdom of the lord, which is far greater than any could apprehend, it will. If not then it gathers in the pool of its manifestation. When this pool gets full, it will overflow and begin to travel down the tree of manifestation, until, unless prevented by the guardians of the heavens, it will begin to express itself in this world.</p>\n<p>Is it the same with your emotions? One student asked. And what about your actions? Another might query.</p>\n<p>Well, that is why we come to the place of the dawn prayer, which preferably must begin before it is light, just as it begins to gather, say 10 or 15 minutes before dawn. The prayer speaks of G!d's greatness. It extols His glory. And prays that we be spared from the influence of the lamp of darkness, that we not be overcome by the evil tongue and that our enemies of spirit be kept far away. It calls to us to focus on the Divine Presence. Firstly in us, and in our environment, and prepare us for its unveiling through the magnificence of the emerging light.</p>\n<p>But here, through the prayer and our gathering focus on the Divine light, we empty our emotional waters, allowing the peace of His presence to bathe and cleanse them. Our actions are similarly simple and direct. We invoke the morning gratitude and wash our hands, and pray. We cleanse our space and place our prayer shawl on our head and shoulders to &quot;shield us under thy mighty wings&quot;. Now we are ready for the binding. We have bowed to Your Will, and invoke your mercy and protection and accept the yoke of your teaching and once again swear to abide by your commandments, for you are our salvation - and as we swear our oath we bind our forearm , and place portions of the scroll to cover our third eye, with the laying of the specially prepared leather tefillin --as they are called.</p>\n<p>The day has dawned, and having seeded it in this manner, the light that first enters, the prime order night</p>\n<p>He occupied, or possessed, רכש, the middle. In order to create the middle required some emanation, thus it says he &quot; emanated the emanations&quot;. But it was from the middle that that was done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gan-(glimpse)\" tabindex=\"-1\">Gan (glimpse) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/cards/#gan-(glimpse)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here is a brief glimpse of a description of the dynamics of the spiritual realm as seen and shared by our Rabbi's. Remember that this is an attempt to explain it, taking from the Hebrew and translating it into another language, another way of expressing this entanglement between the spiritual and the material realm.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the basis of the tradition all of these attributes [of G!d] in the six extremities are also called “garden” [<em>gan</em>], as it says, “The Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east” (Gen 2:8), that is to say, from before [<em>mi-qedem</em>]<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/cards/#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> the creation of the world . . . and, in truth, Eden refers to <em>Hokhmah</em>, [Wisdom - one of the ten emanations], the inception of all the emanations [<em>ro’sh le-khol ha-sefirot</em>], which is intimated in the word <em>bere’shit</em> (ibid., 1:1), and the <em>Targum Yerushalmi</em> translates it as <em>be-hokhmata</em> [“by means of wisdom”], and the rabbis, blessed be their memory, said,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/cards/#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup> “even the word <em>bere’shit</em> is a saying” [in the tally of the ten sayings by means of which the world was created]. Hence, Eden is the inner Wisdom [<em>ha-hokhmah ha-penimit</em>] in which are engraved the thirty-two paths of wisdom, and it is like a spring and like the root for all of them and for the garden. And the garden is like a tree that has many branches, from its head to its foundation, and it is nourished constantly from the root, which is the spring that comes forth from <em>Ein Sof</em>, and it spreads forth from the source without separation and without cessation, without day or hour, even a second, and this is the intent of what is written “the river goes forth from Eden to irrigate the garden” (Gen 2:10). River [<em>nahar</em>] is from <em>Nehora</em>, and this is the inner light [<em>ha-or ha-penimi</em>] that issues constantly from Eden. Therefore it says “goes forth” [<em>yotse</em>] and it did not say “went forth” [<em>yatsa</em>] for it does not cease, and in every moment it emanates in these attributes [<em>we-khol et hu mitpashet ba-middot</em>].<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/cards/#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\" />\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The expression <em>mi-qedem</em> can assume two connotations: “from the east” (the sensus literalis of the verse) and “from before” (the meaning assumed by Asher ben David). <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/cards/#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Babylonian Talmud, <em>Rosh ha-Shanah</em> 32a. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/cards/#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Asher ben David, R.

It has to become the anchor upon which your life is tethered.</li>\n<li>Relative: past &amp; future<br />\nThe past is like sight. Depending on the perspective/the line upon which you gaze, you will see your past - which is the only real past you know. All the rest, what we call history, are narratives (generally told by the victors) and guesses as to what actually occurred. But the only experience you have of the past, is those you have had, that you have lived.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To know, to experience, to perceive of something as relative, there needs to be an absolute frame (expressed as a point) of reference.

Same as a parent/child relationship; or perhaps a teacher/student; or, best, a mentor &amp; a novice.<br />\nThink of the first time a child &quot;gives&quot; something to its parent. How the parent delights in that gift. Whether it is the smile of a baby, or the scribbles of a young child, most parents value it for years. Think of a student that passes his grades, how proud is the teacher. Or a novice that understands the teachings, and the teacher knows that he is on the right path. So it for our Lord and Master, the Shepherd that bore us.</p>\n<p>It seems that the constraint that holds most of us, is around our lack of giving towards our parents, and thus our ancestors - upon whose shoulders we stand. We seem to lack in compassion and forgiveness even for those who bore us, and sustained us, until we were able to make our own decisions (even the bad ones). We have forgotten about <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/cards/honour.html\">honour</a>, and respect and decency - which implies, nay requires, some sort of code or covenant. In the same way, and I think this is the root cause, we no longer pay respect to our Creator. But, like spoilt children, we resent what we have been provided, always looking at, and desiring, what we don't have - and never taking responisibility for the mess we ourselves have created.</p>\n<p>Shamanically: &quot;Magic of their Alchemical Union&quot;.

The latter removes all pleasure, making the experience rather torturous. That is the role of the teacher/mentor, to constrain the pupil, and by constraining him, he attains his form. But before that, he needs to be anchored. This is important. First the person needs to anchored, fixed - in the beginning one could say tethered or chained to the goal. This is through an oath or vow that he or she needs to declare. Once his position has been fixed, the teacher can then begin to teach and the constraint will form the student, not break him or her.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choice\" tabindex=\"-1\">Choice <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/cards/#choice\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You have a choice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That of being constrained by your own will</li>\n<li>or not - then you are allowing yourself to be constrained by the will of another.<br />\nDue to the truism that to overcome your own weaknesses is the most difficult battle of all, thus there are many defeated by their own desires. The conclusion is that one needs help. If one seeks help from another, one runs the risk of falling under the other's influence, and not really acting from one's truth.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The only solution to this dilemma is to &quot;create&quot; an ideal, and to aim for that ideal. The most common and tested version of that is G-d, or some variant thereof. As long as that variant contains the same characteristics: Perfect, Absolute, Infinite, Unknowable Oneness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attractreject-posneg\" tabindex=\"-1\">Attract/Reject - Pos/Neg <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/cards/#attractreject-posneg\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In the physical universe, like rejects like and opposites attract.</li>\n<li>In the spiritual universe, the opposite occurs: Like attracts like, and opposites oppose.<br />\nThe counter force to that, is that we can only desire (which is &quot;spiritual&quot;, not physical - which works on a purely pain/pleasure reaction) that which we do not have! Not the opposite of what we have...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now the interesting aspect to this is that upon choosing, which is imposing constraints, you encounter, and attract, more choices. In other words, the &quot;fruiting&quot; happens through constraint. So through removing energy from extraneous attractions, one focuses more energy on the choice. Which then grown stronger. And thus produces more fruit. By choosing, and thus removing all the other possibilities (<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/cards/wave_collapse.html\">wave collapse</a>)</p>\n<p>However, if you continue to make no choice, and thus take no action, you reduce your choices, until you find yourself in a place of not being allowed to choose - a place of &quot;no-choice&quot;, which, G-d forbid, is to be in the realm of true evil.</p>\n<p>The felt reaction to the &quot;no-choice&quot;, that of allowing some &quot;other&quot; impulse to direct your actions, is one &quot;guilt&quot;, and in that place, the desire for constraint arises. [Remember, can only desire what we don't have. After (over-)indulging in one of my pleasures, a feeling of guilt arises. Guilt at having sinned. Guilt at having wasted pleasure. Added guilt because of the need to keep the sin secret. Which often is accompanied by lies... and more guilt. The only way of assuaging the guilt at this stage is by &quot;penance&quot;, which means some sort of constraint (which could include pain/punishment). Thus the lack of constraint in that specific area is balanced by an excess of constraint in some other area - perhaps completely disconnected, but in most cases there is a threat that the <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/cards/clairvoyant.html\">clairvoyant</a> (one with clear vision) can see.</p>\n<p>[NOTE: Clairvoyant: one with clear vision. We don't have any names for the other 5 senses. Just an edge here. There is the shaman, who walks between two worlds. There are many types of shamans: healing with herbs/medicine; soul work. They speak of him walking between two worlds. That is because he is interacting with the spirit of mother earth (<em>Shekhina</em>?). However, a clairvoyant, in my eyes (which is what I am) is one who sees the other world - whether Shaman or not. A <em>Mekubal</em>, is one who studies, empirically, phenomenologically, and theoretically, the other spiritual realms (he is generally not interested in the non-spiritual)]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is fear but the memory of pain, and the hope to avoid it in the future?

Moreover, the notion of simultaneity must have been in the mind of humankind even before its conscious articulation, for when at the dawn of civilization prehistoric man observed the stars in the sky and thought that they were where he saw them, he conceived the idea of an all-pervasive “now.” In this conception his mind implicitly applied the notion of distant simultaneity as a necessary component in the mental process of distinguishing his self from the world that surrounds him.</p>\n<p>This does not mean, however, that he already possessed a distinctive verbal expression for this abstract notion at this early stage. The question of how he performed the transition to such an articulated expression is related, of course, to the general problem of the origin and development of language. We focus, therefore, on only a few metalinguistic remarks that are relevant to the notion of simultaneity. Particularly relevant to our subject is the claim made by Edward Sapir and his disciple Benjamin Lee Whorf that “all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/2_Concept/#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"footnotes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Footnotes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/2_Concept/#footnotes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\" />\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>B.

As far as semantic considerations are involved, it suffices at this stage to define the term “simultaneity,” as understood by common sense, as the “temporal coincidence of events.”</p>\n<p>The earliest recorded term that has been interpreted as denoting simultaneity is the Egyptian hieroglyph <img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/hieroglyph-h3w.png\" alt=\"h3w\" /> [missing],<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> which is a “term, that denotes the simultaneity of events.” As the egyptologist Eberhard Otto showed, however, the original meaning of this term was not a temporal but rather a spatial relation denoting “local proximity or neighbourhood.” It is therefore probably also the earliest known example of the metonymical use (the use of one word for another) of spatial terms to denote temporal relations that is frequently encountered both in ancient and in modern languages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup> Today we still speak of a “short” or “long” interval of time; we say “thereafter” instead of “thenafter,” or “always” instead of “at all times.” In fact, we will soon see that the word “simultaneity” itself is such a metonymy.</p>\n<p>Let us first point out that in his statement that the hieroglyph denotes “simultaneity of events,” Otto did not use “event” in the sense in which it is used in modern physics. The term “event,” derived from the Latin “e-venire” (to come out), was used at the time of William Shakespeare<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup> to denote an occurrence, process, or phenomenon of indeterminate temporal duration, just like its German equivalent “Ereignis.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup> In the terminology of modern physics, however, the word “event,” just like “Ereignis,” became a technical term to denote “an occurrence of negligible spatial extension and temporal duration.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\">[5]</a></sup> The use of the term in this sense gained general currency, especially with the advent of Einstein’s 1905 relativity paper, in which the definition of simultaneity is followed by the statement “a system of values x, y, z, t . . . completely defines the place and time of an event.”[^8] In his 1907 review paper[^9] Einstein called such a system a “Punktereignis” (point-event). Hermann Minkowski, in his famous 1905 lecture on space and time, called it a “Weltpunkt” (world-point).[^10] Finally, let us quote from the introduction of a recent treatise on relativity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We shall adopt the point of view that the basic problem of science in general is the description of ‘events’ which occur in the physical universe and the analysis of the relationship between these events. We use the term ‘event,’ however, in the idealized sense of a ‘point-event,’ that is, a physical occurrence which has no spatial extension and no duration in time.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using henceforth the term “event” in this sense we can rephrase our preliminary definition of simultaneity as follows: event $e = (x, y, z, t)$ and event $e' = (x', y', z', t')$ are simultaneous if and only if $t = t'$. This thus defined simultaneity will also be called “event simultaneity” to distinguish it from what we call “interval simultaneity,” which refers to continuous sequences of events,called “processes” or “occurrences,” and which we define as follows: process $p$, beginning at time $t_1$ and ending at time $t_2$, and process $p'$, beginning at time $t_1'$ and ending at time $t_2'$, are simultaneous if and only if $t_1 = t_1'$ and $t_2 = t_2'$. If the distance between two simultaneous events is negligibly small we speak of a “local simultaneity,” if not, we speak of a “distant simultaneity.”</p>\n<p>Returning now to the hieroglyph mentioned earlier, we see that its interpretation as “simultaneity of events,” as suggested by Otto, does not agree with our definition of “event.” For having always been used in combinations like “at the time of the reign of king...,” where “at the time” was expressed by that hieroglyph, it obviously refers not to events but rather to what we call “processes.” But even its interpretation as “interval simultaneity” would be inaccurate; for the intervals or processes under consideration, say $p$ and $p'$, have temporal durations $\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$ and $\\Delta t' = t_2' - t_1'$, which, in general, do not satisfy the condition that $t_1 = t_1'$ and $t_2 = t_2'$, but only the weaker condition that$\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta t'$ overlap, that is, are not disjoint (symbolically, $\\Delta t \\subset \\Delta t' \\neq 0$). Such processes will be called “contemporaneous” in agreement with the etymology of the term “contemporaneity,”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\">[7]</a></sup> which derives from the Latin “cum” (together, in common) and “tempus” (time). In our terminology the above-quoted hieroglyph denotes therefore not “simultaneity of events” but rather “contemporaneity of processes.”</p>\n<p>The interchange of the roles of space and time in the concept of “distant simultaneity” leads to the notion of events that occur at different times at the same location. Note that in contrast to “simultaneity,” which plays an important role in the philosophy of space and time, this space–time-transposed analogue has never been found worthy of any philosophical reflection. In fact, it has never been given even a term of its own unless we accept the term “local recurrence” as a terminus technicus. The term “contemporaneity,” however, has a space–time transposal, namely “collocation,” derived from the Latin “cum” and “locus” (“place”), but it has been used since the seventeenth century primarily with respect to the arrangement of words in the field of literature. From the purely etymological point of view this terminological asymmetry between spatial and temporal terms has no justification, because the etymology of the term “simultaneity” assigns to it no preferential temporal connotation. Its etymological root is the Latin “simul,” which in turn derives from the Sanskrit “sem” (or “sema”), meaning “together,” both in the sense “together in space” and “together in time.” It still survives in the German words “zu_sam_men,” “_Sam_mlung,” as well as in the Nordic expressions “_sam_tidig” (“simultaneous”), “_sam_tidighet” (“simultaneity”), and so on. In the Greek language “sema” became $&quot;\\breve{\\alpha}\\mu\\alpha&quot;$ (hama),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\">[8]</a></sup> which was used by Aristotle, for example, in the sense of “together” not only in the temporal sense. Although the German language retained, as we have seen, the Sanskrit root “sem” in several of its words, it never used it to form a term denoting “simultaneity.” Instead, it combined the words “gleich” (equal) and “Zeit” (time) to form “Gleichzeitigkeit” (simultaneity), a term listed previously, and probably for the first time, in Justus Georg Schottel’s dictionary of the German language in 1662.</p>\n<p>To avoid equivocations it is imperative to distinguish sharply between certain terms that are often, and in many languages, employed as synonymous with “simultaneity.” Because the terminology involved is almost the same in all languages we confine our discussion to the English language. The most important of such terms are “synchronism” and “isochronism”. The authoritative <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> defines “simultaneous” as “existing, happening, occurring, operating, etc., at the same time; coincident in time.” It defines “synchronous” as “existing at the same time; coincident in time; belonging to the same period, or occurring at the same moment of time; contemporary, simultaneous.” Finally, it defines “isochronous” as “taking place in or occupying equal times; ...equal in duration, or in intervals of occurrence ...taking place in the same time, or at the same time intervals of time, as something else; equal in duration.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\">[9]</a></sup> Webster’s popular <em>New Collegiate Dictionary</em> identifies “synchronous” with “happening at the same time; concurrent in time; simultaneous.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\">[10]</a></sup> The Oxford English Reference Dictionary states explicitly that both “simultaneous” and “synchronous” denote “occurring at the same time.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\">[11]</a></sup></p>\n<p>This apparently incorrect treatment of different, albeit related, terms as synonyms should not be regarded as an error. When these terms were introduced into the English language or given currency in it, they were usually interpreted in accordance with their etymology. Consider, for example, the term “synchronous”. It derives from the Greek $&quot;\\sigma\\acute{\\upsilon}\\nu&quot;$ (together) and $&quot;\\chi\\rho\\grave{o}{\\nu}o\\varsigma&quot;$ (time). By combining these two words some authors introduced the term in the sense of what we now call “simultaneous,” others in the sense of what we now call “synchronous,” for both interpretations agree with the notion of “together in time.” Similarly, the term “isochronism,” derived from the Greek $&quot;\\grave{\\iota}{\\sigma}o\\varsigma&quot;$ (the same) and $&quot;\\chi\\rho\\grave{o}{\\nu}o\\varsigma&quot;$, was interpreted by some as denoting “simultaneity,” by others as what we now call “isochronism,” when we speak, for example, of the isochronism of vibrations.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the modern usage of the terms “simultaneity,” “synchronism,” and isochronism” we distinguish one from the other and explain this difference in terms of their most important application, the use of clocks. As stated in the beginning of this chapter, we define “simultaneity” as the “temporal coincidence of events.” Assuming we have two clocks we regard the coincidence of their hands with certain numbers on their dials as an event. Then we can say that the clocks are “synchronized at a certain moment of time” if and only if at that moment of time the hands of the two clocks are in the same position, that is, they indicate the same time. If this condition is also satisfied at an arbitrary later moment of time we say that the clocks are “synchronized during an interval of time” or simply “synchronized.” If the positions of the hands of the two clocks are the same at a certain moment of time they constitute two, generally separated, simultaneous events. It is therefore clear that the notion of “synchronism” involves or presupposes the concept of “simultaneity.” It is also clear that “synchronism” always refers to two (or more) clocks. In contrast, the term “isochronism” refers to one and only one clock, for we say that a clock is “isochronous,” if and only if it “runs” at a constant (or uniform) rate, that is, if the periods between consecutive “ticks” are equal. Here we face the problem of how to verify that two consecutive time intervals (or, more generally, two temporally separated time intervals) are equal. We cannot shift the later time interval into the position of the preceding (or earlier) time interval. The generally accepted method of calibrating time intervals with the duration of the rotation of the Earth, which defines the length of the mean solar day, is based on the assumption of a uniform rotational velocity of the Earth, but this assumption is not strictly correct because the tidal frictions of the oceans, for example, decelerate the rotation of the Earth. As a closer analysis shows,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\">[12]</a></sup> even an appeal to the law of inertia, according to which a particle, not subjected to any interaction, moves with constant velocity, that is, moves through equal distances in equal intervals of time, would be of no avail.</p>\n<p>Another temporal term, intimately related to “simultaneity” but not identical with “simultaneously,” is the adverb “now.” The English term “now,” like the Latin “nunc” and the Greek $&quot;\\nu\\tilde{\\upsilon}\\nu&quot;$ derives from the Sanskrit “nu.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\">[13]</a></sup> It deserves our attention not only because it is an “indexical”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\">[14]</a></sup> term, related to simultaneity, but also because, as we will see in due course, it probably expressed the earliest human awareness of the conception of simultaneity and it played an important role in Aristotelian and medieval philosophy. In modern times Hans Reichenbach classified it as a “token-reflexive word, comparable in this respect with ‘I’, for it means the same as ‘the time at which this token is uttered.’”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\">[15]</a></sup> Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his discussion of time-language,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\">[16]</a></sup> declared that “the function of the word ‘now’ is entirely different from that of a specification of time” and has a logic of its own. Einstein, “said that the problem of the Now worried him seriously. He explained that the experience of the Now meant something special for man, essentially different from the past and the future, but that this important difference does not and cannot occur in physics. That this experience cannot be grasped by science seemed to him a matter of painful but inevitable resignation.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\">[17]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The relation between “now” and “simultaneity” has scarcely ever been discussed. A noteworthy exception is Eugen Fink’s statement: “The fundamental meaning of the Now is that of a universal simultaneity ... it contains the whole world-wide extent of the simultaneous,” a statement that perhaps explains Einstein’s worry, because his theory of relativity denies the existence of a universal simultaneity. A comprehensive discussion of “simultaneity” cannot ignore the relation between this concept and the “now,” even if it is true that such a relation holds only, as some philosophers of language contend, in what they call a “tenseless language.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\">[18]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In classical physics, based on the Newtonian conception of absolute time, which “flows equably without relation to anything external,”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\">[19]</a></sup> and on the assumption of the existence of instantaneous actions at a distance, none of the terms “simultaneity,” “synchronism,” “isochronism,” or “now” raised any conceptual difficulties.</p>\n<p>Even a notion like “spatial recurrence” in the meaning of repeated presence at the same local position, whether of an object, event, or process, had a clear-cut meaning in Newtonian physics, according to which “absolute space, in its own nature, without relation to anything external, remains always similar and immovable.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\">[20]</a></sup> In modern physics, however, which denies the existence of absolute time, absolute space, and instantaneous actions, all these terms or notions involve serious problems as we will see in due course. Finally, note that, in conformance with our terminology, spatially separated events can be defined as simultaneous if synchronized clocks, located in their immediate vicinities, indicate the same readings at the occurrences of these events. Clock synchronization and simultaneity are therefore intimately related concepts, at least insofar as the operational establishment of one of them assures the existence of the other.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"footnotes:-chapter-2\" tabindex=\"-1\">Footnotes: Chapter 2 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/1_Terms/#footnotes:-chapter-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\" />\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See, for example, A.

For a similar reason Friday, 30 June 1905, may be called the “birth-day” of the theory of relativity, for on that day Albert Einstein’s seminal paper on the special theory of relativity was received by the editorial board of the <em>Annalen der Physik</em>.</p>\n<p>Priority questions are generally, and rightly, regarded as nugatory and not worth mentioning. In the present case, however, the claim that, despite the chronological precedence of the birth of the quantum theory, it was Einstein’s 1905 relativity paper that initiated the conceptual revolution of modern physics was made most eloquently not, as may be expected, by a relativist but by one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, Werner Heisenberg. In his Gifford Lecture, delivered at the University of St Andrews in the winter semester 1955/56,<br />\nHeisenberg declared:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Within the field of modern physics the theory of relativity has played a very important role. It was in this theory that the necessity for a change in the fundamental principles of physics was recognized for the first time.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar statement had already been made by Heisenberg in 1934 when he said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The fundamental presuppositions of classical physics, which led to the scientific picture of the 19th century, had been challenged for the first time by Einstein’s special relativity.”<br />\n“It was the assumption that it is meaningful without further consideration to call two events simultaneous in the case they do not occur at the same place.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Heisenberg’s statement, that Einstein’s 1905 analysis of the concept of distant simultaneity (i.e., of spatially separated events) inaugurated the modern physical world picture, can be confirmed by the fact that Einstein himself once admitted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“By means of a revision of the concept of simultaneity in a shapable form I arrived at the special relativity theory.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A magniloquent formulation of Heisenberg’s claim was given more recently by the cosmologist Julian B. Barbour:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Einstein’s definition of simultaneity opened the door into a world as unexpected as the one inadvertently discovered by Copernicus when trying to save uniformity in the heavens.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Heisenberg, who knew, of course, his teacher’s statement concerning the birth of the quantum theory, could nevertheless make this priority claim because he realized that the philosophical implications of a new physical theory did not necessarily need to be recognized at the birth of that theory. Indeed, as we know from documentary evidence, prior to 1906 Planck and his colleagues thought it was possible to “fit” the constant <em>h</em> into the conceptual framework of classical physics.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup> However, Einstein’s 1905 relativity page immediately left no doubt that the classical notions of space and time could no longer be maintained.</p>\n<p><em>It was precisely because of its revolutionary innovations that the more conservative members of the editorial board of the Annalen considered the paper, with its seemingly bizarre notions of time dilation, length contraction, and relativity of simultaneity, written by a clerk of a patent office, more as a piece of “science fiction” than as a serious scientific work. Thus, what later was called “possibly the most important paper that has been written in the twentieth century”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\">[5]</a></sup> might have been returned to its author as unfit for publication had it not been for Planck, who as the representative of the German Physical Society was the chairman of the editorial board and who immediately understood the paper’s importance.</em></p>\n<p>It would be wrong to assume that this notion became the subject of critical attention only with the advent of the theory of relativity. The fact that many philosophers, including such prominent thinkers as Aristotle, Leibniz, and Kant, thought that this notion required closer analysis seemed not to be well known, certainly not among physicists. Einstein’s treatment of this concept has a noteworthy prehistory that can be traced back to antiquity. It also has an equally important posthistory. As Graham Nerlich, a philosopher of the University of Adelaide, rightly remarked in 1982: “It is hard to overestimate the impact of Einstein’s definition of distant simultaneity on philosophy in this century, set, as the words were, in the context of a highly successful theory of physics.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p>To show that such a statement is justified, at least as far as the philosophy of physics is concerned, it suffices to recall that, in accordance with the theory of relativity, even such an elementary concept as the length of a line segment or of a rod, moving relative to an inertial system, involves the concept of distant simultaneity. That not only temporal but also spatial measurements depend on the notion of simultaneity follows from the simple fact that “the length of a moving line-segment is the distance between simultaneous positions of its endpoints,” as Hans Reichenbach, in the chapter entitled “The Dependence of Spatial Measurements on the Definition of Simultaneity” in his influential book <em>The Philosophy of Space and Time</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\">[7]</a></sup> convincingly demonstrated. Having shown that “space measurements are reducible to time measurements” he concluded that “time is therefore logically prior to space.” Since, in turn, the notion of time, as Einstein demonstrated in 1905, presupposes a definition of simultaneity, it is clear that, indeed, the importance of the concept of simultaneity for kinematics, and therefore for physics in general, can hardly be exaggerated.</p>\n<p>This holds especially for the theory of relativity. For instance, P. F. Browne rightly pointed out that all relativistic effects are ultimately “direct consequences of the relativity of simultaneity.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\">[8]</a></sup> Or as Ernan McMullin wrote: “The ‘relativity’ of the new theory—one of the most solidly verified theories in the entire range of physics—is chiefly, therefore, a relativity of simultaneity.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of the major problems debated by philosophers of science in our time is the controversial question of whether the concept of distant simultaneity denotes something factual, empirically testable, or at least unambiguously definable, or whether it refers to merely an object of a convention, that is to an arbitrary stipulation without any factual content, as to which events are to be called simultaneous. This “problem of the conventionality thesis concerning the concept of distant simultaneity” has far-reaching implications. If, as mentioned above, the concept of distant simultaneity is a fundamental ingredient in the logical structure of the theory of relativity but is in reality nothing but a convention, the question naturally arises of whether this does not imply that the whole theory of relativity and with it a major part of modern physics are merely fictions devoid of any actual content. A positive answer to this question would have disastrous consequences for the philosophical understanding and epistemological status of physics and with it of the whole of modern science.</p>\n<p>The concept of simultaneity also plays a significant role in other branches of physics, in particular, in quantum mechanics. A well-known example is the quantum-mechanical entanglement {such as the one exhibited in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen type experiments,} where the outcome of spatially separated measurements are instantaneously correlated. Indeed, “the uneasiness of fit between relativity and quantum mechanics regarding the treatment of measurements hinges on the concept of simultaneity.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\">[10]</a></sup></p>\n<p>As we will see, the notion of simultaneity also plays an important role in classical physics. Unfortunately, textbooks in the physical sciences, unless dealing exclusively with the theory of relativity in general, completely ignore the notion of simultaneity. A noteworthy exception is Herbert Goldstein’s excellent text on classical mechanics which states explicitly at the beginning of its first chapter that “basic to any presentation of mechanics are a number of fundamental physical concepts, such as space, time, simultaneity, mass and force.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\">[11]</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of the major objectives of this treatise is to show that this concept has occupied the attention of philosophers and scientists throughout the whole history of human thought and played an important role in the writings of such intellectual giants as Aristotle, St. Augustine, Leibniz, and Kant.</p>\n<p>It would be a serious mistake to associate the concept of simultaneity exclusively with philosophical or scientific reasoning. In fact, it was at the level of prescientific apprehension, a fundamental ingredient in the process of human apperception and conception of time. As Gerald James Whitrow pointed out, “our conscious appreciation of the fact that one event follows another is of a different kind from our awareness of either event separately.<br />\nIf two events are to be represented as occurring in succession, then—paradoxically—they must also be thought of simultaneously.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\">[12]</a></sup></p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"footnotes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Footnotes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#footnotes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<h2 id=\"introduction-1\" tabindex=\"-1\">Introduction <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/simultaneity/0_Introduction/#introduction-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\" />\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>W.

Just as it had been used to &quot;encode&quot; other languages like Portuguese, or German, it could be used to express (almost) any language. The &quot;letters&quot;, that is, reading and writing of Hebrew could always be taught, irrespective of the &quot;texts&quot; that were used to teach it. Only the select few, those who were worthy would be allowed access to the &quot;true&quot;, and secret teachings - the mysteries - which were written in Hebrew - but could only be understood properly by those who had been taught the &quot;language&quot; i.e. the concepts and components of the system that they described. In other words, it could be hidden in plain sight. Almost as if it had been encoded, and you need the keys to decode it.

This is an eye for an eye, a life for a life - to balance the scales of &quot;justice&quot; - type of philosophy.<br />\nWhat I refer to as a two-dimensional viewpoint. There is a this and a that, and two wrongs make it right? Besides, this deception that we are referring to here, was perpetrated by two direct lies from son to father.</p>\n<p>There is also the question of the Isaac's part in this deception. Why did he ask Jacob twice if he was Esau? He was old and blind, but surely he could differentiate his sons. He even mentions that his voice sounds like Jacob's.</p>\n<p>It is no longer acceptable to justify our Partriarch's acts in the light of present beliefs. If we are to face our own darknesses and come to an understanding and ability to balance them, we need to learn how to do that again in our religion/<em>halacha</em> That foundation which is built upon the righteousness of our Patriarch's perfection no longer works for us. Jacob cannot be thought of as righteous at this stage of his life, though he rose to righteousness, and is thus know as a <em>tzadik</em> But, instead of arguing against your conclusion, I will offer another view.</p>\n<p>Jacob is the first patriarch to show human qualities. He is also the father of our nation, for we are בני ישׁראל. Yet here he is still a boy, still Jacob. He has not yet wrestled with his angel, during his dark night of the soul, and become <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_toldot_deception/israel.html\">Israel</a>{Israel, the holy land, is not only (or necessarily) a place, but is also essentially a process - for a place without process is dead}, our Father.</p>\n<p>I stole money from my mother's purse when I was a little boy. That was Julian. Now, having grown up, and learn about these transgressions - I grew up to become Yehuda ... However, &quot;growing up&quot; is the incorrect/incomplete phrase for what is occurring. It is a phase of learning, of exploration and experiencing - and hopefully one gains wisdom.</p>\n<p>Jacob had to learn about the spiritual. We can only learn about the spiritual in the material. But we can only experience the spiritual through the spiritual - while still being engaged/entangled in the material. Thus, Jacob is described as innocent. He was a &quot;man who dwelt in the tents&quot; - which also points to the fact that he had not yet experienced the world.</p>\n<p>To experience the spiritual, you have to disengage from the material. The more completely you disengage, the deeper and more impactful will be the experience. It is similar to a dance movement. You have to disassemble the previous move in order to move into the position. The more completely you disengage, the better you will be able to express the following movement. If anything is left over from the previous movement, it will be carried into the next, and influence it. In fact, it is likely your balance will be off, as it will contain leftovers from the previous move.</p>\n<p>However there is a WARNING that is necessary to include here. Because of the enchanchement of the spiritual, it is possible to become so enamoured of it, that one forgets that it is G-d's will that has fashioned creation for us to do our work here, and that work needs to be done in our physical bodes. So if you connect to the spiritual, follow these principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not lose the golden thread.</li>\n<li>Make sure it is formed from the purest gold.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"golden-thread\" tabindex=\"-1\">Golden Thread <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_toldot_deception/#golden-thread\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When one decides to explore the spiritual, the realm of the not-material, non-empirical, one can easily get lost or confused, thus it is essential to maintain the &quot;golden&quot; thread, between you and your bodies presence in order to be able to find your way back when you need to return. One could literally refer to this thread as a lifeline. When in the spiritual space, you need to remind yourself constantly that you are a human being having a spiritual experience, just as when we are in manifest space, we need to constantly remind ourselves that we are a spiritual being having a human experience - through prayer and ritual.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gold\" tabindex=\"-1\">Gold <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_toldot_deception/#gold\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Gold has long been the symbol of purity, wisdom and the spiritual.

In that case, it should be known as the Second Deception and that's is perhaps why Jacob lied twice. Once in the pure spiritual Garden of Eden. The second being the descent into being &quot;human&quot;, with all the flaws, that began with the fall of Adam &amp; Eve, from beings of light, to beings that were &quot;clothed&quot; in flesh. {Man -&gt; man-i-fest}.</p>\n<p>Rather than thinking about it as a straight line, think of it as a spiral, one strand in the double helix - one ascending, one descending; one masculine, one feminine...</p>\n<p>{Thus Abraham, masculine, and Isaac, feminine, and Jacob again masculine... till Joseph and the emergence - as in 1,2,3... many.<br />\nI say Isaac in feminine, because that is also how he is portrayed in the Torah.

This has happened before, and could be happening again. The Baal Shem Tov was the Tzaddik who expressed the people's disconnect with the our learned sages of the time. Now, after the holocaust, in which so many of our Tzaddikim were slaughtered, times have changed. Up till now, the Rabbonim have held us, and taught us. Are we strong enough to face what awaits, and not lose our faith?</p>\n<p>Story of the Menstrual Rag. He disassociated from his surroundings. Even used to set things alight.</p>\n<p>Jacob, who had spent his life growing up in the tents of learning, now had to taste of the real life, the life of lies and deceit, of greed and jealousy, of power and pain in order to grow and learn. He needed to experience life in order to understand G-d. If I have never loved, how can I know what love is. I cannot ever learn about love, no matter how many texts on love I devour. That is why it culminated in his struggle with the Angel.</p>\n<p>We see that he even has a similar bifurcation with his wives. The beautiful Rachel, and the plain, yet more able, Leah - who gave him many children, while Rachel gave him barely two. This also speaks of one of the basic male dilemmas.</p>\n",

For the wood and stone of the palace he had no tears, but for the crown jewels, passed down for many generations—for these there was no consolation.</p>\n<p>The king gathered his wise men, but none could give counsel. The jewels had been scattered by those barbarian hordes throughout the land and throughout many other lands, the most precious of them taken across the seas to the farthest reaches of the globe. But the king had a daughter very dear to him, and in her wisdom she saw what needed to be done.</p>\n<p>So the king and his daughter trained many pigeons to return to the palace, to recognize the crown jewels and carry them back on their journey. Each day they would release the pigeons in the pastures about the palace, and some would discover the jewels scattered about and return them to their home. And the king was glad and smiled to his daughter.</p>\n<p>Then the king’s daughter sent them further away, and again they returned, carrying a few more of the jewels her father had lost. As far away as they were sent, they hastily returned.</p>\n<p>But the most valuable jewels, those in the most distant lands and most hidden places, those jewels had not yet been recovered. The pigeons did not venture far enough to find them—they were too eager to return home.</p>\n<p>The king’s daughter knew what must be done, but she could not tell her father, for it was too hard, too dangerous, too awful. But he looked in her eyes and he knew. And so he destroyed his palace once again, razing it to the ground, removing its every trace. When the pigeons attempted to return, they found nothing, no more than an empty pasture with scattered stones and smouldering wood. They were hungry for their food and sick for their home.</p>\n<p>Until the most adventurous of the pigeons travelled far abroad and found other palaces, and in those palaces they found hidden the king’s most precious jewels, and gathered them and polished them and kept them in their wings. And at night they cried, for they knew this was not their home.</p>\n<p>And now has come the time for them to all return.</p>\n<p>I can’t explain to you everything meant by this story. If I could, what would I need a story for? I would just explain it to you without the story. But I can tell you some of the teachings that form its basis.</p>\n<p>For one, you need to know what the great Kabbalist Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, known as the Ari Hakadosh (“The Holy Lion”), taught about our world. He taught that there is not a thing in this world that does not contain a holy spark. Even the greatest evil, even the harshest darkness that does everything it can to oppose its Creator and deny any purpose or goodness in the world, even that contains a divine spark. And it needs that spark, because without it, it would not be able to exist for even a moment. Why, then, is it evil? Because the spark it contains is so dim, so concealed, that its only way of expression is to be the opposite of what it truly is.</p>\n<p>So you might think that if that spark is so dim, it couldn’t be a very important spark. Maybe G‑d could do without it. But the Maggid of Mezeritch taught just the opposite, that it is the highest sparks that fall furthest from their source. So in places that are warm and friendly to holiness, there are going to be some warm and friendly sparks. But if you want the most powerful sparks, the sparks that talk about the real essence of G‑d, then you need to deal with the places that are furthest from their source.</p>\n<p>As long as all these sparks are held hostage in things and places that don’t know the real meaning of what they hold inside, the world is not fulfilled. That is how the Ari describes Torah and Jews: they are the way those sparks become reconnected to their source.</p>\n<p>There is one other thing I would like to say about this story; the rest I will leave to you. In our history, the pattern of destruction and exile has repeated itself many times. We began in exile, in the land of Egypt. Then there was the destruction of the first Holy Temple and exile to Babylonia, and then the second destruction and a very lengthy exile, which we still endure. There is no other nation that has been spread so far apart, yet retained identity as a single whole, always with hope to return. And all of it was part of His divine plan, to retrieve all the sparks of holiness. Which is what we did, because wherever we go, we use the materials, the foods, the music, the customs of that place in a Torah way.</p>\n<p>But as far as I am concerned, the greatest destruction and the greatest exile began seventy years ago. Because, until then, if a Jewish person was looking for a teacher and a guide to find his or her path to G‑d, or just looking for some spirituality in life, there were tzaddikim just around the corner, and everyone knew that was so. But when the communities of Europe were suddenly and brutally destroyed, along with all but a handful of the great tzaddikim, that is when the greatest darkness began. That is when this bizarre detour began, that if a Jewish soul wants to find meaning, she goes to drink from the wells of others. True, she will never be satisfied from those wells, since they are not her own. But a soul that lived for 3,300 years basking in spirituality simply cannot bear the dry, parched land.</p>\n<p>And, unfathomable as it may be, that had purpose as well.</p>\n<p>But now has come the time for us to all return home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-faith-of-the-farmer\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2650/jewish/The-Faith-of-the-Farmer.htm\">The Faith of the Farmer</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_toldot_annexes/#the-faith-of-the-farmer\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Based on the teachings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe<br />\nCourtesy of <a href=\"https://meaningfullife.com/\">MeaningfulLife</a></p>\n<p>Therein lies the specialty of the faith of the farmer. The farmers contact is with the densest, most opaque part of the veil. He is slave to the weather, the contours of the land, the chemistry of the soil; he contends with nature in its rawest, most obstinate, most dictatorial incarnation. So when the farmer recognizes and acts upon the truth that it is the Vivifier of the World who answers his toil with sustenance, this represents the ultimate triumph of faith, the ultimate penetration of spiritual vision through the material haze.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-final-temple\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/52755/jewish/What-Was-the-Holy-Temple.htm\">The Final Temple</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_toldot_annexes/#the-final-temple\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>By <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/search/keyword_cdo/kid/2893/jewish/Hecht-Mendy.htm\">Mendy Hecht</a></p>\n<p>With the destruction of the second Temple, G‑d changed His mode of interaction with the universe. Until the destruction, the Temple was the window to G‑d; spirituality had a physical home in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>With the destruction, G‑d temporarily removed the Temple from its geographic location and placed it within us. Instead of traveling to Jerusalem, G‑d wanted us to find Him in our inner Jerusalem. Now, our bodies are our Temples, our souls are our windows, our minds are our <em>kohanim</em> and our animal instincts are our sacrifices. We cannot offer physical sacrifices three times a day, but we can pray three times a day. We cannot attend Temple services three times a day, but we can tap into our souls three times a day. We cannot atone for our shortcomings by sacrificing animals, but we can sacrifice our inner animals—our hormones, our lusts, our desires, our beastly compulsions. We cannot find G‑d in Jerusalem; we must find Him in us.</p>\n<p>If the times of the Temple were principally G‑d reaching down to His world, then the times of our exile are us reaching up, from within that world.</p>\n<p>This is G‑d’s master plan. First, a sweeping, dramatic outdoor concert of public spirituality, reaching viscerally and tangibly into the everyday, physical reality. Then He exchanges this for an internal, personal, private experience, forcing us to reach up to find Him, bringing the entire Creation along with us. Together, the two experiences lay the groundwork for the third and final Temple—an age that will synthesize both directions of spirituality. An age of where G‑d’s presence inside our hearts and minds and in the physical world is internalized to achieve a whole new reality: the era of <em>Moshiach</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"life-on-the-inside\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2551/jewish/How-to-Change-the-Past.htm\">Life on the Inside</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_toldot_annexes/#life-on-the-inside\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>By <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/search/keyword_cdo/kid/90/jewish/Tauber-Yanki.htm\">Yanki Tauber</a></p>\n<p>In reply, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak said to his son-in-law: &quot;We cannot make our days longer, nor can we add additional hours to our nights. But we can maximize our usage of time by regarding each segment of time as a world of its own. When we devote a portion of time — whether it is an hour, a day or a minute — to a certain task, we should be totally invested in what we are doing, as if there exists nothing else in the world.&quot;</p>\n<p>Chabad-Chassidic teaching devotes much discussion to the quality of <em>penimyut</em>. Amongst Chassidim, the greatest compliment one can pay a person is to say that he is a <em>penimi</em> — one who possesses the trait of <em>penimyut</em>. The greatest insult is to call someone a <em>chitzon</em>, which is to say that he lacks <em>penimyut</em>.</p>\n<p>What is <em>penimyut</em>? The closest equivalent word in the English language is &quot;innerness&quot;. <em>Penimyut</em> means integrity, thoroughness and consistency. It is the opposite of superficiality and equivocation. In the <em>penimi</em>, knowledge cannot be divorced from experience, and knowledge and experience cannot be divorced from deed. You will never encounter only parts of the <em>penimi</em> — his brain, his heart, his actions; rather, you will always find the complete person there. The <em>penimi</em> doesn't merely think a thought, experience a feeling, do an action — he lives them.</p>\n<p>When the penimi devotes a portion of time — whether it is an hour, a day or a minute — to a certain task, he is totally invested in what he is doing, as if there exists nothing else in the world.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that the penimi lives indiscriminately. On the contrary, indiscrimination is the ultimate mark of the <em>chitzon</em>. The penimi is deeply aware — aware of the differences between important things and things of lesser importance, between means and ends, between journeys and destinations. But in whatever he is involved, he is fully there. He's never just &quot;getting it done&quot; or &quot;getting it over with&quot;. When he's on the way to something, he's fully invested in being on the way to something.</p>\n<p>This week's Torah reading includes Moses' record of the Israelites' 42 &quot;journeys&quot; through the desert — forty-two journeys which, according to rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, are replayed in every individual's personal journey through life.</p>\n<p>The 42 journeys are, of course, phases and stages in a greater Journey — the progress from the confines to Egypt to the Promised Land. But each is also an entity unto itself — the Torah calls them &quot;journeys&quot; (<em>massaot</em>), not &quot;stations&quot;. We're not here to get through life, the Torah is telling us; we're here to live it.</p>\n<p>Yes, we are physical beings; but there is something in us that transcends the physical. Man is an amalgam of matter and spirit, a marriage of body and soul. It is our spiritual self that persists in the belief that the past can be redeemed. It is our connection with the spiritual essence of our lives that grants us the capacity for teshuvah--the capacity to &quot;return&quot; and retroactively transform the significance of past actions and experiences.</p>\n<p>What is this &quot;spiritual essence&quot; with which we seek connection? And how does it enable us to literally change the past?</p>\n<p>Not just man, but every object, force and phenomenon has both a &quot;body&quot; and a &quot;soul.&quot; A thing's body is its physical mass, its quantifiable dimensions, its &quot;hard facts.&quot; A thing's soul is its deeper significance—the truths it expresses, the function it performs, the purpose it serves.</p>\n<p>By way of example, let us consider the following two actions: in a dark alleyway, a knife-wielding gangster attacks a member of a rival gang; a hundred yards away, a surgeon bends over a sedated patient lying on the operating table. The &quot;body&quot; of these two actions are quite similar: one human being takes hold of a sharp metal object and slices open the belly of a second human being. But an examination of the &quot;soul&quot; of these two events—the desires that motivate them, the feelings that suffuse them, the aims they seek to achieve—reveals them to be vastly different deeds.</p>\n<p>In other words, man is a spiritual creature in that he imparts significance to his deeds and experiences. Things don't just happen—they happen for a reason, they mean something, they further a certain objective. The same event can therefore mean different things to different people; by the same token, two very different events may serve the same purpose and elicit identical feelings, imbuing them with kindred souls despite the dissimilarity of their bodies.</p>\n<p>The body of our lives is wholly subject to the tyranny of time—the &quot;hard facts&quot; cannot be undone. A missed flight cannot be unmissed; a harsh word uttered to a loved one cannot be unspoken. But the soul of these events can be changed. Here we can literally travel back in time to redefine the significance of what occurred.</p>\n<p>You oversleep, miss that flight, and never show up for that important meeting. The initial significance of that event: your boss is furious, your career suffers a serious setback, your self-esteem plummets. But you refuse to &quot;put the past behind you.&quot; You dwell on what happened. You ask yourself: What does it mean? What does it tell me about myself? You realize that you don't really care for your job, that your true calling lies elsewhere. You resolve to make a fresh start, in a less profitable but more fulfilling endeavor. You have reached back in time to transform that slumbered hour into a wake-up call.</p>\n<p>Or you have an argument, lose your cool, and speak those unforgivable words. The next morning you're friends again, agreeing to &quot;forget what happened.&quot; But you don't forget. You're horrified by the degree of your insensitivity; you agonize over the distance that your words have placed between the two of you. Your horror and agony make you realize how sensitive you truly are to each other, how much you desire the closeness of the one you love. You have reached back in time to transform a source of distance and disharmony into a catalyst for greater intimacy and love.</p>\n<p>On the material surface of our lives, time's rule is absolute. But on its spiritual inside, the past is but another vista of life, open to exploration and development with the transformative power of teshuvah.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-business-proposal\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2610/jewish/A-Business-Proposal.htm\">A Business Proposal</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_toldot_annexes/#a-business-proposal\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n",

This word is translated into English by the word ‘emptiness’. The translation and the traditional interpretations create the impression that Nagarjuna declares the objects as empty or illusionary or not real or not existing. What is the assertion and concrete statement made by this interpretation? That nothing can be found, that there is nothing, that nothing exists? Was Nagarjuna denying the external world? Did he wish to refute that which evidently is? Did he want to call into question the world in which we live? Did he wish to deny the presence of things that somehow arise? My first point is the refutation of this traditional translation and interpretation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dependence</strong> or ‘relational view’.<br />\nHere I transcribe ‘<em>sunyata</em>’ by the word ‘dependence’. Now Nagarjuna’s central view can be named ‘dependence of things’. He is not looking for a material or immaterial object which can be declared as a fundamental reality of this world. His fundamental reality is not an object. It is a relation between objects. This is <strong>a relational view of reality</strong>. Reality is without foundation. Or: Reality has the wide open space as foundation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong></p>\n<p>What is happening between these two 'things'? This space, the gap, is not empty, nor filled with nothing. It is not the behaviour of bodies, but the behaviour of something between them may be essential for understanding the reality. This 'empty' space is full of energy. This space is the 'middle' between things. Things are going arm-in-arm. The middle might be considered as a force that bonds men to the world and it might be seen as a force of liberation. It might be seen as a bondage to the infinite space, or as participating in the existence of infinite space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>Nagarjuna, we are told, was a Buddhist philosopher. This statement is not wrong when we take the notion ‘philosophy’ in a deep sense as a love to wisdom, not as wisdom itself. Philosophy is a way to wisdom. Where this way has an end, wisdom begins and philosophy is no more necessary. A.N. Whitehead gives philosophy the commission of descriptive generalization. We do not need necessarily a philosophical building of universal dimensions. Some steps of descriptive generalization might be enough in order to see and understand reality.</p>\n<p>There is another criterion of Nagarjuna’s philosophy. Not his keywords ‘sunyata’ and ‘pratityasamutpada’ but his 25 philosophical examples are the heart of his philosophy. His examples are images. They do not speak to rational and conceptual understanding. They speak to our eyes. Images, metaphors, allegories or symbolic examples have a freshness which rational ideas do not possess. Buddhist dharma and philosophy is a philosophy of allegories. This kind of philosophy is not completely new and unknown to European philosophy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quantum Physics</strong></p>\n<p>European modes of thought had no idea of the space between two things. They were bound to the ideas of substance or subject, two main metaphysical traditions of European philosophical history, two main principles. These substances and these subjects are two immaterial bodies which were considered by traditional European metaphysics as lying, as a sort of core, inside the objects or underlying the empirical reality of our world.</p>\n<p>The first European scientist who saw the forces between two things had been Michael Faraday (1791-1867). Faraday was an English scientist who contributed to the fields of electromagnetism. Later physicists like Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg and others followed his view in modern physics.</p>\n<p>This is a fifth point of my work. I compare Nagarjuna with European scientific modes of thought for a better understanding of Asia. I do not compare Nagarjuna with European philosophers like Hegel, Heidegger, Wittgenstein. The principles and metaphysical foundations of physical sciences are more representative for European modes of thought than the ideas of Hegel, Heidegger and Wittgenstein and they are more precise. And slowly we are beginning to understand these principles.</p>\n<p>Let me take as an example the interpretation of quantum entanglement by the British mathematician Roger Penrose. Penrose discusses in the year of 2000 the experiences of quantum entanglement where light is separated over a distance of 100 kilometers and still remains connected in an unknown way. These are well known experiments in the last 30 years. Very strange for European modes of thought. The light should be either separated or connected. That is the expectation most European modes of thought tell us. Aristotle had been the first. He told us: Either a situation exists or not. There is not a third possibility.</p>\n<p>Now listen to Roger Penrose:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Quantum entanglement is a very strange type of thing. It is somewhere between objects being separate and being in communication with each other”<br />\n(Roger Penrose, <em>The Large, the Small and the Human Mind</em>, Cambridge University Press. 2000, p. 66).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sentence of Roger Penrose is a first step of a philosophical generalization in a Whiteheadian sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The metaphysical foundations of modern science</strong></p>\n<p>These foundations had been examined particularly by three European and American philosophers: E. A. Burtt, A.N. Whitehead and Hans-Georg Gadamer. I try to follow the approaches of these philosophers of anti-substantialism and relational thought. By ‘metaphysical foundations’ I do not understand transcendental ideas but simply the principles that are underlying sciences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>'<strong>Complementarity</strong>’, ‘<strong>interactions</strong>’, ‘<strong>entanglements</strong>’.<br />\nSince 1927 quantum physics has three key terms which give an indication to the fundamental physical reality: Complementarity, interactions and entanglement. These three notions are akin to Nagarjuna’s relational view of reality. They are akin and they are very precise, so that Buddhism might learn something from these descriptions and quantum physicists might learn from Nagarjuna’s examples and views of reality. They might learn to do a first step in a philosophical generalisation of quantum physical experiments. All of us we might learn how objects are entangled or going arm in arm.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"nagarjuna's-view-of-reality.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Nagarjuna's view of reality. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#nagarjuna's-view-of-reality.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Nagarjuna was the founder of the Middle Way School, <em>Madhyamaka</em>, which became fundamental to all Tibetan Buddhist traditions. It is a path of inner liberation which avoids the extreme views of own being or substantialism and subjectivism. In Nagarjuna's main work, <em>Mulamadhyamaka-karika</em> (MMK), the Middle Way is described as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What arises dependently (<em>pratityasamutpada</em>) is pronounced to be substancelessness (<em>sunyata</em>). This is nothing but a dependent concept (<em>prajnapti</em>). Substancelessness (<em>sunyata</em>) constitutes the middle way”.<br />\n[Mulamadhyamaka-karika: chapter 24, verse 18]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nagarjuna's view consists principally of two aspects. The first is an exposition of his view of reality (<em>sunyata</em>, <em>pratityasamutpada</em>), according to which reality has no firm core and does not consist of independent, substantial components. Reality is rather a system of two-bodies or many bodies which reciprocally affect each other<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup>. This view of reality is diametrically opposed to another key concept: ‘<em>svabhava</em>’, ‘own being’ or ‘inherent existence’, also known in the Greek tradition as ‘substance’.</p>\n<p>The second aspect of Nagarjuna’s philosophy is an answer to the inner contradictions of four extreme modes of thought which can be subsumed under the headings: ‘substantialism’, ‘subjectivism’, ‘holism’ and ‘instrumentalism’. My thesis is that these four modes of thought are unsustainable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"substantialism\" tabindex=\"-1\">Substantialism <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#substantialism\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p><em>Substance (or own being) is defined as something that has independent existence</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Substantialism is at the centre of traditional metaphysics. Substance is considered to exist by itself, i.e. the unchangeable, eternal and underlying basis for the entire non-material foundation of the world in which we live. Plato made a distinction between two forms of being: on the one hand, singular objects which exist<br />\nexclusively through participation without own being and, on the other hand, ideas that do have own being. Traditional metaphysics adopted Plato’s dualism.</p>\n<p>An independent own being is characterised as something that, as an existing thing, is</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>not dependent on anything else (Descartes);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>existing by itself and subsisting through itself (More);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>is completely unlimited by others and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>free from any kind of foreign command (Spinoza);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>exists of itself without anything else (Schelling).</p>\n<p>The highest substance was often understood as God.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since Kant's ‘Copernican Revolution’ the primary question of philosophy has no longer been to comprehend reality, but rather to fathom the mind, i.e. the source of perception and knowledge. For this reason traditional metaphysics has lost ground in the modern world. In fact its central concepts, such as ‘substance’, ‘reality’, ‘essence’ and ‘being’ have been replaced by the reductionist modes of thought of modern science. Now ‘atoms’, ‘elementary particles’, ‘energy’, ‘fields of force’ and other concepts derived from the ‘laws of nature’ are viewed as the fundamental ground.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subjectivism\" tabindex=\"-1\">Subjectivism <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#subjectivism\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p><em>Subjectivism is the philosophical theory that all knowledge is subjective, and relative</em>.</p>\n<p>According to René Descartes (1596-1650) consciousness is primarily existent and everything else is sheer content or form, a creation of consciousness. Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002) emphasises that subjectivity i.e. self-awareness has become the fulcrum of modern philosophical thought which provides us with evidential proof and certainty. This view has been continually brought into doubt by modern physical science. However, these doubts have not led to a new view of reality but to a fatal separation of philosophy and the sciences. This separation has exacerbated the dualism that preoccupies modern thought. Accordingly, the physicist P.C.W. Davies, expounds in his 1986 book that electrons, photons or atoms do not exist; they are nothing but models of thought.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"holism\" tabindex=\"-1\">Holism <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#holism\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p><em>Holism is “the view that an organic or integrated whole has a reality independent of and greater than the sum of its parts”</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The third approach avoids the fatal either-or dichotomy of the first two approaches by merging subject and object into one entity, such that there are no longer any separate parts but only one identity: all is one. ‘Wholeness’ is made absolute, is mystified and becomes an independent unity that exists without dependence on its parts. Wholeness is understood as something concrete as if it was a matter of fact or an object of experience. As a philosophical approach found in great periods of European history of philosophy, this view is connected with names like Thomas Aquinas (1224-1274), Leibniz (1646-1716) and Schelling (1775-1854). In quantum physics, holism is represented by David Bohm. His key concept is <em>‘holomovement’, an undivided wholeness in flowing movement</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\">[5]</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"instrumentalism\" tabindex=\"-1\">Instrumentalism <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#instrumentalism\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p><em>For instrumentalism, theories are not a description of the world but an instrument for a systematic classification and explanation of observations, and for the prediction of facts</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead of favouring subject or object or the two together, the fourth approach ignores the existence of the other three. According to this viewpoint the search for reality is insignificant and meaningless. Instrumentalism is quite modern, intelligent and sometimes hair-splitting and hypercritical. It is difficult to disengage from it. It is an extension of subjectivism and it regards the process of thinking as model making and as working with information, without concern as to what phenomena the information is about. What philosopher Donald Davidson (1917-2003) said about subjectivism, might be true for instrumentalism also: “Once one makes the decision for the Cartesian approach, it seems that one is unable to indicate what one’s proofs are evidence for”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The instrumentalist approach is outlined by the experimental physicist Anton Zeilinger who stated in an interview, “In classical physics we speak of a world of things that exists somewhere outside and we describe their nature. In quantum physics we have learned that we have to be very careful about this. Ultimately physical sciences are not sciences of nature but sciences of statements about nature. Nature in itself is always a construction of mind.

He writes in his <em>Yuktisastika</em> (YS): 19.[^11]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;That which has arisen dependently on this and that that has not arisen substantially (<em>svabhavatah</em>). What has not arisen substantially, how can it literally (<em>nama</em>) be called 'arisen'? […] That which originates due to a cause and does not abide without (certain) conditions but disappears when the conditions are absent, how can it be understood as 'to exist'?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the notions of ‘to arise’ and ‘to exist’, Nagarjuna does not mean the empirical existence but the substantial existence. When in many passages of MMK Nagarjuna states that things do not arise (MMK 7.29), that they do not exist (MMK 3.7, 5.8, 14.6), that they are not to be found (MMK 2.25, 9.11), that they are not (MMK 15.10), that they are unreal (MMK 13.1), then clearly this has the meaning: things do not arise substantially. They do not exist out of themselves; their independence cannot be found. They are dependent and in this sense they are substantially unreal.<br />\nNagarjuna only rejects the idea of a substantial arising of things which bear an absolute and independent existence. He does not refute the empirical existence of things as explained in the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;'It exists' implies grasping after eternity. It does not exist implies the philosophy of annihilation. Therefore, a discerning person should not decide on either existence or non-existence”. (MMK 15.10)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For Nagarjuna, the expression ‘to exist’ has the meaning of ‘to exist substantially’. His issue is not the empirical existence of things but the conception of a permanent thing i.e. the idea of an own being, without dependence on something else. Nagarjuna refutes the concept of independent existence which is unchangeable, eternal and existing by itself. Things do not arise out of themselves, they do not exist absolutely and are dependent. Their permanent being or existence cannot be found. The many interpretations of Nagarjuna which claim that he is also refuting the empirical existence of objects, are making an inadmissible generalization which moves Nagarjuna near to subjectivism, nihilism and instrumentalism. Such interpretations originate in metaphysical approaches which themselves have a difficulty in recognizing the empirical existence of the data presented. This is not at all the case with Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna presents the dependence of phenomena mainly in images as in the twenty-five chapters of the MMK.[^12]</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-brief-review-of-the-25-out-of-27-chapters-of-the-mulamadhyamakakarika-(mmk):\" tabindex=\"-1\">A brief review of the 25 out of 27 chapters of the <em>Mulamadhyamakakarika</em> (MMK): <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#a-brief-review-of-the-25-out-of-27-chapters-of-the-mulamadhyamakakarika-(mmk):\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A thing and its cause;</li>\n<li>A mover and the distance to be moved;</li>\n<li>A seer and a vision or view;</li>\n<li>A cause and its effect;</li>\n<li>A characteristic and its characterization;</li>\n<li>Desire and the desirous one;</li>\n<li>Origination, duration and decay;</li>\n<li>Action and agent;</li>\n<li>A viewer and a vision;</li>\n<li>Fire and fuel;</li>\n<li>Birth and death;</li>\n<li>Suffering and the causes of suffering;</li>\n<li>A teenager and an aged person;</li>\n<li>Something and a different thing;</li>\n<li>Being and nothing;</li>\n<li>Bondage and liberation;</li>\n<li>Action and its fruit;</li>\n<li>Identity and difference;</li>\n<li>The past, the present and the future;</li>\n<li>Cause and effect;</li>\n<li>Coming to be and passing away;</li>\n<li>The Buddha exists and the Buddha does not exist after death;</li>\n<li>Pure and impure;</li>\n<li>Buddha and <em>bodhi</em>;</li>\n<li><em>Nirvana</em> and being.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"chapter-1:-cause-and-effect.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Chapter 1: Cause and effect. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#chapter-1:-cause-and-effect.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>A high speed photograph by Harold E.

The do not clump and stick together. The most important characteristic of bodies is their interdependence and the resultant, substancelessness, the impossibility of existing individually and independently. This is the meaning of <em>pratityasamutpada</em> and <em>sunyata</em>: bodies (<em>dharma</em>) are without own being and are not independent of each other. Reality does not consist of single, isolated material or immaterial components. It is not the behaviour of independent bodies but the behaviour of something between them that is essential.</p>\n<p>Let us concentrate on the 25 chapters: a thing is not independent of its conditions, nor is it identical with them. A mover does not exist without the distance within which to move. The mover and the distance are not one. They do not adhere to one another and they do not agglomerate to form larger bodies (<em>dharma</em>). A viewer is not the same as the view, but a viewer without a view does not exist. There can be no cause without an effect, or an effect without a cause. The notion ‘cause’ has no meaning without the notion ‘effect’. Cause and effect are not one, but they cannot be separated into two independent notions either. Without a characteristic, we cannot speak of a character- ization, and the other way round. How could there be a desirous one without desire? When there is no action there is no agent, neither exists per se. Without fire there can be nothing designated as fuel.</p>\n<p>The material or immaterial components of a two-body or three-body system do not exist in isolation. They are not one and yet they are not independent of each other. Something is happening between these bodies and because of this they are not substantially real. For two or sometimes three complementary bodies or for two concepts like cause and effect, or bondage and liberation, the nature and the existence of each are dependent on the other. The one arises with the other and disappears with the other. This is why a thing doesn’t arises substantially, neither out of itself, nor out of another, nor out of both, nor without a cause. There is no fundamental core to reality; rather reality consists of systems of interacting bodies. This view of reality is first and foremost an idea; a pointer to reality which cannot be described in words. One who can speak about concept-free reality has not experienced it. For the Buddhist tradition based on Nagarjuna, the yogic experience of substancelessness, the experience of dependent arising, the direct perception of reality as it is, all presuppose a high level of spiritual realisation which entails the abandonment of extreme views and the demolition of the entire edifice of dualistic thought and philosophy. To experience <em>pratityasamutpada</em> or <em>sunyata</em> means to become free of all entanglements of this world. <em>Nirvana</em> is simply another expression for this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"discussion-of-nagarjuna's-work.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Discussion of Nagarjuna’s work. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#discussion-of-nagarjuna's-work.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>For Nagarjuna, the primary question was not about mind, nor about the origin of knowledge but about the reality of the physical world we are living in. Tarab Tulku Rinpoche presented an all encompassing position when he said:[^13]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“everything existing partakes in a fundamental 'mind-field', which is the basic 'substance' from which mind in a more individual way and the individual body develop”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to emphasise that Nagarjuna does not only speak about views without substance but also about bodies (<em>dharma</em>) without substance, here is a comparison with the views of reality suggested by quantum physicists. This is the reason for the title of this Essay: “<em>Eastern and Western Modes of Thought</em>”. In order to understand Eastern modes of thought we should try to see our own modes of thought, our own traditional preconditions. In the modern Western world we have our own preconditions to see the modes of thought of Asia. We cannot deny this. We should not minimise the importance of our own modes of thought when we give an interpretation of Nagarjuna’s philosophy. I try to understand Nagarjuna’s philosophy from a view of ‘interaction’ and entanglement’ in modern physics or the behaviour of something between bodies (Albert Einstein). I try to understand modern physics from Nagarjuna’s view of ‘dependence of things’. Among these physical notions, there is not one that directly engages the principle of ‘<em>sunyata</em>’ or ‘<em>pratityasamutpada</em>’. A notion such as ‘entanglement’ is not the same. It is akin to ‘<em>sunyata</em>’ or ‘<em>pratityasamutpada</em>’. It has similar qualities. There are many notions in the history of European philosophy which try to express that what bounds one object to one another. The philosopher A.N. Whitehead mentions more than 20 different notions to express his idea of the prehension (the act of seizing or grasping) or the connection or the relation of things. (Attachment, solidarity, relatedness, structural connection, cooperation, interaction, the networking of systems and many others.) We read in Whitehead’s <em>Adventures of Ideas</em>, an explanation for the great variety of the terms:</p>\n<pre><code>“Finally civilized language provides a whole group of words, each embodying the general idea under its own specialization. If we desire to reach the generality common to these various specializations, we must gather together the whole group of words with the hope of discerning their common element. This is a necessary procedure for the purpose of philosophical generalization. The premature use of one familiar word inevitably limits the required generalization by importing the familiar special connotation of that word”.\n\n(A.N. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, Free Press, New York 1967, p. 236)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Physics is about views and the conditions of physical reality. It creates models and thus examines only realities which have been posited by physics itself. Nevertheless, as the experimental psychologist Irvin Rock, who studied visual perception, describes it, we should not go so far as to consider all our perceptions and thought models to be purely adventitious. While the constructions of our mind are not identical with reality, they are not purely coincidental and usually not deceptive.[^14] Behind these models are empirical<br />\nbodies and there is some approximation of a structural similarity between a physical model and the corresponding physical and tangible reality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quantum-physics\" tabindex=\"-1\">Quantum Physics <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#quantum-physics\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"the-metaphysical-foundations-of-quantum-physics\" tabindex=\"-1\">The metaphysical foundations of quantum physics <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#the-metaphysical-foundations-of-quantum-physics\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is not a presentation or criticism of quantum physics but a discussion of the metaphysical views and principles which underlie quantum physics. The views of reality in quantum physics can be expressed by three key terms: ‘complementarity’, ‘four interactions’ and ‘entanglement’.[^15] In the prehistory of quantum physics it could not be proved experimentally whether the smallest elements of light were particles or waves. Many experiments argued in favour of one or the other assumption. Electrons and photons sometimes act like waves and sometimes like particles. This ‘behaviour’ was named: wave- particle dualism. The idea of dualism was therein understood to be a logical contradiction, in the sense that only one or the other could actually apply; but paradoxically both appeared.</p>\n<p>According to this understanding of traditional atomic theory, electrons and photons cannot be both particles and waves. According to atomic theory, a scientific explanation consists of a reduction of a variable factor into its permanent components and their applicable mathematical laws. This is the fundamental dualistic view that modern atomic theory has inherited from the natural philosophy of the ancient Greeks who expounded that substance and permanence cannot be found in objects of perception of the world in which we live, but can be found in the fundamental elements making up objects and their mathematical order. These material and immaterial foundations hold the world together, they do not change, although everything else changes.</p>\n<p>According to the expectation of traditional atomic theory, it should be possible to reduce an object to its <em>independent</em> elements, to its mathematical laws, or to its simple and fundamental principles. Until 1927 the fundamental elements had to be either particles or waves, they could not be both. What is to be understood by independent elements? As mentioned before, the notion of substance refers to something that has _independent__ existence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"albert-einstein's-contribution-to-the-interpretation-of-quantum-physics.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Albert Einstein’s contribution to the interpretation of quantum physics. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#albert-einstein's-contribution-to-the-interpretation-of-quantum-physics.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Albert Einstein was following the aforementioned metaphysical tradition when he wrote in the year of 1948 very clearly:[^16]</p>\n<pre><code>“For the classification of things that are introduced in physics, it is essential that these things have for a certain time an independent existence from each other, in so far as these things lie 'in different parts of space'. Without the assumption of such an independent existence [Einstein uses the German term _So-sein_, this is akin to terms like substance, or being, or suchness] of things which, in terms of ordinary thought, are spatially distant from each other, physical thought in the usual sense would not be possible”.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This idea of an independent reality was projected onto the basic element of the world of matter by atomic theory. For atomic theory, a scientific explanation means to reduce the variability and variety of objects and conditions to their permanent, stable, independent, and indivisible elements and to their conformity with mathematical laws.</p>\n<p>According to the expectations of traditional atomic theory, all variations in nature can be explained in terms of separation, association and movements of unchanging, independent atoms or still more elementary particles. These particles and their conformity to mathematical laws constitute the core of bodies. They underlie everything and hold the world together. The question whether the fundamental objects are waves or particles was an explosive issue: at stake were the traditional metaphysical views of reality available to quantum physics.</p>\n<p>It became evident that fundamental reality could not be grasped by traditional views of reality. What is the explanatory value of traditional atomic theory based on Democritus, if it becomes clear that there are no independent, stable atoms or elementary particles, and that objects have no stable core? Are these quantum objects objective, subjective, both or neither? What is reality? Is the quantum world completely distinct from the world in which we live?</p>\n<h3 id=\"niels-bohr's-contribution-to-the-interpretation-of-quantum-physics.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Niels Bohr’s contribution to the interpretation of quantum physics. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#niels-bohr's-contribution-to-the-interpretation-of-quantum-physics.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In 1927, the physicist Niels Bohr introduced the idea of <strong>complementarity</strong> into quantum physics. According to this idea, the wave form and the particle form are not two separate forms which contradict and exclude each other but are mutually complementary forms which can provide a complete description of physical manifestations only together. According to Niels Bohr, complementarity means that in the quantum world it is impossible to speak about independent quantum objects because they are in an interactive relationship with each other as well as with the instrument of measurement. He emphasized that this interaction between the quantum object and the instrument of measurement was an inseparable element of quantum objects, because it plays a major part in the development of several features of them. Certain measurements establish electrons or photons as particles and destroy the interference that distinguishes the object as a wave. Other measurements establish the object as a wave. This was Niels Bohr's new idea of reality. From the insight that the quantum object and the instrument of measurement could not be separated, Niels Bohr did not conclude that there are no quantum objects. At least he did not do so when he was arguing in terms of physics. When he spoke about the metaphysics of quantum physics he took an instrumentalist approach.</p>\n<p>For the physicist Niels Bohr, quantum physical objects consist of interacting and complementary quantum objects.[^17]</p>\n<p><strong>The double-slit experiment</strong>.<br />\n<img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/nagarjuna/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics-52_1.jpg\" alt=\"The double-slit experiment\" /></p>\n<p>If you send an atom of helium trough a double-slit, every atom produces a point behind the double-slit. The atoms arrive in discrete lumps. There is no interference in the beginning. The atoms arrive like bullets at the screen. But later they show interference. Their appearance shows the structure of waves in a similar manner to waves on water. The seven pictures shown were taken at intervals ranging from 5 minutes to 42 hours and 18 minutes. Quantum objects show a double quality of particles and of waves. They are dependent on the instrument of measurement: the double slit. This double quality has been named ‘complementarity’ by Niels Bohr.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/nagarjuna/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics-53_1.jpg\" alt=\"Quelle: leifi.physik.uni-muenchen.de/web_ph07_g8/umwe\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Dipole.</strong><br />\n(Haken, H./Wolf, H.C., Atom und Quantenphysik.

These four forces obstruct the reduction of quantum objects into independent objects. Such an idea had already been posited by Democritus (460? - 370? BCE). These interactional forces which operate between the quantum objects, are added to the quantum objects. Instead of singular, independent objects, two-body systems or many-body systems were established as the base of matter. Between the bodies, interacting forces are effective in keeping them together.[^18]</p>\n<p>These interactions are a composite of the bodies. Mostly they are forces of attraction and in the case of electro-magnetic forces they can also be forces of repulsion. One visualises the interaction between the elementary particles as an interaction of elementary particles. The physicist Steven Weinberg puts it like this:[^19]</p>\n<pre><code>“At the present moment the closest we can come to a unified view of nature is a description in terms of elementary particles and their mutual interactions. [...] The most familiar are gravitation and electromagnetism, which, because of their long range, are experienced in the everyday world. Gravity holds our feet on the ground and the planets in their orbits. Electromagnetic interactions of electrons and atomic nuclei are responsible for all the familiar chemical and physical properties of ordinary solids, liquids and gases. Next, both in range and familiarity, are the 'strong' interactions, which hold protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus. The strong forces are limited in range to about 10-13 centimetre and so are quite insignificant in ordinary life, or even in the scale (10-8 centimetre) of the atom. Least familiar are the 'weak' interactions. They are of such short range (less than 10-15 centimetre) and are so weak that they do not seem to play a role in holding anything together”.\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this respect, the explanations enter into quite difficult and subtle particulars. How, for example, can an electron which consists only of one particle be in interaction with another quantum object? What part of itself can it emit if it consists only of one particle? These questions can be answered by the concept of interaction. In fact an electron does not exist of only a single particle exactly because the interaction of the electron is a part of it. In 1978 The physicists Daniel Z. Freedman and Pieter van Nieuwenhuizen wrote in this regard that:[^20]</p>\n<pre><code>“the observed electron mass is the sum of the 'bare mass' and the 'self-energy' resulting from the interaction of the electron with its own electromagnetic field. Only the sum of  the two terms is observable”.\n</code></pre>\n<p>What in quantum physics is known about interactions is here summarized in the words of the physicist and Nobel prize laureate Gerard 't Hooft:[^21]</p>\n<pre><code>“An electron is surrounded by a cloud of virtual particles, which it continually emits and absorbs. This cloud does not consist of photons only, but also of pairs of charged particles, for example electrons and their anti-particles, the positrons. […] Even a quark is surrounded by a cloud of gluons and pairs of quark and anti-quark”.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Singular, isolated, independent quarks, a phenomenon which is called<br />\n‘confinement’ in recent research, have never been observed. Quarks are<br />\ncaptives, they cannot appear on their own but only as one of a pair or as one of a trio. When you try to separate two quarks by force, new quarks will appear between them which combine into pairs and trios. Claudio Rebbi and other physicists have reported that,[^22]</p>\n<pre><code>“between the quarks and gluons inside an elementary particle, additional quarks and gluons are continuously formed and after a short time again subside”.\n</code></pre>\n<p>These clouds of virtual particles represent or produce interactions. The central core of quantum physics consists of a new view of reality that no longer perceives singular, independent elements but rather two-body systems, two states of a quantum object or two concepts, e.g., earth/moon, proton/electron, proton/neutron, quark/anti-quark, wave/measuring instrument, particle/measuring instrument, twin photons, super-positions, spin-up/spin-down, matter/anti-matter, elementary particle/field of force, law of nature/matter, etcetera.</p>\n<p>These systems cannot be separated into independent parts, or reduced to two separate, independent bodies or states, nor is one fundamental and the other derived, as the metaphysical either-or schemes of substantialism and subjectivism try to establish. They are not joined into a seamless unity either, they are not the same, they are not identical and they are not a mysterious wholeness as holism indicates.</p>\n<p>Finally, we cannot claim, as instrumentalists do, that they are nothing but mathematical models which we have constructed and which do not correspond to physical reality. In physics, there is a fundamental reality that is not a one-body system. It is a two-body system or an assembly of bodies, a cloud of virtual particles which surround the<br />\ncentral or 'naked' body. Between these bodies is an interaction that is one of the composites of them.</p>\n<p>This understanding of physics cannot be dislodged and yet all our metaphysical schemata struggle against it. The cloud does not conform to our traditional expectations of what should delineate and underpin stability, substantiality and order. How can clouds be what we are used to calling the basic elements of matter? How can this small vibrating something be what generations of philosophers and physicists have been searching for in order to arrive at the core of matter, the ultimate reality? Is this supposed to be it?</p>\n<p>From these little clouds we attempt to use metaphysical interpretation to distil something that has substance and is enduring. Entirely within the sense of the substance metaphysics of Plato, Heisenberg (1901-1976) contends that the mathematical forms are the idea of elementary particles and that the object of elementary particles corresponds with this mathematical idea. The physicist and philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker (1912-2007) called mathematics 'the<br />\nessence of nature'. According to the physicist Schopper, fields of force are the ultimate reality.[^23] Some of us want to see reality as a mysterious whole (holism) or dismiss it as a construction without any correspondence to empirical reality (instrumentalism). All of this only because we do not find it easy to admit that the complex interactions of the world in which we live have their roots in a reality that is in itself complex.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to escape from the entanglement of this world in quantum physics and, to find an elementary quantum object that is not dependent on other quantum objects or on parts of itself. It is also impossible to dissolve the double-sided character of quantum objects. The fundamental reality of our physical world consists of clouds of interacting quantum objects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#conclusion.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It seems that reality is not static, solid or independent and does not consist of singular, isolated material or immaterial factors, but of systems of dependent bodies. Most systems consist of more than two bodies, but there is no system that consists of less than two bodies. In quantum physics we call such fundamental two-body systems: earth/moon, electron/positron, quark/anti-quark, particle/field, etcetera. Nagarjuna calls his systems or dependent pairs: mover/distance to move within, fire/fuel, agent/action, viewer/view, etcetera.</p>\n<p>Both, quantum physicists and Nagarjuna deal with two-body systems or two entities which have bodies that are neither properly separate, nor properly joined together. They do not unite into one, nor do they fall apart. These bodies are not independent and cannot be observed singly because in their very existence and constitution they are dependent on each other and cannot exist or function independently.</p>\n<p>They are entangled by interactions, even at a far distance. One of them cannot be reduced to the other and it is not possible to explain one of them on the basis of the other. The resultant systems have a fragile stability, the components of which are maintained by interactions and mutual dependencies which are sometimes known, sometimes not fully known and sometimes totally unknown (for example as with entangled twin photons).</p>\n<p>What is reality? We have become accustomed to believe in a firm ground under our feet and fleeting clouds above in the sky. The view of reality in Nagarjuna's thought and the ideas of complementarity, interactions and entanglement of quantum physics teach us that everything is built on sand. Moreover, even the grains of sand are not endowed with a solid nucleus. Their stability is based on balancing unstable interactions of their components.</p>\n<h2 id=\"appendices\" tabindex=\"-1\">Appendices <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#appendices\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"appendix-1:-meanings-of-pratityasamutpada.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Appendix 1: Meanings of pratityasamutpada. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#appendix-1:-meanings-of-pratityasamutpada.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In the first place <em>pratityasamutpada</em> is an indication of dependence. Dependent bodies are in an intermediate state - they are not properly separated and they are not one entity. Secondly, they rely on each other and are influenced or determined by something else. Thirdly, their behaviour is influenced by something in-between, for example a mover is attracted by gravitational force, a viewer is dependent on rays of light between his eyes and the object, a piano player’s action is determined by the fine motor skills of his fingers, an agent is dependent on his act. <em>Pratityasamutpada</em> is an indication of dependence and of something that happens between the objects. One object is bound to the other without being identical to it. The implicit interpretations of pratityasamutpada, are in terms of time, structure and space.</p>\n<p>The following citations and references illustrate the term <em>pratityasamutpada</em>. <em>Pratityasamutpada</em> is used:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>as Dependence in Nagarjuna’s Hymn to the Buddha:[^24]</p>\n<p>“Dialecticians maintain that suffering is created by itself, created by (someone) else, created by both (or) without a cause, but You have stated that it is dependently born”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>as an intermediate state by Nagarjuna:</p>\n<p>“Objects are neither together nor separated” (Nagarjuna, MMK 6. 10).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>as bondage in the <em>Hevajra Tantra</em>:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<p>“Men are bound by the bondage of existence and are liberated by understanding the nature of existence”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>as an intermediate state by Roger Penrose:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<p>“Quantum entanglement is a very strange type of thing.

The interval that runs between one idea and another, one thing and another, is infinite, and can only be surpassed by the creative act. This is why the dynamic moment and dialectic concept of the mean are no less mysterious than those of the beginning and the end. The mean is a union of two diverse and opposite things in a unity. It is an essentially dialectic concept, and involves an apparent contradiction, namely, the identity of the one and the many, of the same and the diverse. This unity is simple and composite; it is unity and synthesis and harmony. It shares in two extremes without being one or the other. It is the continuum, and therefore the infinite. Now, the infinite identically uniting contraries, clarifies the nature of the interval. In motion, in time, in space, in concepts, the discrete is easy to grasp, because it is finite. The continuum and the interval are mysterious, because they are infinite”.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"appendix-2:-what-is-quantum-entanglement\" tabindex=\"-1\">Appendix 2: What is quantum entanglement? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#appendix-2:-what-is-quantum-entanglement\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Two very short answers:</p>\n<p>According to Clegg:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\">[12]</a></sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>  “Entanglement is a strange feature of quantum physics, the science of the very small. It’s possible to link together two quantum particles — photons of light or atoms, for example — in a special way that makes them effectively two parts of the same entity. You can then separate them as far as you like, and a change in one is instantly reflected in the other. This odd, faster than light link, is a fundamental aspect of quantum science. Schrödinger, who came up with the name ‘entanglement’ called it ‘the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics’.

Each stone is conceived as fully describable apart from any reference to any other portion of matter. It might be alone in the universe, the sole occupant of uniform space. But it would still be that stone which it is. Also the stone could be adequately described without any reference to past or future. It is to be conceived fully and adequately as wholly constituted within the present moment. This is the full Newtonian concept, which bit by bit was given away, or dissolved, by the advance of modern physics. It is the thorough-going doctrine of ‘simple location’ and of ‘external relations’. There was some divergence of opinion as to the external relations. Newton himself was inclined to construe them in terms of shock and stress between contiguous bodies. But his immediate followers, such as Roger Cotes, added the notion of force at a distance. But either alternative was wholly and completely a fact of that external relation between two bits of matter either contiguous or distant. (…) We have to discover a doctrine of nature which expresses the concrete relatedness of physical functionings, of the past with the present, and also expresses the concrete composition of physical realities which are individually diverse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Modern physics has abandoned the doctrine of Simple Location. The physical things which we term stars, planets, lumps of matter, molecules, electrons, protons, quanta of energy, are each to be conceived as modifications of conditions within space-time, extending throughout its whole range. There is a focal region, which in common speech is where the thing is. But its influence streams away from it with finite velocity throughout the utmost recess of space and time”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(A.N.

These concepts are all free inventions. They led to the formulation of the mechanical point of view. For the physicists of the early nineteenth century, the reality of our outer world consisted of particles with simple forces acting between them and depending only on the distance. He tried to retain as long as possible his belief that he would succeed in explaining all events in nature by these fundamental concepts of reality. The difficulties connected with the deflection of the magnetic needle, the difficulties connected with the structure of the ether, induced us to create a more subtle reality. The important invention of the electromagnetic field appears. A courageous scientific imagination was needed to realize fully that not the behaviour of bodies, but the behaviour of something between them, that is, the field, may be essential for ordering and understanding events” ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What impresses our senses as matter is really a great <code>concentration</code> of energy into a comparatively small space”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Albert Einstein, Leopold Infield, <em>The Evolution of Physics</em>.

      "title": "Dear Rav Green",
      "content_html": "<p>Dear Rav Green,</p>\n<p>I do not know if you remember me, but I have attended a number of services and other events at the Constantia Shul, often accompanied by Steve Jacobs. I have been living in the Eastern Cape, in the beautiful Amatola Mountains for the past 6 years. We used to have a functioning community in East London, but about 2 years ago they had a serious conflict with the Rabbi, and since then, the community has, may I be so bold as to say, been mal-functioning.</p>\n<p>What I am reaching out to you regarding, is that I have been trying to collect my writings over the years, and many of them pertain to thoughts I have had (and continue to have), some of which are quite eclectic. As a result of which I have no idea if they are true (on target) or not - and that is what I need guidance with. I have to confess that I have been a student of Kabbalah for many years, and have studied with a number of different teachers, especially while I was in the States. My last teacher was Rabbi Seltzer, here in SA.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I need help with is that as I have been on my own for so long, fairly isolated (especially since lockdown) in the small hamlet of Hogsback that we live in that my practice has been waning. After completing my schooling in SA, I made Aliyah, and spent the next 13 years in Israel before ending up in the States. I loved being in Israel because I felt that the Judaism I had spent all my life up to that point wrestling with finally made sense. In Israel it was a lived experience, whereas often I have felt as if it was an overlay - even if an excellent one. You must remember that there is much confusion for a young South African Jew as the seasons of the festivals are all wrong. it is not an easy thing to reconcile, so it inspires some deep questioning of the universality of some of the embedded constructs. It might have inspired me to spend a large part of my life trying to translate the depths that I could swim in to the modern vernacular. The Source that anything speaks of is unchanging. It is only us that can change, and with that change must come different words, or new ways to hear old words. And anything that does not, or will not, change - except for the Unchanging - is dead.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, my request is to ask for any advice or guidance you may be able to give me. What I feel I need is a mentor of some nature, and someone with whom I can speak with who can guide me at this stage of my journey.</p>\n<p>I hope this will not be seen as a strange request, but you are the only Rabbi that I feel I could reach out and ask at this point. If there is someone else who you can suggest who might be more able to help me, I would be very happy to go in the direction that you point me.</p>\n",

Then as the it grew legs and a head, and became the <em>Chet</em>. But, upon the <em>Yud</em> manifesting, there was a space of not-<em>Yud</em>, that had to be as well. So the <em>heh</em> has the not-<em>Yud</em>, while the <em>yud</em>, has hidden in the <em>Chet</em>. Now, when I refer to a space of not-<em>Yud</em>, it is the complimentary opposite, which is also known as a portal. By engaging/entangling (entering the space of) the not-<em>yud</em>, you can &quot;track/trace&quot; the <em>Yud</em>. You could say you enter through the not-<em>Yud</em>, and exit through the <em>Yud</em>, which is the same place. The mystery here is that only by contemplating the space of the not-<em>yud</em>, you can find the <em>Yud</em>, which is right there all the time. The mystery continues, because it is not the <em>Chet</em>, which is the representation of this, but the <em>Heh</em>, which is &quot;missing&quot; the <em>Yud</em>. But the real <em>Yud</em>, the one we are referring to here, is &quot;hidden&quot;, or cannot be seen with our eyes, so it appears as an invisible <em>Yud</em>, one that only those with the right eyes can see, and know that it is the portal to the <em>Yud</em> realm - but has to be approached from the non-<em>Yud</em> space. (Am i mad?) ]<br />\ndifference between <em>Chet</em> and <em>Bet</em> is the <em>bet</em> is open to the future, while <em>chet</em> is only open below. Thus, the mystery of the <em>Chet</em> is not to &quot;fall&quot; down, but to rise up to the ceiling, and open the <em>Yud</em> portal at the top (left/feminine).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus Vav could also be looked at as an ascent (or portal)</p>\n<h2 id=\"beliefs-and-opinions-(cont)\" tabindex=\"-1\">Beliefs &amp; Opinions (cont) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/beliefs_opinions/#beliefs-and-opinions-(cont)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Faith: Single commandment = descent along the <em>Vav</em></li>\n<li>All 613 happen right now for each and every one of us</li>\n<li>All we need is faith + His 613 commandments to create the vessel/chariot/<em>merkaba</em></li>\n<li><em>Merkaba</em>: metatron - the &quot;root&quot; particle design from the spiritual world.

Which is the descent and flow of the Light, or life force, from the upper planes to the lower by a series of contractions. This density continues to occur until it reaches a density that is sufficient for manifest life to appear.</p>\n<p>Yet there seems to be a critical threshold beyond which it begins to affect the life<br />\nnegatively, and enters into a realm which we call <em>Sitra Ahara</em>, the Other. This &quot;threshold&quot; could be identified by the &quot;Light becoming Dark&quot;, which means that it is less. And that would make sense - as the Light travels further and further from the source, it will get less. This densification of the Light is called <em>kelipot</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, we have a problem, if this Light was the Light of the Creator, it would fill everything, and so how could there be Darkness? Well, in the beginning the Light was supernal, which means it was pure and simple - no darkness, no shadows. Then He &quot;split&quot; the Light, made them essentially male and female - light and dark. This is the fundamental beginning of Creation. It does not begin with Aleph, but with Bet. There can be no story, no drama, no dance, unless there are you have someone to tell the story, or play out the drama with and we spend much of our life seeking that dance partner.</p>\n<p>We receive light from the Divine Word and Breath (&quot;breathed into his nostrils&quot;), concealed from us, by the Divine Will, and the densification which is our birthright.<br />\nThis densification is an expression of the downward thrust of the <em>Tzimtzum</em> towards the centre - which is where Adonai sits.</p>\n",

Why and how could they obey them, if there, for instance, was no Temple? How could they keep the Laws of Kashrut if they were receiving manna from heaven, that would be by its very nature, kosher? They had no need for work, as they had food and their clothes needed no mending. I wonder if there tents and other materials did.</li>\n<li>In a sense the laws were given to a generation who were unable to practice them!</li>\n<li>What did the livestock eat during these wanderings in the desert? They were not able to grow, nor harvest grains. Nor did they have need for them - except as animal food. Also the livestock must have increased significantly if no-one was eating the meat. And why would the people not eat some of their livestock, at least, if there were getting bored of eating the magical manna?</li>\n<li>During that period, they must have lost a significant amount of useful skills, as besides having no need of them, they would not have time to set up shop, and teach their children any of their skills. So the bricklayes, and potmakers, the leatherworkers, and blacksmiths... all were gone!</li>\n<li>Thus the generation that entered would know little of such arts. If you think this is unlikely. That knowledge of that nature is not lost in a generation, just look at our children. Children that no longer read books, or know how to do arithmetic, etc. Within one generation think of the skills that have been lost, especially in the move from one technology to another. Try and find a skilled mason today. If we ever need to use horse and cart for our main source of transport, we will be in serious trouble, as there are not enough people who know who to make the leather bridles and saddles, etc that will be needed.</li>\n<li></li>\n<li>There is no mention of water here either...</li>\n</ul>\n",

href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#footnotes\">Footnotes:</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is just a partial compendium of alchemical works. I liked the sacred manner in which they approached and dealt with this exploration of natural and chemical reactions. It seems to me that we have lost wisdom in our much more &quot;secular&quot; approach. To have dragged the wonders of the world in which we exist down to the mud and grime of our earthly existence, acknowledging nothing higher or greater than human endeavour, human imagination, human creativity and the great human power over nature - is an abomination.</p>\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/alc/index.htm\">full list</a>. But there is plenty to chew on in this selection.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mary-the-prophetess\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mary the Prophetess <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#mary-the-prophetess\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<h2 id=\"the-practise-of-mary-the-prophetess-in-the-alchemical-art.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The practise of Mary the Prophetess in the Alchemical Art. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-practise-of-mary-the-prophetess-in-the-alchemical-art.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>One day Aros the Philosopher had a meeting with Mary. After paying her respects, he said to her: &quot;Oh great Prophetess, I have hear that you are able to whiten the Stone in one day.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes, Aros, even in a part of one day&quot;</p>\n<p>Aros was surprised, because this was unheard of. &quot;When can such a thing be done? How will we whiten and afterwards add blackness?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;O Aros, many nations have difficulty with this. But do you not know that there is a water or thing that whiten <strong>Hendragem</strong>?</p>\n<p>Aros answer her, &quot;O Lady it is so as you say, but in a long time.&quot;</p>\n<p>Mary continued, &quot;Hermes in all his Books has said that the Philosophers whiten the Stone in one hour of the day.&quot;</p>\n<p>Aros said&quot; to her, &quot;Oh how excellent is that?&quot;</p>\n<p>Mary said, &quot;It is most excellent to him that is ignorant of it.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;There are all the four Elements. He [Hermes] said that their fumes might be completed, and complexioned, and coagulated, and retained in one day, until they fullfill the consequence (i.e. attain the end),&quot; Aros began.</p>\n<p>&quot;O Aros, by God, if your senses or understanding were not solid, you should not hear these words from me, until the Lord should fill my Heart with the grace of His divine Will. Nevertheless take the <strong>Allum of Spain</strong>, the white gum and the red gum, which is the <em>Kibric of the Philosophers</em>, and their <em>Sol</em> and the <em>greater Tincture</em>, and marry <em>Gum</em> with Gum togeather with a true Matrimony. Make them like a running Water, and vitrify this water which has been laboured or wrought upon for one day, out of the two <em>Lubechs</em>, upon the fixed body, and liquefy them by the secret of Nature in the Vessel of Philosophy. Did you understand us?&quot; Maria explained.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes Lady.&quot;</p>\n<p>Mary said, &quot;Keep the <em>fume</em> and take care that none of it fly away. Let your measure be with a gentle fire such as is the Measure of the heat of the Sun in the Month of June or July, and stay by your Vessel and behold it with care how it grows black, grows red, and grows white in less than three hours of the day, and the fume will penetrate the body, and the Spirit will be bound up, and they will be like milk, incerating, and liquefying and penetrating: and that is the secret.&quot;</p>\n<p>Aros was confused, &quot;This does not always happen...&quot;</p>\n<p>Mary said to him, &quot;Aros, and there is more wonder concerning this, that it was not among the Ancients, nor did it come to him by curing, or by the Medicinal Art and that is to take the white, clear and honoured Herb growing on the Hillocks, and pound it fresh as it is in its Hour, and that is the true Body not flying from the Fire.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Is it the Stone of Truth?&quot; He asked</p>\n<p>And Mary said, Yes&quot;. But men do not know this regimen (rule or way of working) with the speediness thereof.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;And what happends after?&quot; asked Aros.</p>\n<p>Mary said, &quot;Vitrify upon it <em>Kibric</em> or <em>Zibeic</em> and there are the two fumes comprehending the two Lights, and project upon that the complement of the <em>Tinctures of the Spirits</em>, and the <em>weights of Truth</em>, and pound it all, and put it to the Fire, and you shall see wonderfull things from them. The whole government consists in the <em>temper of the Fire</em>. How strange it is, how it will be moved from one colour to another, in less than an hour of the Day, until it arrives at the mark of redness and whiteness. Then cast away the Fire and permit it to cool, and open it and you will find the clear pearly Body to be of the <em>Colour of the Poppy of the Wood</em> mixed with whiteness and that is it which is incerating, liquefying and penetrating, and one golden piece thereof, the weight of a small golden Coin, falls upon a thousand thousand and two hundred thousand. That is the hidden secret.&quot;</p>\n<p>Then Aros fell down upon his face.</p>\n<p>Mary said to him, &quot;Lift up your head, Aros, because I will shorten for you the thing, as that clear body which is thrown upon the Hillocks, and is not obtained by putrefaction or motion. Take and pound it with <em>Gum Elsaron</em>, and with the two fumes because the Body comprehending or retaining them is Gumm Elsaron and grind it all. Therefore approach because it all melts. If you project its wife upon it, it will be as a distilling Water, and when the Aire shall strike it, it will become congealed and be one body. Make projection of it, and you will behold Wonders. That, O Aros, is the hidden secret of <em>Scholia</em>; and know that the said two fumes are the Root of this Art, and they are the white <em>Kibric</em> and the humid <em>calx</em>, but the fixed Body is of the Heart of Saturn comprehending the Tincture, and the Fields of Wisdom or of Scholia. The Philosophers have named it by many and all names. Received or gathered from the Hillocks, it is a clear white Body. These are the medicine of this Art, part is procured and part is found upon the Hillocks. Know Aros that the wise men have not called it the Fields of Wisdom, or of <em>Scholia</em>, unless because <em>Scholia</em> will not be compleated but by it; and in the Scholia there are nothing but wonderfull things. For there also enters into them the four Stones, and its true regimen is as I have said. And that is first <em>Scoyare</em>, <em>Ade</em>, and <em>Zethet</em>; by that make your Allegory as Hermes has done in his Books <em>Scoyas</em>, and the Philosophers have always made the regimen longer, and have resembled the work to every thing which ought not to make the work, and they make the Magistery to be in one year, and this but only for hiding it from the ignorant people, until it be confirmed in their Hearts and their senses (till they believe the Art),: because the Art will not be completed except only in Gold; because it is the great secret of God: and they who hear of our secrets do not verify them (nor believe them to be true), by reason of their ignorance.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Did you understand Aros?&quot;</p>\n<p>Aros said, &quot;Yes. But tell me about that vessel, without which the Work will not be accomplished.</p>\n<p>Mary answered, &quot;It is the Vessel of Hermes which the Stoicks have concealed, and it is not a Necromanticall Vessel, but it is the Measure of your Fire.&quot;</p>\n<p>Aros said, &quot;O Lady, you have been a scholar in the Society of Scoyari, have you found among the Secrets of the Philosophers, which they have set down in their Books, that any one can make the Art out of one Body?&quot;</p>\n<p>And Mary said: &quot;Yes, which Hermes has not taught, because the <em>Root of Scholia</em> is a body which cannot be made smooth or plain and incurable (unconquerable) and it is a poison mortifying all bodies, and it pulverises them and coagulates Mercury with its odour.&quot; Continuing, she said, &quot;I swear to you by the eternal God, that that poison when it is dissolved until it is made a subtle Water - I care not by what dissolution it is done - does coagulate Mercury into Luna with the strength of Truth, and it falls into the Throne of Jupiter, and forms him into Luna. The Science is in all Bodies, but the Stoics, by reason of the shortness of their lives, and the Length of the Work, have concealed this; and they found out these tinging Elements, and they increased them, and all the Philosophers teach them, except the Vessel of Hermes, because it is divine, and of the Wisdom of the Lord hidden from Nations: and they who are ignorant of it, know not the Regimen of Truth, because of their Ignorance of the Vessel of Hermes.&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>Mary briefly soundeth forth\nStrange things like Thunder round the Earth.\nShe with two Gumms makes the Bottom stay\nWhat else would fly away.\nThree things if you three hours attend\nAre chained together in the End.\nMary the Light of dew, and Art has got\nIn three hours to tie the Knot.\nPluto's daughter, it is she\nWho binds Loves confederacy\nJoined with three seeds she does aspire\nTo be exalted in the Fire.\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"on-the-philadelphian-gold\" tabindex=\"-1\">On the Philadelphian Gold <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#on-the-philadelphian-gold\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Conference betwixt Philochrysus and Philadelphus</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Philochrysus: This was upon me to ask you. You may remember then that you told me how the description of your city which we then read, was more literal, than is easy to be believed, and withal more mystical than it is possible for the wisest of mortals to comprehend. And in particular you told me that it was built first of true and substantial Gold; secondly of fine Gold; thirdly of transparent or glassy Gold; and fourthly of living Gold.</p>\n<p>I desire now that you would answer me to all these particulars in order. Do you then say that this city is built of true Gold, and that it is not only metaphorically said to be built of Gold? Is it as real and substantial, is it as visible and palpable, and has it as many good qualities as this which I have now in my hand?</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Yes, Philochrysus, I can assure you that it is built of true and not metaphorical Gold, as some would have it only to be. This Gold, I say, is no less real and substantial, and no less visible and palpable to its inhabitants and has as many, yea more, good qualities that that which you hold in your hand, and seem so pleased with. I know that this is a strange language, and I shall have much ado to make myself understood by you but in any degree. Because I must speak of that which you have never seen, or handled; though others have both seen and handled of it, and you also may come in time to do the same. So that it will be almost as hard a matter for one that is born blind to understand the philosophy of colours, or one born deaf the nature and distinction of sounds, as for you to comprehend what I am about to say of a certain substance that is visible to some but not to you, palpable to some but not to you; and which therefore you have no kind of apprehension of.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I promise to be very attentive. Do me the favour but to satisfy me as far as you can.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Well, I will endeavour your satisfaction, after that you shall have answered me a question or two that I have to propose to you.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I am very ready to do it.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Why do ye believe that piece of Gold which ye showed me, to be true, real and substantial, and not shadowy, figurative and accidental?</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: Why do I believe so? I am not such a stranger to the truth, as not to be able to distinguish it from a shadow. A shadow will fly from me if I go to catch at it, but this I can grasp fast enough. A shadow depends on the substance, and on the position of the Sun which casts it. It has no figure but from the substance, and that is always very faint and weak; it cannot be touched, it has no ponderosity, no light, no power in it. But this is ponderous, bright and powerful. You see me touch it, and its figure is not faint or weak but vivid and strong, without depending upon anything else. Wherever I move it, and whatever the position of it may be to the Sun or light, it still retains the same shape and the same substance. And now I have it fast, I dare venture its flying away.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: I see you are well satisfied with yourself. But pray tell me, how would you give a description of it, to satisfy another that had never seen it, or perhaps never heard of it; or if ever heard of it, yet not otherwise than as a figurative sound to please children with, or as a rattle, a picture, a shadow, a name without substance, without reality? How would you make it to be understood to a Philosopher, and how to a merchant that is no philosopher, supposing them both to be strangers to the nature and use of this sovereign metal?</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: Truly, Philadelphus, you begin to puzzle me. And besides I cannot see whither all your windings and turnings will at last lead me. Indeed, it would be a difficult matter to resolve satisfactorily either a Philosopher or a merchant concerning this dear precious metal, if they have not some manner of notice of it beforehand. But since it is not unlawful to make such a supposition, I am ready also to make such an answer as I can.</p>\n<p>I would therefore endeavour to satisfy them, by making use of such ideas, images and conceptions which they are already acquainted with; and by compounding them and dividing them, I would strive to frame in the inquirer an idea, image and conception hereof, which might approach as near as possible to the truth. As for instance, if I were to discourse with a philosopher, whom I will suppose to live in the remotest part of Tartary, or in some dark corner near to the Northern Pole where mines of Gold were never so much as heard of, and no name even found for it in the language of the country. I would think in the first place what to call it, that he might in some sort apprehend me, while I am discoursing with him. Now because some Copper mines may be near to him, and he may have both seen and handled and also tried several experiments upon this metal, therefore I will call it fine Copper or perhaps fine Brass, if this be likewise known to him. Then because I must speak to him in his own terms, and he has used himself to those of Mercury and Sulphur, I will tell him this fine Copper is compounded of a pure Mercurial Water and a pure Sulphureous earth, exactly proportioned and duly maturated and concocted by the Sun-beams in some proper matrix or vessel.</p>\n<p>Next I will, as far as I am able, show him the difference, both in quantity and quality, of the compounding principles of this fine Copper, and of his Copper. Whereupon I tell him that the Mercurial Water, which enters into the composition of this fine Copper, is not only more subtle, defecated and pure, than that which is in that Gothic Copper of his, but also that it is there in a much greater quantity. Likewise I tell him that the quantity of the Brimstone or Sulphureous Earth, which enters into the composition of the Gothic copper is greater than that which is in this fine (which I call for distinction the Peruvian) Copper, but that in the former it is more coarse than in the latter. Herein lies the main difference of the Peruvian and the Gothic Copper (which I must make my philosopher understand) as to the composition of the principles both in the one and the other. Which are both essentially the same, but diversified as well according to quality as quantity. He must then confess to me, that the Mercury in the Gothic Copper must needs be originally infected and poisoned, and that there must be a defect in its proportion: as likewise that the coarseness, the superfluity and the combustibleness of its Sulphur are no inconsiderable impediments to the perfection of this metal. And he will grant me to this, I believe, though he never have seen the fine metal of Peru, that there may be such a Copper there found as I do describe, if there may be but a Mercury, or water of Life, freed from its original infection and poison, and then fitly adapted and conjoined with a proper Sulphur that shall be pure and of an incombustible nature, so as not to diminish in the severest fires.</p>\n<p>However perhaps he will maintain, that I ought not altogether to despise the Sulphureous Earth of his Gothick Copper; for that though it were not so pure, fixed and permanent as that of the other, yet it was of the very same essence and nature with it, and therefore also might possibly come to be in like manner purified and made incombustible.<br />\nAnd when I have brought him thus far, then I may speak unto him of the several properties of our fine copper, and leave him to compare them with those of that coarse sort which is only known to him. And here if I could give him an exact calculation of the weight of a cubical inch of the Peruvian Copper, comparing it with a cubical inch of the Gothick and showing the preponderancy of that above this, I should settle in him a just idea as to one property of it. Another property is purity and clarity, which I must in the next place give him to understand by deduction from such ideas or conceptions which he has already admitted. A third is its tincture, and here as I must heighten that idea which he has entertained on one side, so I must lessen it on the other, that this man may exactly quadrate with the original. A fourth and main property which I am to tell him of is Fixation, or the immortality and indefectibility of the tincture, life or soul of this metallic body. Besides all which I may in the fifth place discourse to him of the extreme ductability or rarefaction of it; if it might not be too prodigious for his belief; and sixthly, of its medicinal uses and qualities, which would afford me a great variety of matters to entertain him with.</p>\n<p>And thus I shall have in some degree satisfied my Tartarian or my Gothick Philosopher, that the fine Copper of Peru is not metaphorical or symbolical, as his poor country men, who have never seen it, would persuade him: but that it is as truly, really and substantially of a metallic nature and consistence, as that which he daily handles for such. And he now begins to understand how this fine copper, which I otherwise call Gold, is compounded of the same (yet better graduated) principles, with a more exact proportion than his, and that it is not metaphorically, but really a metallic substance, more ponderous, and brighter than the other, also of a bitter (though not so deep) Tincture, more fixed and ductile, and lastly more proper for human bodies, to be used internally or externally, when prepared according to Art.</p>\n<p>So I take my leave of my Philosopher, and go next to my merchant. Here I shall not have so much to do, as with the former. I need only to mind him in brief of the several properties about which I discoursed my philosopher, and then declare unto him the great and excellent use thereof in commerce, so as more than four hundred times to answer the other in common valuation, and often more than five hundred.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Tis enough, I find you like well the subject that you are upon, but hope it will serve to lead you into one that is far better. Of all that you have now said, nothing will be found to be in vain, when I shall come to examine you. The tables may come perhaps to be turned upon yourself. Wherefore let me persuade you to try thoroughly, whether that be indeed gold, which you believe to be so. But since you have been pleased to satisfy me as to what I demanded, I am now most ready to satisfy you, as to what was propounded; only I must first premise two or three things that I may be understood by you. Wherefore be now attentive and consider well what I am about to say.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I will be sure Sir, to attend your motion, for I begin to be very jealous, that you have been carrying on all this while some plot to undermine me. But pray let us hear your premises, and I promise to make the best use of all the ears and eyes which I have.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: The first thing that I wish then to premise is this, That the Divine Blessing was originally spoken forth upon the whole Creation of God. Or as some would rather choose to express it - It was outspoken into the Creation, that is, by a real, vital and essential infusion engrafted into it. So that whatever come out of the hands of God was good. No evil should ever be derived from the Divine Being, who notwithstanding the supreme liberty of Will, is necessitated when He acts, to act according to Goodness. No sin nor death, no barrenness or drought, no weakness or disproportion could at all proceed from him. Wherefore he rejoicing, as it were, in the works of his hands, pronounced them both severally and universally to be good, yea very good, as considered in their whole system, and harmonious union with each other.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I cannot deny but that God blessed the whole Creation and that all the works of his hands are good. Make your best of it.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: The second thing that I have to premise is but as a corollary from the former, and is strengthened by universal experience. It is this, The Works of the Creation are not Now in the same State, as they were when they first came out of the hands of God, or as when the Divine Blessing was pronounced upon them, or outspoken onto them, yet with this limitation, so far as they are within our Sphere or Orb. For experience doth at this day too sufficiently attest that the creatures, whether they be of the animal, vegetable or mineral kingdom, cannot be all said to be good, howsoever they be considered, either separately by themselves, or conjunctly in harmony with the rest. And whatever may be pleaded on their behalf by some acute philosophers and divines, that all the creatures are, even at this day, good; though not positively, yet relatively, and with respect both to their present constitution and the constitution of the world in general, it is evident, to me at least, if either the undoubted records of scripture, or the natural light of reason may judge of the appeal, that all that they can say will, if it prove any thing, certainly conduce to the very overturning of the positive goodness of the Divine Being, and the introducing in the room thereof a certain relative, hypothetical and imaginary goodness, and to the building up a very odd and irregular system of the Universe.</p>\n<p>This if it were necessary, I might at large deduce through several particulars, proving the absurdity and inconsistency of such a supposition, that has been taken up of late by some men of name, and by them too mush authorised to the dishonour of God, though they might not perhaps design it so, as I am apt both to hope and believe. But this would lead me out very far and keep me too long from the resolution of the question in hand. However, Philochrysus, if at any other time you think it worth your while to demand a particular satisfaction as to this point, I shall be most willing to give it to you.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I thank you, Philadelphus. At present I am well enough satisfied in this matter; yea so much as I have often with my self admired, even when bit by a flea, how any could be serious in pleading for the perfection of the present constitution of the World of Nature, as if it never had been better, or was never to be better; but after it shall have lasted out such a term, that it must return back again into its primitive state of nothingness; by the most dreadful dissolution through Fire. This their catastrophe of Our World, I must confess, did never very well please me; but did always stick.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Its is then granted by you that the present constitution of this terrestrial world in which we live, is not so perfect and good as it was originally brought forth by God, and that it may, by the gift of god, recover again its original constitution.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: It is granted.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Well! Answer me now this one question. Which do you now think best deserves to be called by this or that name, that which is most perfect in its kind, and that which comes up most really to the true and original frame of its nature, or that which falls short of it, and is very Imperfect as to its kind?</p>\n<p>As for instance, you take two sheep, or two horses, and of these let one be placed at the right hand and the other at the left. Suppose now the horse at the right hand to have all the most excellent features and proportions of an horse, and that at the left to have none of them at all, but to be very mean and despicable. Suppose also the sheep at the right hand, to be very plump and fat, and to wear a Golden Fleece upon its back, and that at the left to be lean, deformed and leprous. Will you hereupon say that the horse at the left hand is a real horse, but that at the right a metaphorical one? Or that the sheep at the left is a true sheep, but not that at the right? And will you not rather say that these by approaching nearer to the perfection of their nature, and to the original integrity and beauty in which they were first both brought forth from the Divine exemplar, do less deserve to be called figurative or allegorical than the other.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: So indeed it seems to me, if either of these may be called a figurative sheep, or a figurative horse, it must be the left-handed ones, who come not up to the primitive constitution of their nature, into which the divine blessing was spoken, but have fallen under the curse, and suffered the depravation of their first pure form, according to the supposition that is granted you. And if any one had ever seen such an other but such lean and deformed sheep, or such ill conditioned and disproportioned jakes, verily I say should much condemn his rashness, if he should say there were no other, but positively conclude these to be the best of the kind, and that above them are but hypothetical metaphors, or poetical expressions of somewhat transcending nature. Yea I should be a little angry if he should be so obstinate as to stand out against the authentic relations of ocular witness, or go to oblige me to deny my own senses, because his have not had the same experience which mine also had.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Suppose also that you have two bushels of wheat, the one whereof is half full of chaff, the other perfectly cleansed, the one blighted, the other large grained and sound. Would you say that the blighted and chaffy corn is only real and substantial, but the sound and the cleansed to be no more than a metaphor or a shadow. I believe not.</p>\n<p>Suppose once more that you have two pips of Spanish wine, the one natural and unsophisticated, clean and sprightly, the other pipe sophisticated and filled up half with water: and that you have tasted only of the latter. Would you say that this only is true wine, and not the other?</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: No, Philadelphus, I think I should not so far expose my own judgment. And though I should not have tasted of the finest wine, yet would I not say there is no better than that I have tasted; and assert that what I am told of the other is only fancy or figure.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Now my dear Philochrysus, Hold to your words. For I see two pieces of gold, the one as at your right hand, the other is at your left, the one celestial gold, the other terrestrial gold, like as there are bodies celestial and bodied terrestrial. The gold of your left hand you see and handle, and say therefore that it is substantial. The gold of the right hand you see not neither can you handle, and conclude therefore that it is shadowy. The reason whereof is this. The former has a peculiar virtue in it to blind that eye by which the former Gold may be discerned, and to induce such a paralytic numbness and deadness on all one part of the man that has a lust after it, that he cannot possibly feel or handle the other till his disease be first removed from him. But as for me, that Gold which you call substantial, I should of the two rather choose to call shadowy Gold, and that which you think to be shadowy and figurative, I must call substantial and real, on far greater reasons than you have produced to move me to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I cannot but believe my senses. You shall not easily persuade me out of them. For if they deceive me, I can be certain of nothing.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Be not afraid: you may keep your senses still for me. Since the senses deceive none; but it is the judgment which is made upon them that may be erroneous. Take care therefore that you judge not amiss, and think that to be in the object itself which is nothing but an impression produced by it upon the sensory. But tell me, do you ever dream?</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: Yes I do.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: You may then remember how you thought that you have seen, felt and handled various objects which have vanished away as soon as you awakened.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I do. And particularly I call to mind, how I have sometime thought myself to be rolling among bags of gold. So that it has been no small trouble to me to find myself undeceived in the morning.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Forget not this. The application will not be difficult, and very nearly concerns you, my friend. Philochrysus, you are in a dream at this very instant, and you will certainly find yourself undeceived in the morning, when your senses that are now locked up in sleep shall recover themselves.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: In a dream say you? Nay, then the whole world is a dream. All that I do is dream and fancy, and whatever I behold or handle is but a shadow. Will you make all the world beside yourself to be in a dream? Will you make all the hurly-burlies in it, all the traffickings, negotiations, and wars, with all manner of transactions, private and public, civil and religious, to be nothing more but the sportive imaginations of the night? Will you make nothing to be real or substantial of what is seen, felt , heard or understood by us poor mortals? Sure,Phildelphus, you are no sceptic.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: No, I am an eclectic. But yet I have found the good of scepticism, as to many things that you believe. And if it go not too far, it is the foundation of all solid knowledge, natural, political or divine. Wherefore, however strange it may appear to you, it is not very far from the truth, to say that this world, with all that is in it, is but a dream or a shadow when compared with the invisible worlds. I am afraid to press you too much with these matters, and therefore I only said it is not very far from the truth to say so, but the indubitable records wherein in manifestly the finger of God, would bear me out, if I should say that it is the very truth itself. Search into these and you will find enough to open your eyes and let you see that the form of this World passeth away, and that all that belongs to it is no more than as a vision of the might, which flies away with the day break. My thoughts have been formerly the same with yours: the poisoned cup from the hand of the Fair Harlot, whom I have mentioned to you, cast me into a deep sleep. And in it I remember, I had just the same dreams which you have now. I thought terrestrial gold was as substantial as you imagine it to be, and of the celestial gold I had no manner of apprehension; but was contented to look on it as a figure and not as a substance. But I was roused out of my sleep by a swift messenger out of the Heavenly Philadelphia, upon which all the enchanted scenes of the night immediately fled away, and I awakened recovering the senses which had been before chained up, and then I quickly perceived my errors. Ah! Philochrysus! Awake! Awake! There stands now at your right hand one of the citizens of that beautiful city, who holds before him a medal made of the same gold, which he would present to you, if you would but suffer your eyes to be opened, and would not hold so fast the shadow.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: What mean you to do with me? Oh! A little more sleep, a little more slumber, a little more of this worlds, and then I awake. Disturb me not.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: He talks in his sleep. Ho! Ho! Philochrysus. You will not yet be awakened I find. I will therefore for a little time grant you your hearts desire, and this once, suppose that you are not asleep while you sleep, but that your dream is a reality, and all the conclusions that you have made from the exercise of your outward senses to be true. For by parity of reason (even granting what you say) as you do conclude the terrestrial gold to be true, real and substantial, I do conclude the celestial to be so, and much more so. If you plead sensation for yours, I know those that plead it for ours, and that deserve as much (at least) to be believed as any that you bring. But lest you might not so readily believe or apprehend perhaps the witnesses that I could produce, I will proceed with you as you would do with your Goth or Tartar, that had never heard of the gold mines of Peru. Wherefore I must needs tell you that if the Peruvian gold be true gold, then the Philadelphian gold deserves also of right so to be called, yea is much better qualified of the two to bear this name, as it is more perfect in its kind, and as it more nearly approaches then the former to the true and original frame of pure and undefiled nature, exactly compounded according to the divine exemplar, and duly concocted in the bowels of the everlasting mountains, the mountains of the Sun and the Mountains of the Moon. Whence, supposing the difference of Philadelphian and Peruvian Gold to be, as the difference of Peruvian and Gothic Copper; this will not hinder but that the Philadelphian Gold, both according to the greater purity of its constituent principles (as without the least alloy of the curse) and the most exact proportion of then, may well deserve to be looked on no less real than the Peruvian.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: If it be so, pray dear Philadelphus, give me some of it, that I may make a proof.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: You are not yet out of your dream, you know not what you say. For you neither understand what manner of Gold this is, neither who it is that can give it. It may be called to you by a thousand names, but I do assure you that it is true and proved gold. And let me tell you that your gold, or the false brass of Peru, is not constituted of Principles altogether pure and defected, but mixed with some close and inherent imperfections. Neither are the proportions adjusted according to perfect Nature, but only according to the perfect constitution of this terrestrial orb. The curse that has entered into the whole lower Creation has also entered into this, and it is not a perfect metal, except with respect to the lapsed and broken frame of this our Earth.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: Hah! Philadelphus! I am wondering where you will run at last. I am not so much in a dream, but I can laugh at these amusements of yours. Did ever any before deny Gold to be a perfect metal?</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Mistake me not. I do not deny it to be a perfect metal with respect to the present order of things in their Fallen State. But I do positively aver that it is not a perfect metal with respect to that primitive and original order of Beings which proceeded immediately from God through His Word, wherein and whereby they subsist; but that it partakes of the curse, as well as all the other subjects of the mineral or metallic kingdom, though not in the same degree. Now there is an Inherent curse, and there is also an Adherent Curse, and of both of these it more or less participates.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: Pray what do you mean by an Inherent Curse, and how do you appropriate it to the Terrestrial Gold.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Know what is the Blessing and you cannot fail to know what is the Curse in Nature. There is an Inherent Blessing in every creature, and there is also an Adherent Blessing. Without the former God could never have pronounced them good, and without the latter they could never have been serviceable to man, or to the rest of their fellow creatures. A privation, or loss, in either of these kinds, is called the Curse. And as it has diverse degrees and is variously specified, so takes it up diverse names, as Death, Darkness, Hades, Sheol, the Turba, the Left Hand, the Seed of the Serpent, the Mist out of the Earth, Lilith, Arimanius, Poison, the Blood of the Old Dragon, the Prisons, the North, and many others.</p>\n<p>The benediction now of both kinds may be lessened, hidden or removed either in part of in whole. The Adherent Benediction may possibly admit of a total remove and separation, but the inherent can never do this without the destruction and annihilation of the subject wherein it is. Whence though it may be hid, yet can it never be separated without the entire disunion of its constituent and vital principles. Which are not perishable, but endure the same, notwithstanding all the cortices, veils, and coverings, wherewith they may be overcast or oppressed, and which are said to be under the president-ship of so many evil Angels.</p>\n<p>Behold then here is Wisdom to take away the Inherent Curse from the creature, and to cause the disappeared Blessing to reappear, and exert forth itself. Now shall you understand how this curse is to be appropriated to the terrestrial Gold, and how the contrary Blessing is to be predicated of the celestial. But in the first place you are to take notice, that as the inherent is here less than in any other subjects of the same Kingdom and Order, so the Adherent Curse is greater. In the second place you are to observe that the primary and Radical principles being (as to us) invisible in themselves, the secondary and elementary, which may be made visible, can be here only examined into.<br />\nIn the third place, I am now to acquaint you that these elementary principles, which I call also Spermatical, as I call the former Seminal, are vastly different in the state of pure and of corrupt Nature.</p>\n<p>For in pure nature there is found a bright living crystalline water, full of spirit, power and energy; but in Nature corrupted there is a water that is opposite to this, being without Light, Life, or purity, without spirituality or strength, and void of all benign efficacy. Wherefore as a stagnated pool remote from the sun beams, or as a dead insipid phlegm, is not to be regarded or valued, so likewise there is found a bright, living and crystalline earth (such as hath been, and such as will be, and such as is even at this time, when it appears not, except to some few) which is sometimes compared to fine silver, and is called the Salt of the Earth. And in this Blessed earth is locked up the Spirit, Energy and Seed of the Mineral and vegetable kingdoms in their purest constitution, yea and of the animal too. For that it contains in itself the Fire of Nature, by which the wheel of her Magia, according to all the seven forms and spirits is set to work.</p>\n<p>On the contrary there is a dull, dead and opaceous earth that is mixed more or less with all terrestrial subjects, and that may by Art be separated from them. This is the Curse of the Earth which must be taken away and dissolved, before the Blessed and new Earth can appear, wherefore it is called the Damned Earth.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I hope you will not say that there is any of what the Chymists call Damned Earth in this our Gold. For I cannot bear the thought of it. Pray therefore explain yourself here a little.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: It is you yourself that make the particular application, for I did not. And indeed, Sir, I was almost afraid to touch you so near the quick. But if your Gold, Philochrysus, be a terrestrial subject (which you will scarce deny) then I am sure it must have some share of this Damned earth in it. For the Curse has not a command to stop when it came to a mine of Gold, but like a leaven it passed through and through, and infected the whole earth, and all that belonged to it. There might not indeed so much of it here abide as elsewhere, and therefore I said there was less of the Inherent Curse in this, than in any other subject of the same kingdom or order. Yet there is some, and that too very considerable, if either reason or experience may be allowed to pass the judgment. But this would lead us too far into a Philosophical disquisition.</p>\n<p>Let it suffice at present to consider whether what a vulgar and ordinary artist may be able to give an ocular demonstration of in the greatest part of earthly subjects, an expert master may not be as able to give the same in All?</p>\n<p>Wherefore be not angry, dear sir, at what I have asserted, but learn to bear the thought of what will be so much your disappointment, as to let you see the fair idol of your heart is not so lovely as you have imagined it to be, and that it is not all true gold that glisters in your hand.</p>\n<p>There is a Damned Earth Terra Damnata et Maledicta that cleaves so fast to it, as is not (easily) to be separated by the refiners art. And I am informed from credible testimonies, that whosoever shall be understanding in heart and skillful in hand, to separate this vile earth from the precious Solar Earth in the body of Terrestrial Gold, shall find the quantity of the former (however small when compared to the inferior metals) to exceed the other. And if what is related concerning the degradation of Gold by an eminent and curious eye-witness of this nation, whom all the philosophical and Christian world stands obliged to (and who had this generous and noble design to vindicate Religion from all sectarian polity or partiality, and to establish it upon solid and immutable grounds, be true; and if also the daily experiments) made even in ordinary laboratories of the possibility of its supergradation and Exaltation, by losing in its weight, and so possessing an higher Tincture and Clarity, may deserve any credit: Then is it certain that it may still arrive to an higher degree both of Fixation and Purity, than it could ever meet with in the Bowels of the Accursed earth.</p>\n<p>But whether this can ever be quite set free from its Inherent Curse or no, is not so material to our present purpose. However there is a vein, I can assure you, of Paradisical Gold, which not having been with it infected, is by Moses pronounced to be good, (Genesis 2, 12). And yet even this is no more to be compared with the Philadelphian or Sionitical Gold, than the Peruvian is with it. Hereby you may, in part I hope apprehend what is meant both by the Blessing and the Curse, which are inherent in this Metallic body.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I do, I think, pretty well understand you. But pray what do you mean by an Adherent Curse, and how is that to be appropriated to the Terrestrial Gold?</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: The Adherent Curse is that which adheres or cleaves to the Creature, by external application, and not by Internal Constitution, or composition. And here by external application I mean not barely any outward abuse of the same whatever, but also (and chiefly) any degree of adhesion of the Human Soul to it, how intrinsic soever, and the more intrinsic still the more dangerous, it being foreign, incongruous, and extrinsic both to the Soul, and to the creature which she seeks to cleave as to her blessing. Now though your terrestrial Gold has indeed not so much of the inherent, yet has it far more of the Adherent Curse, which is much the worst of the two. And though it should be never so perfect as to its composition, that avails not if this other Curse sticks to it. Yea, on the contrary, this will be so much the greater and the heavier, as in the case of the Tartarization [2 Peter, 2, 4.] of those angels who kept not their first estate of adhesion to the Original Beauty and Goodness, and in that of the Golden Calf of Israel, concerning which the Jews have to this very day a celebrated proverb, that no punishment is ever inflicted upon them in which there is not some portion of this calf. And I fear the same may be justly applicable not to them alone. What Evil of Sin is there in the whole world that is not perpetrated for the sake of it? And what Evil of pain, or dreadful judgments by the Divine nemesis have not already been pulled down upon particular persons, upon families and upon whole kingdoms? Behold, and consider the times of old; what examples all histories both sacred and profane doth give you. To conclude, how many are there that for the sake of this, labour the greatest part of their lives in the very fire, who at length reap nought but smoke and dross, in the room of those Golden Mountains which they hereby imagined to themselves? And how many weary themselves all their lives for very vanity, while being deceived with the false show of an adhering blessing, they find only misery and repentance; who, had they taken but half that pains to discover the Paradisical or Philadelphian mine of Gold, would never have been left in such plunges at the last? Behold all this proceeds from its Adherent Curse. Remember, prithee Philochrysus, the dying aphorism of the richest Subject of the world at that time, as well as the best politician, and the most faithful servant; which famous aphorism is, I suppose, not unknown to you.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: You mean, I know the saying of that great man, which he left in his legacy to posterity: Had I but taken but half that pains to serve my God, as I took to serve my Prince, he would not now have deserted me.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: I do so. And withal I assure you, my good friend, that if you were but half as diligent in seeking after the celestial, as you are in seeking after the terrestrial Gold, you would be experimentally convinced that I have spoken nothing to you all this while but the very Truth, and you would find yourself possessed of substance instead of vanity.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I am at a loss. I know not what to make of that which you say. Disturb me not out of my sleep. For I would rather dream on at the old rate, than be molested. Have pity on me, and depart from me. For I am Philochrysus. I am a lover of that what you have contemptibly nick-named terrestrial Gold. The which to me is a Celestial substance. But you will hardly allow it to be a substance at all, that so you may the more exalt the Gold (as you call it) of your own country, which I must call imaginary. Tell me not then that mine is vanity, or the shadow only of a substance. Neither speak to me of labouring for smoke and dross. I know what is substance, I thank my stars, and I can distinguish between what is true and what is counterfeit. Mine hath been tried in the Fire, and weighed in the balance. It hath stood in the one; and in the other hath been found to have its just weight. Can you also pretend to this?</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Yes, more than pretend. Mine is indeed Gold tried in the Fire, and it has been also weighed in the balance as well as yours. And let me tell you besides, that your gold shall never be able to endure this fire-trial, but shall fly away in it as lead and dross. And one grain of the Gold of my City if put into the balance will preponderate this whole room full of yours. Whence the Crown that is mad out of this Gold is called emphatically a weight of Glory and an Hyperbolical or excessive weight, yea a far exceeding and Hyperbolically Hyperbolical weight [2 Corinthians 4,17.] So far exceeds the celestial Gold in preponderosity the terrestrial Gold when weighed together, as no hyperbole can reach. It exceeds in like manner in clarity and lustre, in fixation and permanency, in the superexcellency of its Tincture, in ductibility and divisibility; and in all manner of medicinal uses both for Spirit, Soul and Body, all which it revives, exhilarates and perfects. And in the last place all the merchandise of your World is not to be compared with it. This alone can truly and really and lastingly make you rich. It would not be difficult to particularize each of these, and to show hereby the reality and substantiality of this Gold that I plead for, not only equally with, but far above that which is dug out of the Earth. But all that can be said hereupon, would but serve so much the more to exasperate you if you comprehend it not, or will not attend to it. In vain therefore would it be for me to give you (at present) a particular description of its several properties, as also of its constituent principles and the manner of their union. I must wait to do that till those senses which are fallen asleep in you shall come to be awakened. But I am therefore sent that I might rouse you out of your sleep. Forgive me that I thus wake you. O Philochrysus! what has become of the eye-salve of Sophia? Arise and anoint your eyes.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: Hold! I think I now begin to see. I must confess that I can now see the possibility of what you drive at, but that it is actually so, I cannot yet perceive. I remember I was once a little acquainted with one that might possibly be of your society, and I did hear him exclaim from the pulpit in this manner: &quot;Think ye, ye shall be set up as pillars in the Temple of God to uphold it? or that you shall be full of gold in you pockets, of the finest gold tried in the Fire, like the rich men of the Earth? and to ruffle it in silks, and fine raiment as those in princes' courts? Do you think that these things are here meant in these promises made to the Seven Churches? No, No, dream of no such things, for I say there is not one word true according to the letter.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: I do say that every word, every syllable, every letter is true, and that there are real and substantial pillars in the Temple of God, real and substantial Gold in the City of God, and real and substantial raiment worn by the citizens thereof. And yet at the same time, I do assert that there is no Word, syllable or letter true, if strictly taken according to that low idea which the natural man has fixed to these words. For as much as there is a more than hyperbolical excess in the difference of one from the other. As each property by itself considered will manifest. And if you are convinced of the possibility (at least) of what I have said, you must acknowledge the actual existence hereof. For that there can be no other reason invented whereby you deny it, but its impossibility and inconsistency.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I resign therefore, and yield to you, that the City of Philadelphia may be built of true, real and substantial Gold, which has nothing of the curse either Inherent or Adherent sticking to it, according to the sense that the describer means, or that you explain, though not according to that which the natural man would have.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: You comprehend me right. I shall therefore proceed. I said then, in the second place, that it is built of fine Gold, much more fine and higher graduated than any you can ever have seen. This you may in part already understand by what has been said hitherto. But here I shall much more stand in need of words whereby to express myself.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I long greatly to hear you speak distinctly of this Superfine and supergraduated Gold. I shall not forget what you have said. Therefore proceed on.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: You need but remember your Gothic philosopher. Consider also that there is a twofold body, There is a material and elementary body, and there is an spiritual and a heavenly body. The one is gross, the other fine.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I can understand perfectly what you mean by the former, but the notion of an immaterial body seems to me the very same contradiction as that of an immaterial substance seemed to an eminent asserter of materialism called Philautus. If you had but him to deal with, he would make work, I believe, with your non-elementary and spiritual body.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: It may be so. But I never feared the strength of reasoning in Philautus, though I know him pretty well, and all his principles whether in Philosophy, Divinity or politics are opposite to mine. He is the express character of the natural man throughout, and in his works everywhere you have the most lively image of the Fallen State of Nature, whereof great advantage may be made by the wise, it being no where that I know so deeply and philosophically handled. This indeed he mistakes for the true and original State of Nature; but herein he speaks well enough, and true enough, as a natural or animal Man, and without deviating, most exactly follows his principles wherever they lead him. On the other side the most learned and profound of all his answerers very admirably both describes and demonstrates the true and original state of Nature, such as it was, and such as it shall be again, but not such as it is at present. As for Philautus he is not dead, but lives in his disciples, and will live as long as the present corrupt state of Nature shall remain upon the Earth. For the Psyche in man is never able to penetrate beyond the image; only the pure spirit of Sophia can reach to the life, which is so imaged out in discourse. Hence he who had only the Psyche, was not able to distinguish betwixt the one and the other, but he took them both to be the same. So finding in the origination of several languages that a Spirit was imaged forth or signified by Breath, he presently concludes that the Spirit and Breath were one and the same, and consequently that all Spirits (as such) were material and corporeal beings. he in the like manner, finding in the verbal image of substance was expressed that which stands under, or props up somewhat, entertained immediately a most gross and sensible conception hereof, and tied it down to matter. So then nothing could be a greater absurdity to him, or a more manifest contradiction, than to believe an immaterial substance, that is an immaterial matter. Now among those who have a great and just abhorrence for his sentiments, all are not set free themselves from the very same method of argumentation, as from a numerous induction of instances might be verified if need were.</p>\n<p>Wherefore I shall only beg of you what is highly necessary in order to your understanding of what I speak, and to your passing a judgment thereupon, that you content not yourself with the lax and popular sense of a word, as that which is generally very equivocal, but that you seek out the strict and close idea that is to be affixed to it, for the removal of all ambiguity in the terms, and the distinction of the image from its original, or (as the Schools would rather speak) of the Signum from Signatum, the sign from the thing signified.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: It is very just what you require, Phildelphus. None can gainsay this method, after what the celebrated author of An Essay on Human Understanding, together with a French philosopher of the first magnitude , have written on it, shall be looked into. Wherefore tell me in the first place, what you mean by Substance?</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Hereby I understand that which hath both Essence and Existence, being created by God, and made capable of bearing up, or supporting various modes of Being.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: What do you mean by Body?</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Hereby I understand a substance that is extended, and is capable of various modes of Extension. Two of which modes are penetrability and impenetrability.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: Is penetrability then a mode of extension? I always thought that all matter was impenetrable.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: True. All Matter is impenetrable, but all body is not. And penetrability is as much a mode of extension as impenetrability. For where there is no co-extension there is no penetration, and where there is no penetration there can be no life. Without therefore all Nature were dead, it remains that extended substances may be penetrated. Now there are extended substances, or rather one extended substance (of which I may speak to you hereafter) which can penetrate others, but which cannot be penetrated by any. There are also extended substances which can penetrate others by co-extension, and which may themselves also be penetrated by others. lastly there are extended substances or bodies which cannot penetrate others, but which may be penetrated by them. Thus by the outward light of this world, which is a body of the second order, the Earth may be penetrated, which can neither penetrate it or any other substance.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: What do you mean by Matter?</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Hereby I understand a body that is impenetrable, and divisible, and which is capable of various modes of division. So that all Matter is Body, but all Body is not Matter. By impenetrable I mean not that which cannot be at all penetrated, but I mean that which is not to be penetrated by any thing of its own order, and which itself can penetrate nothing.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: How can the same Body be impenetrable and divisible?</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Because it is impenetrable, therefore it is divisible into parts. For if it could be penetrated, then would there be no need of division, or separation of the parts? Wherefore that which is penetrable is also indivisible, or rather indiscerpible, and consequently incorruptible.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I comprehend your meaning. And now I conceive what is your notion of an immaterial or Spiritual Body called likewise a Non-elementary (which is a Quintessential) or heavenly Body; Namely, that it is an extended substance, penetrable, penetrative, indivisible, indiscerpible, and incorruptible. As on the contrary your notion of a material and elementary body must be this, that it is an extended substance, impenetrable, penetrated, divisible, discerpible and corruptible. I begin consequently to understand a little your notion of Material and Spiritual, of Elementary and Heavenly Gold, and why you call the one gross and the other fine Gold. But notwithstanding that I conceive how the Material and Elementary Gold is an extended Substance which is impenetrable to all terrestrial bodies, and may be penetrated by the Celestial, which is also divisible into parts, yea Discerpible into the minutest atoms, yet can I not easily yield that it should be corruptible.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: All that is compounded of Elements must be more or less corruptible. And though certain elementary bodies may have arrived at some degree of incorruptibility, yet it is but a degree, it being impossible for them to be ever perfectly freed from corruption, but by a dissolution and a resuscitation. For this is a most assured maxim, that all things must be perfected by the cross and all things must be tried by Fire. Without passing through the Cross there is no resurrection, without passing through the Fire there is no Fixation or Incorruption, no Purification or Spiritualization. Hence the messenger of the Covenant of Immortality is by a certain prophet compared to a refiner's Fire, who says of him that he will purify the Priesthood and purge them as Gold that they may rightly offer the sacrifice of Minha to Jehovah. Hence also a great and wise King says, the word (or outflowing emanation of the Lord is refined; and again he cries out: Thy Word is exceedingly refined most fine and pure. Likewise this very Word of the Lord or the Word the Lord saith to the shepherds of Israel: &quot;I will refine them as Silver is refined, and will try them as Gold is tried.&quot; And elsewhere he saith, &quot;I have refined you, melted you down, and then brought you out of the furnace.&quot; For this cause the precious Sons of Zion are compared to fine gold, and the Angelical man who appeared to Daniel had his loins Girded with fine Gold of Ophir. From this also an account may be given why the Altar of Incense was made of refined Gold, together with the Ark and the Cherubim. Also why Wisdom's oracle is so often compared to fine Gold; and lastly why the Shulamite describes both the head and the feet of her beloved to be as of fine Gold. That is such an indivisible, indiscerpible and incorruptible substance, as being extended is therefore a body, and as possessing all the properties of the material and gross Gold, is therefore a spiritual body, or immaterial and celestial gold.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: I must confess that I have always taken a spiritual body to be a contradiction in terms, for I never heard otherwise before but that Spirit and Body were contraries. But now I begin to mistrust that I have not been used rightly to apply ideas to words.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Your diffidence is well grounded. For I do not find that Spirit and Body are anywhere opposed as contraries in those writings which command the greatest authority and deference above all others to them. I find indeed frequently spirit and flesh to be set as opposites, but spirit and body never. Nay I find it there expressly asserted that there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so in like manner there is a natural Gold and there is a spiritual, which surpasseth the former, as the spiritual Body of the Resurrection doth this Natural and Elementary body which we now wear about us. Moreover the same highly mystic author tells those who being immersed in the flesh had no notion of a Spiritual or Heavenly Body, any more than you had.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: There are also Celestial Bodies (of a spiritual and heavenly property) and Bodies Terrestrial (of a material and earthly property as common gold but the Glory of the Celestial is one, and the glory of the Terrestrial is another; that is, the glory of the Philadelphian Gold differs from the glory of the Peruvian, as far as heaven is from Earth.</p>\n<p>Philochrysus: You extremely amaze me, good Philadelphus, to tell me that the City from whence you are named is built of such fine gold. But pray now go on, if you are not weary, to satisfy me in the third place, whether it be built of Transparent and Glassy Gold.</p>\n<p>Philadelphus: Be not over hasty, but take time to meditate upon what I (through the assistance of the Good Spirit) have freely communicated to you. Neither have I done yet with the former, for I am not yet come to the top of the ladder with you. Perhaps your head may be giddy in endeavouring to reach it at this present. Wherefore though I cannot be ever weary of discoursing these matters, yet I will now take my leave of you with one parallel instance, which you may digest against we meet the next time. Consider what difference there is betwixt the faeces of any terrestrial subject, from which the spirit is separated, and the Spirit itself of that very subject (which is a Spiritual Body) when seven times rectified; and hereby as in a glass you may discern how far that Gross and Earthly Gold I am speaking of, wherewith the Holy City of my brethren is built. In the meanwhile I shall leave with you this Hieroglyphical figure of a star being the mark of this Gold, and also of the city, showing its constituent parts the Water and Fire of the Philadelphians; it manifold and wonderful properties, how it is formed, and how it is made to multiply itself.</p>\n<h1 id=\"tract-on-the-tincture-and-oil-of-antimony-by-roger-bacon\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tract on the Tincture and Oil of Antimony by Roger Bacon <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#tract-on-the-tincture-and-oil-of-antimony-by-roger-bacon\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<h2 id=\"preface\" tabindex=\"-1\">Preface <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#preface\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Dear reader, at the end of his Tract on Vitriol, Roger Bacon mentions that because of the multiplication of the Tincture that is made from Vitriol, the lover of Art should acquaint himself with the <em>Tract De Oleo Stibii</em>. Therefore I considered that it would be good and useful that the <em>Tract De Oleo Stibii</em> follows next. And if one thoroughly ponders and compares these tinctures with one another, then I have no doubt that one will not finish without exceptional profit. Yet, every lover of Art, should mind always to keep one eye on Nature and the other on Art and manual labour. For, when these two do not stand together, then it is a lame work, as when someone thinks he can walk a long path on one leg only, which is easily seen to be impossible,</p>\n<p>Vale.</p>\n<pre><code>Joachim Tanckivs\nDe Oleo Antimonii Tractatus.\nROGERII BACONIS ANGLI\nSummi Philosophi &amp; Chemici.\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Stibium</em>, as the Philosophers say, is composed from the noble mineral Sulphur, and they have praised it as the black lead of the Wise. The Arabs in their language, have called it <em>Asinat vel Azinat</em>, the alchemists retain the name <em>Antimonium</em>. It will however lead to the consideration of high Secrets, if we seek and recognize the nature in which the Sun is exalted, as the Magi found that this mineral was attributed by God to the Constellation Aries, which is the first heavenly sign in which the Sun takes its exaltation or elevation to itself. Although such things are thrown to the winds by common people, intelligent people ought to know and pay more attention to the fact that exactly at this point the infinitude of secrets may be partly contemplated with great profit and in part also explored. Many, but these are ignorant and unintelligent, are of the opinion that if they only had <em>Stibium</em>, they would get to it by Calcination, others by Sublimation, several by Reverberation and Extraction, and obtain its great Secret, Oil, and Perfectum Medicinam. But I tell you, that here in this place nothing will help, whether Calcination, Sublimation, Reverberation nor Extraction, so that subsequently a perfect Extraction of <em>metallic virtue</em> that <em>translates the inferior into the superior</em>, may profitably come to pass or be accomplished. For such shall be impossible for you. Do not let yourselves be confused by several of the philosophers who have written of such things, i.e., Geber, Albertus Magnus, Rhasis, Rupecilla, Aristoteles and many more of that kind. And this you should note. Yes, many say, that when one prepares <em>Stibium</em> to a glass, then the evil volatile Sulphur will be gone, and the Oil, which may be prepared from the glass, would be a very fixed oil, and would then truly give an ingress and Medicine of imperfect metals to perfection. These words and opinions are perhaps good and right, but that it should be thus in fact and prove itself, this will not be. For I say to you truly, without any hidden speech; if you were to lose some of the above mentioned Sulphur by the preparation and the burning, as a small fire may easily damage it, so that you have lost the right penetrating spirit, which should make our whole <em>Antimonii</em> corpus into a perfect red oil, so that it also can ascend over the helm with a sweet smell and very beautiful colors and the whole body of this mineral with all its members, without loss of any weight, except for the foecum, shall be an oil and go over the helm. And note also this: How would it be possible for the body to go into an oil, or give off its sweet oil, if it is put into the last essence and degree? For glass is in all things the outermost and least essence. For you shall know that all creatures at the end of the world, or on the last and coming judgement of the last day, shall become glass or a lovely amethyst and this according to the families of the twelve Patriarchs, as in the families of jewels which Hermes the Great describes in his book: As we have elaborately reported and taught in our book de Cabala.</p>\n<p>You shall also know that you shall receive the perfect noble red oil, which serves for the translation of metals in vain, if you pour <em>acetum correctum</em> over the Antimonium and extract the redness. Yes not even by Reverberation, and even if its manifold Beautiful colors show themselves, this will not make any difference and is not the right way. You may indeed obtain and make an oil out of it, but it has no perfect force and virtue for transmutation or translation of the imperfect metals into perfection itself. This you must certainly know.</p>\n<h2 id=\"and-now-we-proceed-to-the-manual-labour-and-thus-the-practica-follows.\" tabindex=\"-1\">AND NOW WE PROCEED TO THE MANUAL LABOUR, AND THUS THE PRACTICA FOLLOWS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#and-now-we-proceed-to-the-manual-labour-and-thus-the-practica-follows.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Take in the Name of God and the Holy Trinity, fine and well cleansed <em>Antimonii</em> ore, which looks nice, white, pure and internally full of yellow rivulets or veins. It may also be full of red and blue colors and veins, which will be the best. Pound and grind to a fine powder and dissolve in a water or Aqua Regis, which will be described below, finely so that the water may conquer it. And note that you should take it out quite soon after the solution so that the water may conquer it. And note that you should take it out quite soon after the solution so that the water will have no time to damage it, since it quickly dissolves the <em>Antimonii</em> Tincture. For in its nature our water is like the ostrich, which by its heat digests and consumes all iron; for given time, the water would consume it and burn it to naught, so that it would only remain as an idle yellow earth, and then it would be quite spoilt.</p>\n<p>Consider by comparison Luna, beautiful clean and pure, dissolved in this our water. Let it remain therein for no more than a single night when the water is still strong and full of Spirit, I tell you, that your good Luna has then been fundamentally consumed and destroyed and brought to nought in this our water.</p>\n<p>And if you want to reduce it to a pure corpus again, then you will not succeed, but it will remain for you as a pale yellow earth, and occasionally it may run together in the shape of a horn or white horseshoe, which may not be brought to a corpus by any art.</p>\n<p>Therefore you must remember to take the Antimonium out as soon as possible after the Solution, and precipitate it and wash it after the custom of the alchemists, so that the matter with its perfect oil is not corroded and consumed by the water.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-water-wherein-we-dissolve-the-antimonium-is-made-thus:\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE WATER; WHEREIN WE DISSOLVE THE ANTIMONIUM, IS MADE THUS: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-water-wherein-we-dissolve-the-antimonium-is-made-thus:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Take <em>Vitriol</em> one and a half (alii 2. lb.), <em>Sal armoniac</em> one pound, <em>Arinat</em> (alii Alun) one half pound / <em>Sal niter</em> one and a half pound, <em>Sal gemmae</em> (alii Sal commune) one pound, <em>Alumen crudum</em> (alii Entali) one half pound. These are the species that belong to and should be taken for the Water to dissolve the Antimonium.</p>\n<p>Take these Species and mix them well among each other, and distill from this a water, at first rather slowly. For the Spiritus go with great force, more than in other strong waters. And beware of its spirits, for they are subtle and harmful in their penetration.</p>\n<p>When you now have the dissolved <em>Antimony</em>, clean and well sweetened, and its sharp waters washed out, so that you do not notice any sharpness any more, then put into a clean vial and overpour it with a good distilled vinegar. Then put the vial in <em>Fimum Equinum</em>, or <em>Balneum Mariae</em>, to putrefy forty (al.i four) days and nights, and it will dissolve and be extracted red as blood. Then take it out and examine how much remains to be dissolved, and decant the clear and pure, which will have a red colour, very cautiously into a glass flask. Then pour fresh vinegar onto it, and put it into Digestion as before, so that that which may have remained with the faecibus, it should thus have ample time to become dissolved. Then the faeces may be discarded, for they are no longer useful, except for being scattered over the earth and thrown away. Afterwards pour all the solutions together into a glass retort, put into <em>Balneum Mariae</em>, and distill the sharp vinegar rather a fresh one, since the former would be too weak, and the matter will very quickly become dissolved by the vinegar. Distill it off again, so that the matter remains quite dry. Then take common distilled water and wash away all sharpness, which has remained with the matter from the vinegar, and then dry the matter in the sun, or otherwise by a gentle fire, so that it becomes well dried. It will then be fair to behold, and have a bright red color. The Philosophers, when they have thus prepared our <em>Antimonium</em> in secret, have remarked how its outermost nature and power has collapsed into its interior, and its interior thrown out and has now become an oil that lies hidden in its innermost and depth, well prepared and ready. Henceforth it cannot, unto the last judgement, be brought back to its first essence. And this is true, for it has become so subtle and volatile, that as soon as it senses the power of fire, it flies away as a smoke with all its parts because of its volatility.</p>\n<p>Several poor and common labourers, when they have prepared the <em>Antimonium</em> thus, have taken one part out, to take care of their expenses, so that they may more easily do the rest of the work and complete it, They then mixed it with one part <em>Salmiac</em>, one part <em>Vitro</em> (alii. Nitro, alii. Titro), one part <em>Rebohat</em>, to cleanse the <em>Corpera</em>, and then proceeded to project this mixture onto a pure <em>Lunam</em>. And if the Luna was one Mark, they found two and a half Loth good gold after separation; sometimes even more. And therewith they had accomplished a work providing for their expenses, so that they might even better expect to attain to the Great Work. The foolish called this a bringing into the Lunam, but they are mistaken. For such gold is not brought in by the Spiritibus (alii. Speciebus), but any Luna contains two Mark gold to the Loth, some even more. But this gold is united to the Lunar nature to such a degree that it may not be separated from it, neither by <em>Aquafort</em>, nor by common <em>Antimonium</em>, as the goldsmiths know. When however the just mentioned mixture is thrown onto the Lunam in flux, then such a separation takes place that the Luna quite readily gives away her implanted gold either in <em>Aquafort</em> or in <em>Regal</em>, and lets herself separate from it, strikes it to the ground and precipitates it, which would or might otherwise not happen. Therefore it is not a bringing into the Lunam, but a bringing out of the Luna.</p>\n<p>But we are coming back to our <em>Proposito</em> and purpose of our work, for we wish to have the Oil, which has only been known and been acquainted with this magistry, and not by the foolish.</p>\n<p>When you then have the <em>Antimonium</em> well rubified according to the above given teaching, then you shall take a well rectified <em>Spiritum vini</em>, and pour it over the red powder of <em>Antimony</em>, put it in a gentle Balneum* Mariae* to dissolve for four days and nights, so that everything becomes well dissolved. If however something should remain behind, you overpour the same with fresh <em>Spiritu vini</em>, and put it into the <em>Balneum Mariae</em> again, as said before, and everything should become well dissolved. And in case there are some more faeces there, but there should be very little, do them away, for they are not useful for anything. The Solutiones put into a glass retort, lute on a helm and connect it to a receiver, also well luted, to receive the Spiritus. Put it into Balneum Mariae. Thereafter you begin, in the Name of God, to distill very leisurely at a gentle heat, until all the Spiritus Vini has come over. You then pour the same Spiritum that you have drawn off, back onto the dry matter, and distill it over again as before. And this pouring on and distilling off again, you continue so often until you see the Spiritum vini ascend and go over the helm in all kinds of colours. Then it is time to follow up with a strong fire, and a noble blood red Oleum will ascend, go through the tube of the helm and drip into the recipient. Truly, this is the most secret way of the Wise to distill the very highly praised oil of Antimonii, and it is a noble, powerful, fragrant oil of great virtue, as you will hear below in the following. But here I wish to teach and instruct you who are poor and without means to expect the Great Work in another manner; not the way the ancients did it by separating the gold from the Luna. Therefore take this oil, one lot, [ancient weight unit used for the weighing of gold and silver coins - about 1/30 pound] eight lot of Saturn calcined according to art, and carefully imbibe the oil, drop by drop, while continuously stirring the calx Saturni. Then put it ten days and nights in the heat, in the furnace of secrets, and let the fire that this furnace contains, increase every other day by one degree. The first two days you give it the first degree of fire, the second two days you give it the second degree, and after four days and nights you put it into the third degree of fire and let it remain there for three days and nights. After these three days you open the window of the fourth degree, for which likewise three days and nights should be sufficient. Then take it out, and the top of the Saturnus becomes very beautiful and of a reddish yellow colour. This should be melted with Venetian Boreas. When this has been done, you will find that the power of our oil has changed it to good gold. Thus you will again have subsistence, so that you may better expect the Great Work. We now come back to our purpose where we left it earlier. Above you have heard, and have been told to distill the Spiritum vini with the Oleum Antimonii over the helm into the recipient as well as the work of changing the Saturnum into gold. But now we wish to make haste and report about the second tinctural work. Here it will be necessary to separate the Spiritum vini from the oil again, and you shall know that it is done thus:</p>\n<p>Take the mixture of oil and wine spirit put it into a retort, put on a helm, connect a receiver and place it all together into the Balneum Mariae. Then distill all the Spiritum vini from the oil, at a very gentle heat, until you are certain that no more Spiritus vini is to be found within this very precious oil. And this will be easy to check; for when you see several drops of Spiritu vini ascend over the helm and fall into the recipient, this is the sign that the Spiritus vini has become separated from the oil. Then remove the fire from the Balneo, though it was very small, so that it may cool all the sooner. Now remove the recipient containing the Spiritu vini, and keep it in a safe place, for it is full of Spiritus which it has extracted from the oil and retained. It also contains admirable virtues, as you will hear hereafter.</p>\n<p>But in the Balneo you will find the blessed bloodred Oleum Antimonii in the retort, which should be taken out very carefully. The helm must be very slowly removed, taking care to soften and wash off the Lute, so that no dirt falls down into the beautiful red oil and makes it turbid. This oil you must store with all possible precaution so that it receives no damage. For you now have a Heavenly Oil that shines on a dark night and emits light as from a glowing coal. And the reason for this is that its innermost power and soul has become thrown out unto the outermost, and the hidden soul is now revealed and shines through the pure body as a light through a lantern: Just as on Judgement Day our present invisible and internal souls will manifest through our clarified bodies, that in this life are impure and dark, but the soul will then be revealed and seen unto the outermost of the body, and will shine as the bright sun. Thus you now have two separate things: Both the Spirit of Wine full of force and wonder in the arts of the human body: And then the blessed red, noble, heavenly Oleum Antimonii, to translate all diseases of the imperfect metals to the Perfection of gold. And the power of the Spiritual Wine reaches very far and to great heights. For when it is rightly used according to the Art of Medicine: I tell you, you have a heavenly medicine to prevent and to cure all kinds of diseases and ailments of the human body. And its uses are thus, as follows:</p>\n<h2 id=\"against-podagra-or-gout\" tabindex=\"-1\">AGAINST PODAGRA or GOUT <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#against-podagra-or-gout\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In the case of gout one should let three drops of this Spiritu vini, that has received the power of the Antimony, fall into a small glass of wine. This has to be taken by the patient on an empty stomach at the very moment in time when he sense the beginning or arrival of his trouble, bodily ailment and pain. On the next day and afterwards on the third day it should also be taken and used in the same way. On the first day it takes away all pain, however great it may be, and prevents swelling. On the second day it causes a sweat that is very inconstant, viscous and thick, that smells and tastes quite sour and offensive, and occurs mostly where the joints and limbs are attached.

And such is the manner and opinion of several of the ancients on how to prepare the gold. But I will show and teach you a much shorter, better and more useful way. Viz. that you instead of such prepared gold take one part Mercurii Solis, the preparation of which I have already taught in another place by its proper process. Draw off its airy water so that it becomes a subtle dust and calx. Then take two parts of our blessed oil, and pour the oil very slowly, drop by drop onto the dust of the Mercurii Solis, until everything has become absorbed. Put it in a vial, well sealed, into a heat of the first degree of the oven of secrets, and let it remain there for ten days and nights. You will then see your powder and oil quite dry, such that it has become a single piece of dust of a blackish grey colour. After ten days give it the second degree of heat, and the grey and black colour will slowly change into a whiteness so that it becomes more or less white. And at the end of these ten days, the matter will take on a beautiful rose white. But this may be ignored. For this colour is only due to the Mercurio Solis, that has swallowed up our blessed oil, and now covers it with the innermost part of its body. But by the power of the fire, our oil will again subdue such Mercurium Solis, and throw it into its innermost. And the oil with its very bright red colour will rule over it and remain on the outside. Therefore it is time, when twenty years (sic) have passed, that you open the window of the third degree [The alchemical ovens had small openings at different heights, by means of which the heat was regulated.] The external white colour and force will then completely recede inwardly, and the internal red colour will, by the force of the fire, become external. Keep also this degree of fire for ten days, without increase or decrease. You will then see your powder, that was previously white, now become very red. But for the time being this redness may be ignored (is of no consequence), for it is still unfixed and volatile; and at the end of these ten days, when the thirtieth day has passed, you should open the last window of the fourth degree of fire, Let it stay in this degree for another ten days, and this very bright red powder will begin to melt. Let it stay in flux for these ten days. And when you take it out you will find on the bottom a very bright red and transparent stone, ruby colored, melted into the shape of the vial. This stone may be used for Projection, as has been taught in the tract on Vitriol. Praise God in Eternity for this His high revelation, and thank Him in Eternity. Amen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"on-the-multiplication-lapidis-stibii.\" tabindex=\"-1\">ON THE MULTIPLICATION LAPIDIS STIBII. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#on-the-multiplication-lapidis-stibii.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The ancient sages, after they had discovered this stone and prepared it to perfect power and translation of the imperfect metals to gold, long sought to discover a way to increase the power and efficiency of this stone. And they found two ways to multiply it: One is a multiplication of its power, such that the stone may be brought much further in its power of Transmutation. And this multiplication is very subtle, the description of which may be found in the Tract on Gold. The second multiplication is an Augmentum quantitatis of the stone with its former power, in such a way that it neither loses any of its power, nor gains any, but in such a manner that its weight increases and keeps on increasing ever more, so that a single ounce grows and increases to many ounces. To achieve this increase or Multiplication one has to proceed in the following manner: Take in the Name of God, your stone, and grind it to a subtle powder, and add as much Mercurii Solis as was taught before. Put these together into a round vial, seal with sigillo Hermetis, and put it into the former oven exactly as taught, except that the time has to be shorter and less now. For where you previously used ten (alii thirty) days, you may now not use more than four (alii ten) days. In other respects the work is exactly the same as before. Praise and thank God the Almighty for His high revelation, and diligently continue your prayers fir His Almighty Mercy and Divine blessings of this Work and Art as well as His granting you a good health and fortuitous welfare.

I testify that my master, Pythagoras, the Italian, master of the wise and chief of the Prophets, had a greater gift of God and of Wisdom than was granted to any one after Hermes. Therefore he had a mind to assemble his disciples, who were now greatly increased, and had been constituted the chief persons throughout all regions for the discussion of this most precious Art, that their words might be a foundation for posterity.

If the humidity and density of the air did not exist to separate the flames of the sun from living things, then the Sun would consume all creatures.</p>\n<p>Iximidrus Saith:- I testify that the beginning of all things is a Certain Nature, which is perpetual, coequalling all things, and that the visible natures, with their births and decay, are times wherein the ends to which that nature brings them are beheld and summoned. Now, I instruct you that the stars are igneous, and are kept within bounds by the air. If the humidity and density of the air did not exist to separate the flames of the sun from living things, then the Sun would consume all creatures. But God has provided the separating air, lest that which He has created should be burnt up. Do you not: observe that the Sun when it rises in the heaven overcomes the air by its heat, and that the warmth penetrates from the upper to the lower parts of the air? If, then, the air did not presently breathe forth those winds whereby creatures are generated, the Sun by its heat would certainly destroy all that lives. But the Sun is kept in check by the air, which thus conquers because it unites the heat of the Sun to its own heat, and the humidity of water to its own humidity. Have you not remarked how tenuous water is drawn up into the air by the action of the heat of the Sun, which thus helps the water against itself? If the water did not nourish the air by such tenuous moisture, assuredly the Sun would overcome the air. The fire, therefore, extracts moisture from the water, by means of which the air conquers the fire itself. Thus, fire and water are enemies between which there is no consanguinity, for the fire is hot and dry, but the water is cold and moist. The air, which is warm and moist, joins these together by its concording medium; between the humidity of water and the heat of fire the air is thus placed to establish peace. Then there arises a spirit from the tenuous vapour of the air, because the heat being joined to the humour, there necessarily issues something tenuous, which will become a wind. For the heat of the Sun extracts something tenuous out of the air, which also becomes spirit and life to all creatures. All this, however, is disposed in such manner by the will of God, and a coruscation appears when the heat of the Sun touches and breaks up a cloud.</p>\n<p>The Turba saith:- Well hast thou described the fire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-second-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Second Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-second-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Exumedrus saith:- The air is inspissated, and it is also made thin; it grows warm and becomes cold. The inspissation thereof takes place when it is divided in heaven by the elongation of the Sun; its rarefaction is when, by the exaltation of the Sun in heaven, the air becomes warm and is rarefied. It is comparable with the complexion of Spring, in the distinction of time, which is neither warm nor cold. For according to the mutation of the constituted disposition with the altering distinctions of the soul, so is Winter altered. The air, therefore, is inspissated when the Sun is removed from it, and then cold supervenes upon men.</p>\n<p>Whereat the Turba said:- Excellently hast thou described the air.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-third-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Third Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-third-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Anaxagoras saith:- I make known that the beginning of all those things which God hath created is weight and proportion, for weight rules all things, and the weight and spissitude of the earth is manifest in proportion; but weight is not found except in body.

Have you not observed how the spissitude of the four elements is conjoined in earth! The same, therefore, is more inspissated than all.</p>\n<p>Then saith the Turba:- Thou hast well spoken.

O Crowd of the Philosophers, know you not that it Is only sight which can distinguish white from black, and hearing only which can discriminate between a good and bad word!

Know that this creature, that is to say, the world, hath a light, which is the Sun, and the same is more subtle than all other natures, which light is so ordered that living beings may attain to vision. But if this subtle light were removed, they would become darkened, seeing nothing, except the light of the moon, or of the stars, or of fire, all which are derived from the light of the Sun, which causes all creatures to give light. For this God has appointed the Sun to be the light of the world, by reason of the attenuated nature of the Sun. And know that the sublime creature before mentioned has no need of the light of this Sun, because the Sun is beneath that creature, which is more subtle and more lucid. This light, which is more lucid than the light of the Sun, they have taken from the light of God, which is more subtle than their light. Know also that the created world is composed of two dense things and two rare things, but nothing of the dense is in the sublime creature. Consequently the Sun is rarer than all inferior creatures.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Thou hast excellently described what thou hast related.

But know, all ye Philosophers, that I declare this in order that I may fortify your opinion concerning these four elements and arcana, as well as in the sciences thereof, at which no one can arrive save by the will of God. Understand, that when God was alone, He created four things- fire, air, water, and earth, out of which things He afterwards created all others, both the sublime and the inferior, because He predestinated from the beginning that all creatures extracted from water should multiply and increase, that they might dwell in the world and perform His judgments therein. Consequently, before all, He created the four elements, out of which He afterwards created what He willed, that is to say, diverse creatures, some of which were produced from a single element.</p>\n<p>The Turba saith:- Which are these, O Master!</p>\n<p>And he:- They are the angels, whom He created out of fire.</p>\n<p>But the Turba:- Which, then, are created out of two?</p>\n<p>And he:- Out of the elements of fire and air are the sun, moon, and stars composed. Hence the angels are more lucid than the sun, moon, and stars, because they are created from one substance, which is less dense than two, while the sun and the stars are created from a composition of fire and air.</p>\n<p>The Turba saith:- And what concerning the creation of Heaven?</p>\n<p>Then he:- God created the Heaven out of water and air, whence this is also composed of two, namely, the second of the rarer things, which is air, and the second of the denser things, which is water.</p>\n<p>And they:- Master, continue thy discourse concerning these three, and rejoice our hearts with thy sayings, which are life to the dead.</p>\n<p>But the other answereth:- I notify to you that God hath further made creatures out of three and out of four; out of three are created flying things, beasts, and vegetables; some of these are created out of water, air, and earth, some out of fire, air, and earth.</p>\n<p>But the Turba saith:- Distinguish these divers creatures one from another.</p>\n<p>And he:- Beasts are created out of fire, air, and earth; dying things out of fire, air, and water, because flying things, and all among vegetables which have a spirit, are created out of water, while all brute animals are from earth, air, and fire. Yet in vegetables there is no fire, for they are created out of earth, water, and air.</p>\n<p>Whereat the Turba saith:- Let us assume that a fire, with your reverence's pardon, does reside in vegetables.</p>\n<p>And he:- Ye have spoken the truth, and I affirm that they contain fire.</p>\n<p>And they:- Whence is that fire?</p>\n<p>He answereth:- Out of the heat of the air which is concealed therein; for I have signified that a thin fire is present in the air, but the elementary fire concerning which you were in doubt is not produced, except in things which have spirit and soul. But out of four elements our father Adam and his sons were created, that is, of fire, air, water, and likewise earth. Understand, all ye that are wise, how everything which God hath created out of one essence dies not until the Day of Judgment. The definition of death is the disjunction of the composite, but there is no disjunction of that which is simple, for it is one. Death consists in the separation of the soul from the body, because anything formed out of two, three, or four components must disintegrate, and this is death. Understand, further, that no complex substance which lacks fire eats, drinks, or sleeps, because in all things which have a spirit fire is that which eats.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- How is it, Master, that the angels, being created of fire, do not eat, seeing thou assertest that fire is that which eats!</p>\n<p>And he: Hence ye doubt, each having his opinion, and ye are become opponents, but if ye truly knew the elements, ye would not deny these things. I agree with all whose judgment it is that simple fire eats not, but thick fire. The angels, therefore, are not created out of thick fire, but out of the thinnest of very thin fire; being created, then, of that which is most simple and exceedingly thin, they neither eat, drink, nor sleep.</p>\n<p>And the Turba:- Master, our faculties are able to perceive, for by God's assistance we have exhausted thy sayings, but our faculties of hearing and of sight are unable to carry such great things. May God reward thee for the sake of thy disciples, since it is with the object of instructing future generations that thou hast summoned us together from our countries, the recompense of which thou wilt not fail to receive from the Judge to come.</p>\n<p>Arisleus saith:- Seeing that thou hast gathered us together for the advantage of posterity, I think that no explanations will be more useful than definitions of those four elements which thou hast taught us to attain.</p>\n<p>And he:- None of you are, I suppose, ignorant that all the Wise have propounded definitions in God.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Should your disciples pass over anything, it becomes you, O Master, to avoid omissions for the sake of future generations.</p>\n<p>And he:- If it please you, I will begin the disposition here, since envious men in their books have separated that, or otherwise I will put it at the end of the book.</p>\n<p>Whereat the Turba saith:- Place it where you think it will be dearest for future generations.</p>\n<p>And he:- I will place it where it will not be recognised by the foolish, nor ignored by the Sons of the Doctrine, for it is the key, the perfection and the end.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ninth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Ninth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-ninth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Eximenus saith:- God hath created all things by his word, having said unto them: Be, and they were made, with the four other elements, earth, water, air, and tire, which He coagulated, and things contrary were commingled, for we see that fire is hostile to water, water hostile to fire, and both are hostile to earth and air. Yet God hath united them peacefully, so that they love one another. Out of these four elements, therefore, are all things created- heaven and the throne thereof; the angels; the sun, moon. and stars; earth and sea, with all things that are in the sea, which indeed are various, and not alike, for their natures have been made diverse by God, and also the creations. But the diversity is more than I have stated; each of these natures is of diverse nature, and by a legion of diversities is the nature of each diverse. Now this diversity subsists in all creatures, because they were created out of diverse elements. Had they been created out of one element, they would have been agreeing natures. But diverse elements being here mingled, they lose their own natures, because the dry being mixed with the humid and the cold combined with the hot, become neither cold nor hot; so also the humid being mixed with the dry becomes neither dry nor humid. But when the four elements are commingled, they agree, and thence proceed creatures which never attain to perfection, except they be left by night to putrefy and become visibly corrupt. God further completed his creation by means of increase, food, life, and government. Sons of the Doctrine, not without purpose have I described to you the disposition of these four elements, for in them is a secret arcanum; two of them are perceptible to the sense of touch and vision, and of these the operation and virtue are well known. These are earth and water. But there are two other elements which are neither visible nor tangible, which yield naught, whereof the place is never seen, nor are their operations and force known, save in the former elements, namely, earth and water; now when the four elements are not commingled, no desire of men is accomplished. But being mixed, departing from their own natures, they become another thing. Over these let us meditate very carefully.</p>\n<p>And the Turba:- Master, if you speak, we will give heed to Your words.</p>\n<p>Then he:- I have now discoursed, and that well. I will speak only useful words which ye will follow as spoken. Know, all present, that no true tincture is made except from our copper. Do not therefore, exhaust your brains and your money, lest ye fill your hearts with sorrow. I will give you a fundamental axiom, that unless you turn the aforesaid copper into white, and make visible coins and then afterwards again turn it into redness, until a Tincture: results, verily, ye accomplish nothing. Burn therefore the copper, break it up, deprive it of its blackness by cooking, imbuing, and washing, until the same becomes white.

Then stir in its water of Etheliae until it be coagulated, and the coins become variegated, which we call the Flower of Salt. Cook it, therefore, until it be deprived of blackness, and the whiteness appear. Then rub it, mix with the Gum of Gold, and cook until it becomes red Etheliae. Use patience in pounding lest you become weary. Imbue the Ethelia with its own water, which has preceded from it, which also is Permanent Water, until the same becomes red. This, then, is Burnt Copper, which is the Leaven of Gold and the Flower thereof. Cook the same with Permanent Water, which is always with it, until the water be dried up. Continue the operation until all the water is consumed, and it becomes a most subtle powder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-eleventh-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Eleventh Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-eleventh-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Parmenides saith:- Ye must know that envious men have dealt voluminously with several waters, brodiums, stones, and metals, seeking to deceive all you who aspire after knowledge. Leave, therefore, all these, and make the white red, out of this our copper, taking copper and lead, letting these stand for the grease, or blackness, and tin for the liquefaction. Know ye, further, that unless ye rule the Nature of Truth, and harmonize well together its complexions and compositions, the consanguineous with the consanguineous, and the first with the first, ye act improperly and effect nothing, because natures will meet their natures, follow them, and rejoice. For in them they putrefy and are generated, because Nature is ruled by Nature, which destroys it, turns it into dust, reduces to nothing, and finally herself renews it, repeats, and frequently produces the same. Therefore look in books, that ye may know the Nature of Truth, what putrefies it and what renews, what savour it possesses, what neighbours it naturally has, and how they love each other, how also after love enmity and corruption intervene, and how these natures should be united one to another and made at peace, until they become gentle in the fire in similar fashion. Having, therefore, noticed the facts in this Art, set your hands to the work. If indeed, ye know not the Natures of Truth, do not approach the work, since there will follow nothing but harm, disaster, and sadness. Consider, therefore, the teaching of the Wise, how they have declared the whole work in this saying:- Nature rejoices in Nature, and Nature contains Nature. In these words there is shewn forth unto you the whole work. Leave, therefore, manifold and superfluous things, and take quicksilver, coagulate in the body of Magnesia, in Kuhul, or in Sulphur which does not burn; make the same nature white, and place it upon our Copper, when it becomes white. And if ye cook still more, it becomes red, when if ye proceed to coction, it becomes gold. I tell you that it turns the sea itself into red and the colour of gold. Know ye also that gold is not turned into redness save by Permanent Water, because Nature rejoices in Nature.: Reduce, therefore, the same by means of cooking into a humour, until the hidden nature appear. If, therefore, it be manifested externally, seven times imbue the same with water, cooking, imbuing, and washing, until it become red. O those celestial natures, multiplying the natures of truth by the will of God! O that potent Nature, which overcame and conquered natures, and caused its natures to rejoice and be glad! This, therefore, is that special and spiritual nature to which the God thereof can give what fire cannot. Consequently, we glorify and magnify that [species], than which nothing is more precious in the true tincture, or the like in the smallest degree to be found. This is that truth which those investigating wisdom love. For when it is liquefied with bodies, the highest operation is effected. If ye knew the truth, what great thanks ye would give me! Learn, therefore, that while you are tingeing the cinders, you must destroy those that are mixed. For it overcomes those which are mixed, and changes them to its own colour. And as it visibly overcame the surface, even so it mastered the interior. And if one be volatile but the other endure the fire, either joined to the other endures the fire. Know also, that if the vapours have whitened the surfaces, they will certainly whiten the interiors. Know further, all ye seekers after Wisdom, that one matter overcomes four, and our Sulphur alone consumes all things.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth: Thou hast spoken excellently well, O Parmenides, but thou hast not demonstrated the disposition of the smoke to posterity, nor how the same is whitened!</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-twelfth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Twelfth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-twelfth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Lucas saith: I will speak at this time, following the steps of the ancients. Know, therefore, all ye seekers after Wisdom, that this treatise is not from the beginning of the ruling! Take quicksilver, which is from the male, and coagulate according to custom. Observe that I am speaking to you in accordance with custom, because it has been already coagulated. Here, therefore, is not the beginning of the ruling, but I prescribe this method, namely, that you shall take the quicksilver from the male, and shall either impose upon iron, tin, or governed copper, and it will be whitened. White Magnesia is made in the same way, and the male is converted with it. But forasmuch as there is a certain affinity between the magnet and the iron, therefore our nature rejoices.) Take, then, the vapour which the Ancients commanded you to take, and cook the same with its own body until tin is produced. Wash away its blackness according to custom, and cleanse and roast at an equable fire until it be whitened. But every body is whitened with governed quicksilver, for Nature converts Nature. Take, therefore, Magnesia, Water of Alum, Water of Nitre, Water of the Sea, and Water of Iron; whiten with smoke.: Whatsoever ye desire to be whitened is whitened with this smoke, because it is itself white, and whitens all things. Mix, therefore, the said smoke with its faeces until it be coagulated and become excessively white. Roast this white copper till it germinates of itself, since the Magnesia when whitened does not suffer the spirits to escape, or the shadow of copper to appear, because Nature contains Nature. Take, therefore, all ye Sons of the Doctrine, the white sulphureous nature, whiten with salt and dew, or with the Flower of White Salt, until it become excessively white. And know ye, that the Flower of White Salt is Ether from Ethelia. The same must be boiled for seven days, till it shall become like gleaming marble, for when it has reached this condition it is a very great Arcanum, seeing that Sulphur is mixed with Sulphur, whence an excellent work is accomplished, by reason of the affinity between them, because natures rejoice in meeting their own natures. Take, therefore, Mardek and whiten the same with Gadenbe, that is, wine and vinegar, and Permanent Water. Roast and coagulate until the whole does not liquefy in a fire stronger than its own, namely, the former fire. Cover the mouth of the vessel securely, but let it be associated with its neighbour, that it may kindle the whiteness thereof, and beware lest the fire blaze up, for in this case it becomes red prematurely, and this will profit you nothing, because in the beginning of the ruling you require the white. Afterwards coagulate the same until you attain the red. Let your fire be gentle in the whitening, until coagulation take place. Know that when it is coagulated we call it the Soul, and it is more quickly converted from nature into nature. This, therefore, is sufficient for those who deal with the Art of Coins, because one thing makes it but many operate therein. For ye need not a number of things, but one thing only, which in each and every grade of your work is changed into another nature.</p>\n<p>The Turba saith: Master, if you speak as the Wise have spoken, and that briefly, they will follow you who do not wish to be wholly shut in with darkness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-thirteenth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Thirteenth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-thirteenth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Pythagoras saith:- We posit another government which is not from another root, but it differs in name. And know, all ye seekers after this Science and Wisdom, that whatsoever the envious may have enjoined in their books concerning the composition of natures which agree together, in savour there is only one, albeit to sight they are as diverse as possible. Know, also, that the thing which they have described in so many ways follows and attains its companion without fire, even as the magnet follows the iron, to which the said thing is not vainly compared, nor to a seed, nor to a matrix, for it is also like unto these. And this same thing, which follows its companion without fire, causes many colours to appear when embracing it, for this reason, that the said one thing enters into every regimen, and is found everywhere, being a stone, and also not a stone; common and precious; hidden and concealed, yet known by everyone; of one name and of many names, which is the Spume of the Moon. This stone, therefore, is not a stone, because it is more precious; without it Nature never operates anything; its name is one, yet we have called it by many names on account of the excellence of its nature.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- O! Master! wilt thou not mention some of those names for the guidance of seekers?</p>\n<p>And he:- It is called White Ethelia, White Copper, and that which flies from the fire and alone whitens copper. Break up, therefore, the White Stone, and afterwards coagulate it with milk. Then pound the calx in the mortar, taking care that the humidity does not escape from the vessel; but coagulate it in the vessel until it shall become a cinder. Cook also with Spume of Luna and regulate. For ye shall find the stone broken, and already imbued with its own water. This, therefore, is the stone which we call by all names, which assimilates the work and drinks it, and is the stone out of which also all colours appear. Take, therefore, that same gum, which is from the scoriae, and mix with cinder of calx, which you have ruled, and with the faeces which you know, moistening with permanent water. Then look and see whether it has become a powder, but if not, roast in a fire stronger than the first fire, until it be pounded. Then imbue with permanent water, and the more the colours vary all the more suffer them to be heated. Know, moreover, that if you take white quicksilver, or the Spume of Luna, and do as ye are bidden, breaking up with a gentle fire, the same is coagulated, and becomes a stone. Out of this stone, therefore, when it is broken up, many colours will appear to you. But herein, if any ambiguity occur to you in our discourse, do as ye are bidden, ruling the same until a white and coruscating stone shall be produced, and so ye find your purpose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fourteenth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Fourteenth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fourteenth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Acsubofen saith:- Master, thou hast spoken without envy, even as became thee, and for the same may God reward thee!</p>\n<p>Pythagoras saith:- May God also deliver thee, Acsubofen, from envy!</p>\n<p>Then he:- Ye must know, O Assembly of the Wise, that sulphurs are contained in sulphurs, and humidity in humidity.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- The envious, O Acsubofen, have uttered something like unto this! Tell us, therefore, what is this humidity?</p>\n<p>And he:- Humidity is a venom, and when venom penetrates a body, it tinges it with an invariable colour, and in no wise permits the soul to be separated from the body, because it is equal thereto. Concerning this, the envious have said: When one flies and the other pursues, then one seizes upon the other, and afterwards they no longer flee, because Nature has laid hold of its equal, after the manner of an enemy, and they destroy one another. For this reason, out of the sulphureous mixed sulphur is produced a most precious colour, which varies not, nor flees from the fire, when the soul enters into the interior of the body and holds the body together and tinges it. I will repeat my words in Tyrian dye. Take the Animal which is called Kenckel, since all its water is a Tyrian colour, and rule the same with a gentle fire, as is customary, until it shall become earth, in which there will be a little colour. But if you wish to obtain the Tyrian tincture, take the humidity which that thing has ejected, and place it therewith gradually in a vessel, adding that tincture whereof the colour was disagreeable to you. Then cook with that same marine water until it shall become dry. Afterwards moisten with that humour, dry gradually, and cease not to imbue it, to cook, and to dry, until it be imbued with all its humour. Then leave it for several days in its own vessel, Until the most precious Tyrian colour shall come out from it to the surface. Observe how I describe the regimen to you! Prepare it with the urine of boys, with water of the sea, and with permanent clean water, so that it may be tinged, and decoct with a gentle fire, until the blackness altogether shall depart from it, and it be easily pounded. Decoct, therefore, in its own humour until it clothe itself with a red colour. But if ye wish to bring it to the Tyrian colour, imbue the same with continual water, and mix, as ye know to be sufficient, according to the rule of sight; mix the same with permanent water sufficiently, and decoct until rust absorb the water. Then wash with the water of the sea which thou hast prepared, which is water of desiccated calx; cook until it imbibe its own moisture; and do this day by day. I tell you that a colour will thence appear to you the like of which the Tyrians have never made. And if ye wish that it should be a still more exalted colour, place the gum in the permanent water, with which ye shall dye it alternately, and afterwards desiccate in the sun. Then restore to the aforesaid water and the black Tyrian colour is intensified. But know that ye do not tinge the purple colour except by cold. Take, therefore, water which is of the nature of cold, and steep wool therein until it extract the force of the tincture from the water. Know also that the Philosophers have called the force which proceeds from that water the Flower. Seek, therefore, your intent in the said water; therein place what is in the vessel for days and nights, until it be clothed with a most precious Tyrian colour.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fifteenth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Fifteenth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fifteenth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Frictes saith:- O all ye seekers after Wisdom, know that the foundation of this Art, on account of which many have perished, is one only.

But for us it is a thing which we reverence. Woe unto all ye fools! How ignorant are ye of this Art, for which ye would die if ye knew it! I swear to you that if kings were familiar with it, none of us would ever attain this thing. O how this nature changeth body into spirit! O how admirable is Nature, how she presides over all, and overcomes all!</p>\n<p>Pythagoras saith:- Name this Nature, O Frictes!</p>\n<p>And he:- It is a very sharp vinegar, which makes gold into sheer spirit, without which vinegar, neither whiteness, nor blackness, nor redness, nor rust can be made. And know ye that when it is mixed with the body, it is contained therein, and becomes one therewith; it turns the same into a spirit, and tinges with a spiritual and invariable tincture, which is indelible. Know, also, that if ye place the body over the fire without vinegar, it will be burnt and corrupted. And know, further, that the first humour is cold. Be careful, therefore, of the fire, which is inimical to cold. Accordingly, the Wise have said: &quot;Rule gently until the sulphur becomes incombustible.&quot; The Wise men have already shewn to those who possess reason the disposition of this Art, and the best point of their Art, which they mentioned, is, that a little of this sulphur burns a strong body. Accordingly they venerate it and name it in the beginning of their book, and the son of Adam thus described it. For this vinegar burns the body, converts it into a cinder, and also whitens the body, which, if ye cook well and deprive of blackness, is changed into a stone, so that it becomes a coin of most intense whiteness. Cook, therefore, the stone until it be disintegrated, and then dissolve and temper with water of the sea. Know also, that the beginning of the whole work is the whitening, to which succeeds the redness, finally the perfection of the work; but after this, by means of vinegar, and by the will of Gcd, there follows a complete perfection, Now, I have shewn to you, O disciples of this Turba, the disposition of the one thing, which is more perfect, more precious, and more honourable, than all natures, and I swear to you by God that I have searched for a long time in books so that I might arrive at the knowledge of this one thing, while I prayed also to God that he would teach me what it is.

Have ye not seen how thrice-great Hermes infused the red into the body, and it was changed into an invariable colour? Know, therefore, that the first virtue is vinegar, and the second is the Lead of which the Wise have spoken, which if it be infused into all bodies, renders all unchangeable, and tinges them with an invariable colour. Take, therefore, Lead which is made out of the stone called Kuhul; let it be of the best quality, and let it be cooked till it becomes black. Then pound the same with Water of Nitre until it is thick like grease, and cook again in a very bright fire until the spissitude of the body is destroyed, the water being rejected. Kindle, therefore, above it until the stone becomes clean, abounding in precious metal, and exceedingly white. Pound it afterwards with dew and the sun, and with sea and rain water for 31 days, for 10 days with salt water, and 10 days with fresh water, when ye shall find the same like to a metallic stone. Cook the same once more with water of nitre until it become tin by liquefaction. Again cook until it be deprived of moisture, and become dry. But know that when it becomes dry it drinks up what remains of its humour swiftly, because it is burnt lead. Take care, however, lest it be burnt. Thus we call it incombustible sulphur. Pound the same with the sharpest vinegar, and cook till it becomes thick, taking care lest the vinegar be changed into smoke and perish; continue this coction for 150 days. Now, therefore, I have demonstrated the disposition of the white lead, all which afterwards follows being no more than women's work and child's play. Know, also, that the arcanum of the work of gold proceeds out of the male and the female, but I have shewn you the male in the lead, while, in like manner, I have discovered for you the female in orpiment. Mix, therefore, the orpiment with the lead, for the female rejoices in receiving the strength of the male, because she is assisted by the male. But the male receives a tingeing spirit from the female. Mix them, therefore, together, place in a glass vessel, and pound with Ethelia and very sharp vinegar; cook for seven days, taking care lest the arcanum smoke away, and leave throughout the night. But if ye wish it to put on mud (colour), seeing that it is already dry, again imbue with vinegar. Now, therefore, I have notified to you the power of orpiment, which is the woman by whom is accomplished the most great arcanum. Do not shew these unto the evil, for they will laugh. It is the Ethelia of vinegar which is placed in the preparation, by which things God perfects the work, whereby also spirits take possession of bodies, and they become spiritual.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-seventeenth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Seventeenth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-seventeenth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Zimon saith:- O Turba of Philosophers and disciples, now hast thou spoken about making into white, but it yet remains to treat concerning the reddening! Know, all ye seekers after this Art, that unless ye whiten, ye cannot make red, because the two natures are nothing other than red and white. Whiten, therefore, the red, and redden the white! Know, also, that the year is divided into four seasons; the first season is of a frigid complexion, and this is Winter; the second is of the complexion of air, and this is Spring; then follows the third, which is summer, and is of the complexion of fire; lastly, there is the fourth, wherein fruits are matured, which is Autumn. In this manner, therefore, ye are to rule your natures, namely, to dissolve ill winter, to cook in spring, to coagulate in summer, and to gather and tinge the fruit in autumn. Having, therefore, given this example, rule the tingeing natures, but if ye err, blame no one save yourselves.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Thou hast treated the matter extremely well; add, therefore, another teaching of this kind for the sake of posterity.</p>\n<p>And he:- I will speak of making lead red. Take the copper which the Master ordered you to take at the beginning of his book, combine lead therewith, and cook it until it becomes thick; congeal also and desiccate until it becomes red. Here certainly is the Red Lead of which the wise spake; copper and lead become a precious stone; mix them equally, let gold be roasted with them, for this, if ye rule well, becomes a tingeing spirit in spirits. So when the male and the female are conjoined there is not produced a volatile wife, but a spiritual composite. From the composite turned into a red spirit is produced the beginning of the world. Behold this is the lead which we have called Red Lead, which is of our work, and without which nothing is effected!</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-eighteenth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Eighteenth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-eighteenth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Mundus saith to the Turba:- The seekers after this Art must know that the Philosophers in their books have described gum in many ways, but it is none other than permanent water, out of which our precious stone is generated. O how many are the seekers after this gum, and how few there are who find it! Know that this gum is not ameliorated except by gold alone. For there be very many who investigate these applications, and they find certain things, yet they cannot sustain the labours because they are diminished. But the applications which are made out of the gum and out of the honourable stone, which has already held the tincture, they sustain the labours, and are never diminished. Understand, therefore, my words, for I will explain unto you the applications of this gum, and the arcanum existing therein. Know ye that our gum is stronger than gold, and all those who know it do hold it more honourable than gold, yet gold we also honour, for without it the gum cannot be improved. Our gum, therefore, is for Philosophers more precious and more sublime than pearls, because out of gum with a little gold we buy much. Consequently, the Philosophers, when committing these things to writing that the same might not perish, have not set forth in their books the manifest disposition, lest every one should become acquainted therewith, and having become familiar to fools, the same would not sell it at a small price. Take, therefore, one part of the most intense white gum; one part of the urine of a white calf; one part of the gall of a fish; and one part of the body of gum, without which it cannot be improved; mix these portions and cook for forty days. When these things have been done, congeal by the heat of the sun till they are dried. Then cook the same, mixed with milk of ferment, until the milk fail; afterwards extract it, and until it become dry evaporate the moisture by heat. Then mix it with milk of the fig, and cook it till that moisture be dried up in the composite, which afterwards mix with milk of the root of grass, and again cook until it be dry. Then moisten it with rainwater, then sprinkle with water of dew, and cook until it be dried. Also imbue with permanent water, and desiccate until it become of the most intense dryness. Having done these things: mix the same with the gum which is equipped with all manner of colours, and cook strongly until the whole force of the water perish; and the entire body be deprived of its humidity, while ye imbue the same by cooking, until the dryness thereof be kindled. Then dismiss for forty days. Let it remain in that trituration or decocting until the spirit penetrate the body. For by this regimen the spirit is made corporeal, and the body is changed into a spirit. Observe the vessel, therefore, lest the composition fly and pass off in fumes. These things being accomplished, open the vessel, and ye will find that which ye purposed.

He, therefore, who does not understand Permanent Water, and its indispensable regimen, may not enter into this Art, because nothing is effected without the Permanent Water. The force thereof is a spiritual blood, whence the Philosophers have called it Permanent Water, for, having pounded it with the body, as the Masters before me have explained to you, by the will of God it turns that body into spirit.

Howsoever, I teach posterity that this despised stone is a permanent water, and know, all ye seekers after Wisdom, that permanent water is water of mundane life, because, verily, Philosophers have stated that Nature rejoices in Nature, Nature contains Nature, and Nature overcomes Nature. The Philosophers have constituted this short dictum the principle of the work for reasonable persons. And know ye that no body is more precious or purer than the Sun, and that no tingeing venom: is generated without the Sun and its shadow. He, therefore, who attempts to make the venom of the Philosophers without these, already errs, and has fallen into that pit wherein his sadness remains. But he who has tinged the venom of the wise out of the Sun and its shadow has arrived at the highest Arcanum. Know also that our coin when it becomes red, is called gold; he, therefore, who knows the hidden Cambar of the Philosophers, to him is the Arcanum already revealed.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Thou hast even now intelligibly described this stone, yet thou hast not narrated its regimen nor its composition. Return, therefore, to the description.</p>\n<p>He saith:- I direct you to take an occult and honourable arcanum, which is White Magnesia, and the same is mixed and pounded with wine, but take care not to make use of this except it be pure and clean; finally place it in its vessel, and pray God that He may grant you the sight of this very great stone. Then cook gradually, and, extracting, see if it has become a black stone, in which case ye have ruled excellently well. But rule it thus for the white, which is a great arcanum, until it becomes Kuhul, closed up with blackness, which blackness see that it does not remain longer than forty days. Pound the same, therefore, with its confections, which are the said flower of copper, gold of the Indies whose root is one, and a certain extract of an unguent, that is, of a crocus, that is, fixed exalted alum; cook the four, therefore, permanently for 40 or 42 days. After these days God will show you the principle(or beginning) of this stone, which is the stone Atitos, of which favoured sight of God there are many accounts. Cook strongly, and imbue with the gum that remains. And know ye that so often as ye imbue the cinder, so often must it be desiccated and again humectated, until its colour turns into that which ye desire. Now, therefore, will I complete that which I have begun, if God will look kindly on us. Know also that the perfection of the work of this precious stone is to rule it with the residue of the third part of the medicine, and to preserve the two other parts for imbuing and cooking alternately till the required colour appears. Let the fire be more intense than the former; let the matter be cerated, and when it is desiccated it coheres. Cook, therefore, the wax until it imbibes the gluten of gold, which being desiccated, imbue the rest of the work seven times until the other two thirds be finished, and true earth imbibe them all. Finally, place the same on a hot fire until the earth extract its flower and be satisfactory. Blessed are ye if ye understand! But, if not, I will repeat to you the perfection of the work.

For that which they have concealed is more sublime and obscure than it is possible to make known in words, and albeit some have dealt with it intelligibly and well, certain others have treated it obscurely; thus some are more lucid than others.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth: Thou hast truly spoken.</p>\n<p>And he:- I announce to posterity that between boritis and copper there is an affinity, because the boritis of the Wise liquefies; the copper, and it changes as a fluxible water.

Lastly, cook it continuously until it be congealed. For when it is congealed it becomes a very great arcanum. Accordingly, the Philosophers have called this stone Boritis; cook, therefore, that coagulated stone until it becomes a matter like mucra. Then imbue it with the Permanent water which I directed you to reserve, that is to say, with the other portion, and cook it many times until its colours manifest. This, therefore, is the very great putrefaction which extracts (or contains in itself) the very great arcanum.</p>\n<p>Saith the Turba:- Return to thine exposition, O Theophilus!</p>\n<p>And he:- It is to be known that the same affinity which exists between the magnet and iron, also exists assuredly between copper and permanent water. If, therefore, ye rule copper and permanent water as I have directed, there will thence result the very great arcanum in the following fashion. Take white Magnesia and quicksilver, mix with the male, and pound strongly by cooking, not with the hands, until the water become thin. But dividing this water into two parts, in the one part of the water cook it for eleven, otherwise, forty days, until there be a white flower, as the flower of salt in its splendour and coruscation: but strongly close the mouth of the vessel, and cook for forty days, when ye will find it water whiter than milk; deprive it of all blackness by cooking; continue the cooking until its whole nature be disintegrated, until the defilement perish, until it be found clean, and is wholly broken up (or becomes wholly clean). But if ye wish that the whole arcanum, which I have given you, be accomplished, wash the same with water, that is to say, the other part which I counselled you to preserve, until there appear a crocus, and leave in its own vessel. For the Iksir pounds (or contains) itself; imbue also with the residue of the water, until by decoction and by water it be pounded and become like a syrup of pomegranates; imbue it, therefore, and cook, until the weight of the humidity shall fail, and the colour which the Philosophers have magnified shall truly appear.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-twenty-third-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Twenty-third Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-twenty-third-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Cerus saith:- Understand, all ye Sons of the Doctrine, that which Theophilus hath told you, namely, that there exists an affinity between the magnet and the iron, by the alliance of composite existing between the magnet and the iron, while the copper is fitly ruled for one hundred days: what statement can be more useful to you than that there is no affinity between tin and quicksilver!</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Thou hast ill spoken, having disparaged the true disposition.</p>\n<p>And he:- I testify that I say nothing but what is true why are you incensed against me Fear the Lord, all ye Turba, that you Master may believe you!</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Say what you will.</p>\n<p>And he:- I direct you to take quicksilver, in which is the male potency or strength; cook the same with its body until it becomes a fluxible water; cook the masculine together with the vapour, until each shall be coagulated and become a stone.

For thou hast illuminated thy words.</p>\n<p>And they:- It is said because thou praisest him for his sayings, do not be inferior to him.</p>\n<p>And he:- I know that I can utter nothing but that which he hath uttered; however, I counsel posterity to make bodies not bodies, but these incorporeal things bodies. For by this regimen the composite is prepared, and the hidden part of its nature is extracted. With these bodies accordingly join quicksilver and the body of Magnesia, the woman also with the man, and by means of this there is extracted our secret Ethelia, through which bodies are coloured; assuredly, if I understand this regimen, bodies become not bodies, and incorporeal things become bodies. If ye diligently pound the things in the fire and digest (or join to) the Ethelias, they become clean and fixed things. And know ye that quicksilver is a fire burning the bodies, mortifying and breaking up, with one regimen, and the more it is mixed and pounded with the body, the more the body is disintegrated, while the quicksilver is attenuated and becomes living. For when ye shall diligently pound fiery quicksilver and cook it as required, ye will possess Ethel, a fixed nature and colour, subject to every tincture, which also overcomes, breaks, and constrains the fire. For this reason it does not colour things unless it be coloured, and being coloured it colours. And know that no body can tinge itself unless its spirit be extracted from the secret belly thereof, when it becomes a body and soul without the spirit, which is a spiritual tincture, out of which colours have manifested, seeing that a dense thing does not tinge a tenuous, but a tenuous nature colours that which enters into a body. When, however, ye have ruled the body of copper, and have extracted from it a most tenuous (subject), then the latter is changed into a tincture by which it is coloured. Hence has the wise man said, that copper does not tinge unless first it be tinged. And know that those four bodies which you are directed to rule are this copper, and that the tinctures which I have signified unto you are the condensed and the humid, but the condensed is a conjoined vapour, and the humid is the water of sulphur, for sulphurs are contained by sulphurs, and rightly by these things Nature rejoices in Nature, and overcomes, and constrains.</p>\n<p>The Twenty-Sixth Dictum.</p>\n<p>Zenon saith:- I perceive that you, O crowd of the Wise, have conjoined two bodies, which your Master by no means ordered you to do!</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Inform us according to your own opinion, O Zenon, in this matter, and beware of envy! Then he:- Know that the colours which shall appear to you out of it are these. Know, O Sons of the Doctrine, that it behoves you to allow the composition to putrefy for forty days, and then to sublimate five times in a vessel. Next join to a fire of dung, and cook, when these colours shall appear to you: On the first day black citrine, on the second black red, on the third like unto a dry crocus, finally, the purple colour will appear to you; the ferment and the coin of the vulgar shall be imposed; then is the Ixir composed out of the humid and the dry, and then it tinges with an invariable tincture. Know also that it is called a body wherein there is gold. But when ye are composing the Ixir, beware lest you extract the same hastily, for it lingers. Extract, therefore, the same as an Ixir. For this venom is, as it were, birth and life, because it is a soul extracted out of many things, and imposed upon coins: its tincture, therefore, is life to those things with which it is joined, from which it removes evil, but it is death to the bodies from which it is extracted. Accordingly, the Masters have said that between them there exists the same desire as between male and female, and if any one, being introduced to this Art, should know these natures, he would sustain the tediousness of cooking until he gained his purpose according to the will of God.</p>\n<p>The Twenty-Seventh Dictum.</p>\n<p>Gregorius saith:- O all ye Turba, it is to be observed that the envious have called the venerable stone Efflucidinus, and they have ordered it to be ruled until it coruscates like marble in its splendour.</p>\n<p>And they:- Show, therefore, what it is to posterity.</p>\n<p>Then he:- Willingly; you must know that the copper is commingled with vinegar, and ruled until it becomes water. Finally, let it be congealed, and it remains a coruscating stone with a brilliancy like marble, which, when ye see thus, I direct you to rule until it becomes red, because when it is cooked till it is disintegrated and becomes earth, it is turned into a red colour. When ye see it thus, repeatedly cook and imbue it until it assume the aforesaid colour, and it shall become hidden gold. Then repeat the process, when it will become gold of a Tyrian colour. It behoves you, therefore, O all ye investigators of this Art, when ye have observed that this Stone is coruscating, to pound and turn it into earth, until it acquires some degree of redness; then take the remainder of the water which the envious ordered you to divide into two parts, and ye shall imbibe them several times until the colours which are hidden by no body appear unto you. Know also that if ye rule it ignorantly, ye shall see nothing of those colours. I knew a certain person who commenced this work, and operated the natures of truth, who, when the redness was somewhat slow in appearing, imagined that he had made a mistake, and so relinquished the work. Observe, therefore, how ye make the conjunction, for the punic dye, having embraced his spouse, passes swiftly into her body, liquefies, congeals, breaks up, and disintegrates the same. Finally, the redness does not delay in coming, and if ye effect it without the weight, death will take place, whereupon it will be thought to be bad. Hence, I order that the fire should be gentle in liquefaction, but when it is turned to earth make the same intense, and imbue it until God shall extract the colours for us and they appear.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-twenty-eighth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Twenty-Eighth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-twenty-eighth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Custos saith:- I am surprised, O all ye Turba! at the very great force and nature of this water, for when it has entered into the said body, it turns it first into earth, and next into powder, to test the perfection of which take in the hand, and if ye find it impalpable as water, it is then most excellent; otherwise, repeat the cooking until it is brought to the required condition.

These things being done, God will restore unto it both the soul and the spirit thereof, and the weakness being taken away, that matter will be made strong, and after corruption will be improved, even as a man becomes stronger after resurrection and younger than he was in this world. Therefore it behoves you, O ye Sons of the Doctrine, to consume that matter with fire boldly until it shall become a cinder, when know that ye have mixed it excellently well, for that cinder receives the spirit, and is imbued with the humour until it assumes a fairer colour than it previously possessed. Consider, therefore, O ye Sons of the Doctrine, that artists are unable to paint with their own tinctures until they convert them into a powder; similarly, the philosophers cannot combine medicines for the sick slaves until they also turn them into powder, cooking some of them to a cinder, while others they grind with their hands. The case is the same with those who compose the images of the ancients. But if ye understand what has already been said, ye will know that I speak the truth, and hence I have ordered you to burn up the body and turn it into a cinder, for if ye rule it subtly many things will proceed from it, even as much proceeds from the smallest things in the world. It is thus because copper like man, has a body and a soul, for the inspiration of men cometh from the air, which after God is their life, and similarly the copper is inspired by the humour from which that same copper receiving strength is multiplied and augmented like other things. Hence, the philosophers add, that when copper is consumed with fire and iterated several times, it becomes better than it was.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Show, therefore, O Bonellus, to future generations after what manner it becometh better than it was!</p>\n<p>And he:- I will do so willingly; it is because it is augmented and multiplied, and because God extracts many things out of one thing, since He hath created nothing which wants its own regimen, and those qualities by which its healing must be effected. Similarly, our copper, when it is first cooked, becomes water; then the more it is cooked, the more is it thickened until it becomes a stone, as the envious have termed it, but it is really an egg tending to become a metal. It is afterwards broken and imbued, when ye must roast it in a fire more intense than the former, until it shall be coloured and shall become like blood in combustion, when it is placed on coins and changes them into gold, according to the Divine pleasure. Do you not see that sperm is not produced from the blood unless it be diligently cooked in the liver till it has acquired an intense red colour, after which no change takes place in that sperm? It is the same with our work, for unless it be cooked diligently until it shall become a powder, and afterwards be putrefied until it shall become a spiritual sperm, there will in no wise proceed from it that colour which ye desire.

Nothing else has led you into error but the sayings of the envious, because what ye seek is sold at the smallest possible price. If men knew this, and how great was the thing they held in their hands, they would in no wise sell it. Therefore, the Philosophers have glorified that venom, have treated of it variously, and in many ways, have taken and applied to it all manner of names, wherefore, certain envious persons have said: It is a stone and not a stone, but a gum of Ascotia, consequently, the Philosophers have concealed the power thereof. For this spirit which ye seek, that ye may tinge therewith, is concealed in the body, and hidden away from sight, even as the soul in the human body. But ye seekers after the Art, unless ye disintegrate this body, imbue and pound both cautiously and diligently, until ye extract it from its grossness (or grease), and turn it into a tenuous and impalpable spirit, have your labour in vain. Wherefore the Philosophers have said: Except ye turn bodies into not bodies, and incorporeal things into bodies, ye have not yet discovered the rule of operation.</p>\n<p>But the Turba saith:- Tell, therefore, posterity how bodies are turned into not-bodies.</p>\n<p>And he:- They are pounded with fire and Ethelia till they become a powder. And know that this does not take place except by an exceedingly strong decoction, and continuous contrition, performed with a moderate fire, not with hands, with imbibition and putrefaction, with exposure to the sun and to Ethelia. The envious caused the vulgar to err in this Art when they stated that the thing is common in its nature and is sold at a small price. They further said that the nature was more precious than all natures, wherefore they deceived those who had recourse to their books. At the same time they spoke the truth, and therefore doubt not these things.</p>\n<p>But the Turba answereth:- Seeing that thou believest the sayings of the envious, explain, therefore, to posterity the disposition of the two natures.</p>\n<p>And he:- I testify to you that Art requires two natures, for the precious is not produced without the common, nor the common without the precious. It behoves you, therefore, O all ye Investigators of this Art, to follow the sayings of Victimerus, when he said to his disciples: Nothing else helps you save to sublimate water and vapour.</p>\n<p>And the Turba:- The whole work is in the vapour and the sublimation of water. Demonstrate, therefore, to them the disposition of the vapour.</p>\n<p>And he:- When ye shall perceive that the natures have become water by reason of the heat of the fire, and that they have been purified, and that the whole body of Magnesia is liquefied as water; then all things have been made vapour, and rightly, for then the vapour contains its own equal, wherefore the envious call either vapour, because both are joined in decoctions, and one contains the other. Thus our stag finds no path to escape, although flight be essential to it. The one keeps back the other, so that it has no opportunity to fly, and it finds no place to escape; hence all are made permanent, for when the one falls, being hidden in the body, it is congealed with it, and its colour varies, and it extracts its nature from the properties which God has infused into His elect, and it alienates it, lest it flee. But the blackness and redness appear, and it falls into sickness, and dies by rust and putrefaction; properly speaking, then, it has not a flight, although it is desirous to escape servitude; then when it is free it follows its spouse, that a favourable colour may befall itself and its spouse; its beauty is not as it was, but when it is placed with coins, it makes them gold. For this reason, therefore, the Philosophers have called the spirit and the soul vapour. They have also called it the black humid wanting perlution; and forasmuch as in man there are both humidity and dryness, thus our work, which the envious have concealed, is nothing else but vapour and water.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Demonstrate vapour and water!</p>\n<p>And he:- I say that the work is out of two; the envious have called it composed out of two, because these two become four, wherein are dryness and humidity, spirit and vapour.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Thou hast spoken excellently, and without envy.

Know further, that the nature and humidity become water, then a stone, if ye cause them to be well complexionated, and if ye are acquainted with the natures, because the part which is light and spiritual rises to the top, but that which is thick and heavy remains below in the vessel. Now this is the contrition of the Philosophers, namely, that which is not sublimated sinks down, but that which becomes a spiritual powder rises to the top of the vessel, and this is the contrition of decoction, not of hands. Know also, that unless ye have turned all into powder, ye have not yet pounded them completely. Cook them, therefore, successively until they become converted, and a powder. Wherefore Agadaimon saith:- Cook the copper until it become a gentle and impalpable body, and impose in its own vessel; then sublimate the same six or seven times until the water shall descend. And know that when the water has become powder then has it been ground diligently. But if ye ask, how is the water made a powder? note that the intention of the Philosophers is that the body before which before it falls into the water is not water may become water; the said water is mixed with the other water, and they become one water. It is to be stated, therefore, that unless ye turn the thing mentioned into water, ye shall not attain to the work. It is, therefore, necessary for the body to be so possessed by the flame of the fire that it is disintegrated and becomes weak with the water, when the water has been added to the water, until the whole becomes water. But fools, hearing of water, think that this is water of the clouds. Had they read our books they would know that it is permanent water, which cannot become permanent without its companion, wherewith it is made one. But this is the water which the Philosophers have called Water of Gold, the Igneous, Good Venom, and that Sand of Many Names which Hermes ordered to be washed frequently, so that the blackness of the Sun might be removed, which he introduced in the solution of the body. And know, all ye seekers after this Art, that unless ye take this pure body, that is, our copper without the spirit, ye will by no means see what ye desire, because no foreign thing enters therein, nor does anything enter unless it be pure. Therefore, all ye seekers after this Art, dismiss the multitude of obscure names, for the nature is one water; if anyone err, he draws nigh to destruction, and loses his life. Therefore, keep this one nature, but dismiss what is foreign.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-thirty-seventh-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Thirty-Seventh Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-thirty-seventh-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Bonellus saith:- I will speak a little concerning Magnesia.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Speak.</p>\n<p>And he:- O all ye Sons of the Doctrine, when mixing Magnesia, place it in its vessel, the mouth of which close carefully, and cook with a gentle fire until it liquefy, and all become water therein! For the heat of the water acting thereupon, it becomes water by the will of God. When ye see that the said water is about to become black, ye know that the body is already liquefied. Place again in its vessel, and cook for forty days, until it drink up the moisture of the vinegar and honey. But certain persons uncover it, say, once in each week, or once in every ten nights; in either case, the ultimate perfection of pure water appears at the end of forty days, for then it completely absorbs the humour of the decoction. Therefore, wash the same, and deprive of its blackness, until, the blackness being removed, the stone becomes dry to the touch. Hence the envious have said:- Wash the Magnesia with soft water, and cook diligently, until it become earth, and the humour perish. Then it is called copper. Subsequently, pour very sharp vinegar upon it, and leave it to be soaked therein. But this is our copper, which the Philosophers have ordained should be washed with permanent water, wherefore they have said: Let the venom be divided into two parts, with one of which burn up the body, and with the other putrefy. And know, all ye seekers after this Science, that the whole work and regimen does not take place except by water, wherefore, they say that the thing which ye seek is one, and, unless that which improves it be present in the said thing, what ye look for shall in no wise take place. Therefore, it behoves you to add those .things which are needful, that ye may thereby obtain that which you purpose.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Thou has spoken excellently, O Bonellus! If it please thee, therefore, finish that which thou art saying; otherwise repeat it a second time.</p>\n<p>But he:- Shall I indeed repeat these and like things? O all ye investigators of this Art, take our copper; place with the first part of the water in the vessel; cook for forty days; purify from all uncleanliness; cook further until its days be accomplished, and it become a stone having no moisture. Then cook until nothing remains except faeces. This done, cleanse seven times, wash with water, and when the water is used up leave it to putrefy in its vessel, so long as may seem desirable to your purpose. But the envious called this composition when it is turned into blackness that which is sufficiently black, and have said: Rule the same with vinegar and nitre. But that which remained when it had been whitened they called sufficiently white, and ordained that it should be ruled with permanent water. Again, when they called the same sufficiently red, they ordained that it should be ruled with water and fire until it became red.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Show forth unto posterity what they intended by these things.</p>\n<p>And he:- They called it Ixir satis, by reason of the variation of its colours. In the work, however, there is neither variety, multiplicity, nor opposition of substances; it is necessary only to make the black copper white and then red. However, the truth-speaking Philosophers had no other intention than that of liquefying, pounding, and cooking Ixir until the stone should become like unto marble in its splendour. Accordingly, the envious again said: Cook the same with vapour until the stone becomes coruscating by reason of its brilliancy. But when ye see it thus, it is, indeed, the most great Arcanum. Notwithstanding, ye must then pound and wash it seven times with permanent water; finally, again pound and congeal in its own water, until ye extract its own concealed nature. Wherefore, saith Maria, sulphurs are contained in sulphurs, but humour in like humour, and out of sulphur mixed with sulphur, there comes forth a great work. But I ordain that you rule the same with dew and the sun, until your purpose appear to you. For I signify unto you that there are two kinds of whitening and of making red, of which one consists in rust and the other in contrition and decoction. But ye do not need any contrition of hands. Beware, however, of making a separation from the waters lest the poisons get at You, and the body perish with the other things which are in the vessel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-thirty-eighth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Thirty-Eighth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-thirty-eighth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Effistus saith:- Thou hast spoken most excellently, O Bonellus, and I bear witness to all thy words!</p>\n<p>The Turba saith:- Tell us if there be any service in the speech of Bonellus, so that those initiated in this disposition may be more bold and certain.</p>\n<p>Effistus saith:- Consider, all ye investigators of this Art, how Hermes, chief of the Philosophers, spoke and demonstrated when he wished to mix the natures. Take, he tells us, the stone of gold, combine with humour which is permanent water, set in its vessel, over a gentle fire until liquefaction takes place. Then leave it until the water dries, and the sand and water are combined, one with another; then let the fire be more intense than before, until it again becomes dry, and is made earth. When this is done, understand that here is the beginning of the arcanum; but do this many times, until two-thirds of the water perish, and colours manifest unto you.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Thou hast spoken excellently, O Effistus! Yet, briefly inform us further.</p>\n<p>And he:- I testify to Posterity that the dealbation doth not take place save by decoction. Consequently, Agadaimon has very properly treated of cooking, of pounding, and of imbuing, ethelia. Yet I direct you not to pour on the whole of the water at one time, lest the Ixir be submerged, but pour it in gradually, pound and dessicate, and do this several times until the water be exhausted. Now concerning this the envious have said: Leave the water when it has all been poured in, and it will sink to the bottom. But their intention is this, that while the humour is drying, and when it has been turned into powder, leave it in its glass vessel for forty days, until it passes through various colours, which the Philosophers have described. By this method of cooking the bodies put on their spirits and spiritual tinctures, and become warm.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Thou hast given light to us, O Effistus, and hast done excellently!

He, therefore, who is willing to Persevere in this disposition, and would enjoy the result, may enter upon it, but he who desires to learn over speedily, must not have recourse to our books, for they impose great labour before they are read in their higher sense, once, twice, or thrice. Therefore, the Master saith:- Whosoever bends his back over the study of our books, devoting his leisure thereto, is not occupied with vain thoughts, but fears God, and shall reign in the Kingdom without fail until he die. For what ye seek is not of small price. Woe unto you who seek the very great and compensating treasure of God! Know ye not that for the smallest Purpose in the world, earthly men will give themselves to death, and what, therefore, ought they to do for this most excellent and almost impossible offering? Now, the regimen is greater than is perceived by reason, except through divine inspiration. I once met with a person who was as well acquainted with the elements as I myself, but when he proceeded to rule this disposition, he attained not to the joy thereof by reason of his sadness and ignorance in ruling, and excessive eagerness, desire, and haste concerning the purpose. Woe unto you, sons of the Doctrine! For one who plants trees does not look for fruit, save in due season; he also who sows seeds does not expect to reap, except at harvest time. How, then, should ye desire to attain this offering when ye have read but a single book, or have adventured only the first regimen? But the Philosophers have plainly stated that the truth is not to be discerned except after error, and nothing creates greater pain at heart than error in this Art, while each imagines that he has almost the whole world, and yet finds nothing in his hands. Woe unto you! Understand the dictum of the Philosopher, and how he divided the work when he said- pound, cook, reiterate, and be thou not weary. But when thus he divided the work, he signified commingling, cooking, assimilating, roasting, heating, whitening, pounding, cooking Ethelia, making rust or redness, and tingeing. Here, therefore, are there many names, and yet there is one regimen. And if men knew that one decoction and one contrition would suffice them, they would not so often repeat their words, as they have done, and in order that the mixed body may be pounded and cooked diligently, have admonished you not to be weary thereof. Having darkened the matter to you with their words, it suffices me to speak in this manner. It is needful to complexionate the venom rightly, then cook many times, and do not grow tired of the decoction. Imbue and cook it until it shall become as I have ordained that it should be ruled by you- namely, impalpable spirits, and until ye perceive that the Ixir is clad in the garment of the Kingdom. For when ye behold the Ixir turned into Tyrian colour, then have ye found that which the Philosophers discovered before you. If ye understand my words (and although my words be dead, yet is there life therein for those who understand themselves), they will forthwith explain any ambiguity occurring herein. Read, therefore, repeatedly, for reading is a dead speech, but that which is uttered with the lips the same is living speech. Hence we have ordered you to read frequently, and, moreover, ponder diligently over the things which we have narrated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fortieth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Fortieth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fortieth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Jargus saith:- Thou hast left obscure a part of thy discourse, O Bacsen!</p>\n<p>And he:- Do thou, therefore, Jargus, in thy clemency shew forth the same!</p>\n<p>And he answereth:- The copper of which thou hast before spoken is not copper, nor is it the tin of the vulgar; it is our true work (or body) which must be combined with the body of Magnesia, that it may be cooked and pounded without wearying until the stone is made. Afterwards, that stone must be pounded in its vessel with the water of nitre, and, subsequently, placed in liquefaction until it is destroyed.

But conjoin the male to the female, which are vapour and quicksilver, until the male and the female become Ethel, for he who changes them into spirit by means of Ethel, and next makes them red, tinges every body, because, when by diligent cooking ye pound the body, ye extract a pure, spiritual, and sublime soul therefrom, which tinges every body.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Inform, therefore, posterity what is that body.</p>\n<p>And he:- It is a natural sulphureous thing which is called by the names of all bodies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-forty-third-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Forty-Third Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-forty-third-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Dardaris saith:- Ye have frequently treated of the regimen, and have introduced the conjunction, yet I proclaim to posterity that they cannot extract the now hidden soul except by Ethelia, by which bodies become not bodies through continual cooking, and by sublimation of Ethelia.

When, therefore, ye have diligently pounded the bodies, and have exalted them as required, therefrom is produced that Ethel nature, and a colour which is tingeing and not volatile, and it tinges the copper which the Turba said did not tinge until it is tinged, because that which is tinged tinges.

Because it was necessary that one should become tingeing, and that the other should be tinged, for the spirit being separated from the body and hidden in the other spirit, both become volatile. Therefore the Wise have said that the gate of flight must not be opened for that which would flee, (or that which does not flee), by whose flight death is occasioned, for by the conversion of the sulphureous thing into a spirit like unto itself, either becomes volatile, since they are made aeriform spirits prone to ascend in the air. But the Philosophers seeing that which was not volatile made volatile with the volatiles, iterated these to a body like to the non-volatiles, and put them into that from which they could not escape. They iterated them to a body like unto the bodies from which they were extracted, and the same were then digested. But as for the statement of the Philosopher that the tingeing agent and that which is to be tinged are made one tincture, it refers to a spirit concealed in another humid spirit. Know also that one of the humid spirits is cold, but the other is hot, and although the cold humid is not adapted to the warm humid, nevertheless they are made one. Therefore, we prefer these two bodies, because by them we rule the whole work, namely, bodies by not-bodies, until incorporeals become bodies, steadfast in the fire, because they are conjoined with volatiles, which is not possible in any body, these excepted. For spirits in every wise avoid bodies, but fugitives are restrained by incorporeals. Incorporeals, therefore, similarly flee from bodies; those, consequently, which do not flee are better and more precious than all bodies. These things, therefore, being done, take those which are not volatile and join them; wash the body with the incorporeal until the incorporeal receives a non-volatile body; convert the earth into water, water into fire, fire into air, and conceal the fire in the depths of the water, but the earth in the belly of the air, mingling the hot with the humid, and the cold with the dry.

Now I say unto you, all ye Sons of the Doctrine, that unless ye reduce the thing by fire until those things ascend like a spirit, ye effect nought.

It must be known for certain that nothing of the work can be bought, and that the science of this Art is nothing else than vapour and the sublimation of water, with the conjunction, also, of quicksilver in the body of Magnesia; but, heretofore, the Philosophers have demonstrated in their books that the impure water of sulphur is from sulphur only, and no sulphur is produced without the water of its calx, and of quicksilver, and of sulphur.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-forty-ninth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Forty-Ninth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-forty-ninth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Belus saith:- O all ye Philosophers, ye have not dealt sparingly concerning composition and contact, but cornposition, contact, and congelation are one thing!

When the same has been sublimed, there proceeds from the Cambar that quicksilver which is called Ethelia, Orpiment, Zendrio, or Sanderich, Ebsemich, Magnesia, Kuhul, or Chuhul, and many other names. Concerning this, philosophers have said that, being ruled by its regimen (for ten is the perfection of all things), its white nature appears, nor is there any shadow therein. Then the envious have called it lead from Ebmich, Magnesia, Marteck, White Copper. For, when truly whitened, it is devoid of shadow and blackness, it has left its thickened ponderous bodies, and therewith a clean humid spirit has ascended, which spirit is tincture. Accordingly, the wise have said that copper has a soul and a body. Now, its soul is spirit, and its body is thick.

For it behoves you to burn it with its humidity lest its spirit be burnt, and let the vessel be closed on all sides, so that its colour [heat] may be increased, the body of copper be destroyed, and its tingeing spirit be extracted, concerning which the envious have said: Take quicksilver out of the Flower of Copper, which also they have called the water of our copper, a fiery venom, and a substance extracted from all things, which further they have termed Ethelia, extracted out of many things. Again, some have said that when all things become one, bodies are made not-bodies, but not-bodies bodies. And know, all ye investigators of this Art, that every body is dissolved with the spirit with which it is mixed, with which without doubt it becomes a similar spiritual thing, and that every spirit which has a tingeing colour of spirits, and is constant against fire, is altered and coloured by bodies. Blessed then be the name of Him who hath inspired the Wise with the idea of turning a body into a spirit having strength and colour, unalterable and incorruptible, so that what formerly was volatile sulphur is now made sulphur not-volatile, and incombustible! Know, also, all ye sons of learning, that he who is able to make your fugitive spirit red by the body mixed with it, and then from that body and that spirit can extract the tenuous nature hidden in the belly thereof, by a most subtle regimen, tinges every body, if only he is patient in spite of the tedium of extracting. Wherefore the envious have said: Know that out of copper, after it is humectated by the moisture thereof, is pounded in its water, and is cooked in sulphur, if ye extract a body having Ethelia, ye will find that which is suitable as a tincture for anything. Therefore the envious have said: Things that are diligently pounded in the fire, with sublimation of the Ethelia, become fixed tinctures. For whatsoever words ye find in any man's book signify quicksilver, which we call water of sulphur, which also we sometimes say is lead and copper and copulated coin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fifty-second-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Fifty-Second Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fifty-second-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Ixumdrus saith:- You will have treated most excellently, O Horfolcus, concerning the regimen of copper and the humid spirit, provided you proceed therewith.</p>\n<p>And he:- Perfect, therefore, what I have omitted, O Ixumdrus!</p>\n<p>Ixumdrus saith:- You must know that this Ethelia which you have previously mentioned and notified, which also the envious have called by many names, doth whiten, and tinge when it is whitened; then truly the Philosophers have called it the Flower of Gold, because it is a certain natural thing. Do you not remember what the Philosophers have said, that before it arrives at this terminus, copper does not tinge? But when it is tinged it tinges, because quicksilver tinges when it is combined with its tincture. But when it is mixed with those ten things which the Philosophers have denominated fermented urines, then have they called all these things Multiplication. But some have termed their mixed bodies Corsufle and Gum of Gold. Therefore, those names which are found in the books of the Philosophers, and are thought superfluous and vain, are true and yet are fictitious, because they are one thing, one opinion, and one way. This is the quicksilver which is indeed extracted from all things, out of which all things are produced, which also is pure water that destroys the shade of copper. And know ye that this quicksilver, when it is whitened, becomes a sulphur which contains sulphur, and is a venom that has a brilliance like marble; this the envious call Ethelia, orpiment and sandarac, out of which a tincture and pure spirit ascends with a mild fire, and the whole pure flower is sublimated, which flower becomes wholly quicksilver. It is, therefore, a most great arcanum which the Philosophers have thus described, because sulphur alone whitens copper. Ye, O investigators of this Art, must know that the said sulphur cannot whiten copper until it is whitened in the work! And know ye also that it is the habit of this sulphur to escape. When, therefore, it flees from its own thick bodies, and is sublimated as a vapour, then it behoves you to retain it otherwise with quicksilver of its own kind, lest it vanish altogether. Wherefore the Philosophers have said, that sulphurs are contained by sulphurs. Know, further, that sulphurs tinge, and then are they certain to escape unless they are united to quicksilver of its own kind. Do not, therefore, think that because it tinges and afterwards escapes, it is the coin of the Vulgar, for what the Philosophers are seeking is the coin of the Philosophers, which, unless it be mixed with white or red, which is quicksilver of its own kind, would doubtless escape. I direct you, therefore, to mix quicksilver with quicksilver (of its kind) until together they become one clean water composed out of two. This is, therefore, the great arcanum, the confection of which is with its own gum; it is cooked with flowers in a gentle fire and with earth; it is made red with mucra and with vinegar, salt, and nitre, and with mutal is turned into rubigo, or by any of the select tingeing agents existing in our coin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fifty-third-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Fifty-Third Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fifty-third-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Exumenus saith:- The envious have laid waste the whole Art with the multiplicity of names, but the entire work must be the Art of the Coin. For the Philosophers have ordered the doctors of this art to make coin-like gold, which also the same Philosophers have called by all manner of names.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Inform, therefore, posterity, O Exumenus, concerning a few of these names, that they may take warning!</p>\n<p>And he:- They have named it salting, sublimating, washing, and pounding Ethelias, whitening in the fire, frequently cooking vapour and coagulating, turning into rubigo, the confection of Ethel, the art of the water of sulphur and coagula. By all these names is that operation called which has pounded and whitened copper. And know ye, that quicksilver is white to the sight, but when it is possessed by the smoke of sulphur, it reddens and becomes Cambar. Therefore, when quicksilver is cooked with its confections it is turned into red, and hence the Philosopher saith that the nature of lead is swiftly converted. Do you not see that the Philosophers have spoken without envy! Hence we deal in many ways with pounding and reiteration, that ye may extract the spirits existing in the vessel, which the fire did not cease to burn continuously. But the water placed with those things prevents the fire from burning, and it befalls those things that the more they are possessed by the flame of fire, the more they are hidden in the depths of the water, lest they should be injured by the heat of the fire; but the water receives them in its belly and repels the flame of fire from them.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Unless ye make bodies not-bodies ye achieve nothing. But concerning the sublimation of water the Philosophers have treated not a little. And know that unless ye diligently pound the thing in the fire, the Ethelia does not ascend, but when that does not ascend ye achieve nothing. When, however, it ascends it is an instrument for the intended tincture with which ye tinge, and concerning this Ethelia Hermes saith: Sift the things which ye know; but another: Liquefy the things. Therefore, Arras saith: Unless ye pound the thing diligently in the fire, Ethelia does not ascend. The Master hath put forth a view which I shall now explain to the reasoners. Know ye that a very great wind of the south, when it is stirred up, sublimates clouds and elevates the vapours of the sea.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Thou hast dealt obscurely.</p>\n<p>And he:- I will explain the testa, and the vessel wherein is incombustible sulphur.

Therefore, place these in a glass vessel over the fire, and cook until the whole becomes Cambar. Then God will accomplish the arcanum ye seek. But I direct you to cook continuously, and not to grow tired of repeating the process. And know ye that the perfection of this work is the confection of water of sulphur with tabula; finally, it is cooked until it becomes Rubigo, for all the Philosophers have said: He who is able to turn Rubigo into golden venom has already achieved the desired work, but otherwise his labour is vain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fifty-fifth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Fifty-Fifth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fifty-fifth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Zenon saith:- Pythagoras hath treated concerning the water, which the envious have called by all names.

But the vulgar putrefy with the humid. Thus the humid is merely coagulated with the dry. But out of both is the beginning of the work.

Ye have then those four elements without which nothing is ever generated, nor is anything absolved in the Art. Mix, therefore, the dry with the humid, which are earth and water, and cook in the fire and in the air, whence the spirit and the soul are dessicated. And know ye that the tenuous tingeing agent takes its power out of the tenuous part of the earth, out of the tenuous part of the fire and of the air, while out of the tenuous part of the water, a tenuous spirit has been dessicated. This, therefore, is the process of our work, namely, that everything may be turned into earth when the tenuous parts of these things are extracted, because a body is then composed which is a kind of atmospheric thing, and thereafter tinges the imposed body of coins. Beware, however, O all ye investigators of this art, lest ye multiply things, for the envious have multiplied and destroyed for you! They have also described various regimens that they might deceive; they have further called it (or have likened it to) the humid with all the humid, and the dry with all the dry, by the name of every stone and metal, gall of animals of the sea, the winged things of heaven and reptiles of the earth. But do ye who would tinge observe that bodies are tinged with bodies. For I say to you what the Philosopher said briefly and truly at the beginning of his book. In the art of gold is the quicksilver from Cambar, and in coins is the quicksilver from the Male. In nothing, however, look beyond this, since the two quicksilvers are also one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fifty-seventh-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Fifty-Seventh Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fifty-seventh-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Acratus saith:- I signify to posterity that I make philosophy near to the Sun and Moon.

Cooking must proceed for seven days, when the copper, already pounded with the coins, is found turned into water. Let both be again slowly cooked, and fear nothing. Then let the vessel be opened, and a blackness will appear above. Repeat the process, cook continually until the blackness of Kuhul, which is from the blackness of coins, be consumed. For when that is consumed a precious whiteness will appear on them; finally, being returned to their place, they are cooked until the whole is dried and is turned into stone. Also repeatedly and continuously cook that stone born of copper and coins with a fire sharper than the former, until the stone is destroyed, broken up, and turned into cinder, which is a precious cinder. Alas, O ye sons of the Doctrine, how precious is that which is produced from it! Mixing, therefore, the cinder with water, cook again, until that cinder liquefy therewith, and then cook and imbue with permanent water, until the composition becomes sweet and mild and red. Imbue until it becomes humid. Cook in a still hotter fire, and carefully close the mouth of the vessel, for by this regimen fugitive bodies become not-fugitive, spirits are turned into bodies, bodies into spirits, and both are connected together. Then are spirits made bodies having a tingeing and germinating soul.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- Now hast thou notified to posterity that Rubigo attaches itself to copper after the blackness is washed off with permanent water. Then it is congealed and becomes a body of Magnesia. Finally, it is cooked until the whole body is broken up. Afterwards the volatile is turned into a cinder and becomes copper without its shadow. Attrition also truly takes place. Concerning, therefore, the work of the Philosophers, what hast thou delivered to posterity, seeing that thou hast by no means called things by their proper names!</p>\n<p>And he:- Following your own footsteps, I have discoursed even as have you.</p>\n<p>Bonellus answereth:- You speak truly, for if you did otherwise we should not order your sayings to be written in our books.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-fifty-eighth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Fifty-Eighth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fifty-eighth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Balgus saith:- The whole Turba, O Acratus, has already spoken, as you have seen, but a benefactor sometimes deceives, though his intention is to do good.</p>\n<p>And they:- Thou speakest truly. Proceed, therefore, according to thy opinion, and beware of envy!</p>\n<p>Then he:- You must know that the envious have described this arcanum in the shade; in physical reasoning and astronomy, and the art of images; they have also likened it to trees; they have ambiguously concealed it by the names of metals, vapours, and reptiles; as is generally perceived in all their work. I, nevertheless, direct you, investigators of this science, to take iron and draw it into plates; finally, mix (or sprinkle) it with venom, and place it in its vessel, the mouth of which must be closed most carefully, and beware lest ye too much increase the humour, or, on the other hand, lest it be too dry, but stir it vigorously as a mass, because, if the water be in excess, it will not be contained in the chimney, while, if it be too dry, it will neither be conjoined nor cooked in the chimney; hence I direct you to confect it diligently; finally, place it in its vessel, the mouth of which must be closed internally and externally with clay, and, having kindled coals above it, after some days ye shall open it, and there shall ye find the iron plates already liquefied; while on the lid of the vessel ye shall find globules. For when the fire is kindled the vinegar ascends, because its spiritual nature passes into the air, wherefore, I direct you to keep that part separately. Ye must also know that by multiplied decoctions and attritions it is congealed and coloured by the fire, and its nature is changed. By a similar decoction and liquefaction Cambar is not disjoined. I notify to you that by the said frequent decoction the weight of a third part of the water is consumed, but the residue becomes a wind in the Cambar of the second spirit. And know ye that nothing is more precious or more excellent than the red sand of the sea, for the Sputum of Luna is united with the light of the Sun's rays. Luna is perfected by the coming on of night, and by the heat of the Sun the dew is congealed. Then, that being wounded, the dew of the death dealer is joined, and the more the days pass on the more intensely is it congealed, and is not burned. For he who cooks with the Sun is himself congealed, and that signal whiteness causes it to overcome the terrene fire.</p>\n<p>Then saith Bonites:- Do you not know, O Balgus, that the Spume of Luna tinges nothing except our copper?</p>\n<p>And Balgus:- Thou speakest truly.</p>\n<p>And he:- Why, therefore, hast thou omitted to describe that tree, of the fruit whereof whosoever eateth shall hunger nevermore?</p>\n<p>And Balgus:- A certain person, who has followed science, has notified to me after what manner he discovered this same tree, and appropriately operating, did extract the fruit and eat of it. But when I inquired of him concerning the growth and the increment, he described that pure whiteness, thinking that the same is found without any laborious disposition. Then its Perfection is the fruit thereof. But when I further asked how it is nourished with food until it fructifies, he said: Take that tree, and build a house about it, which shall wholly surround the same, which shall also be circular, dark, encircled by dew, and shall have placed on it a man of a hundred years; shut and secure the door lest dust or wind should reach them. Then in the time of 180 days send them away to their homes. I say that man shall not cease to eat of the fruit of that tree to the perfection of the number [of the days] until the old man shall become young. O what marvellous natures, which have transformed the soul of that old man into a juvenile body, and the father is made into the son!

It should be known that all the Philosophers, while they have concealed this disposition, yet spoke the truth in their treatises when they named water of life, for this reason, that whatsoever is mixed with the said water first dies, then lives and becomes young. And know, all ye disciples, that iron does not become rusty except by reason of this water, because it tinges the plates; it is then placed in the sun till it liquefies and is imbued, after which it is congealed. In these days it becomes rusty, but silence is better than this illumination.</p>\n<p>The Turba answereth:- O Theophilus, beware of becoming envious, and complete thy speech!</p>\n<p>And he:- Would that I might repeat the like thing!</p>\n<p>And they:- What is thy will?</p>\n<p>Then he:- Certain fruits, which proceed first from that perfect tree, do flourish in the beginning of the summer, and the more they are multiplied the more are they adorned, until they are perfected, and being mature become sweet. In the same way that woman, fleeing from her own children, with whom she lives, although partly angry, yet does not brook being overcome, nor that her husband should possess her beauty, who furiously loves her, and keeps awake contending with her, till he shall have carnal intercourse with her, and God make perfect the foetus, when he multiplies children to himself according to his pleasure. His beauty, therefore, is consumed by fire who does not approach his wife except by reason of lust. For when the term is finished he turns to her. I also make known to you that the dragon never dies, but the Philosophers have put to death the woman who slays her spouses. For the belly of that woman is full of weapons and venom. Let, therefore, a sepulchre be dug for the dragon, and let that woman be buried with him, who being strongly joined with that woman, the more he clasps her and is entwined with her, the more his body, by the creation of female weapons in the body of the woman, is cut up into parts. For perceiving him mixed with the limbs of a woman he becomes secure from death, and the whole is turned into blood. But the Philosophers, beholding him turned into blood, leave him in the sun for certain days, until the lenitude is consumed, the blood dries up, and they find that venom which now is manifest. Then the wind is hidden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-sixtieth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Sixtieth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-sixtieth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Bonellus saith:- Know, all ye disciples, that out of the elect things nothing becomes useful without conjunction and regimen, because sperma is generated out of blood and desire. For the man mingling with the woman, the sperm is nourished by the humour of the womb, and by the moistening blood, and by heat, and when forty nights have elapsed the sperm is formed. But if the humidity of the blood and of the womb were not heat, the sperm would not be dissolved, nor the foetus be procreated. But God has constituted that heat and blood for the nourishment of the sperm until the foetus is brought forth, after which it is not nourished, save by milk and fire, sparingly and gradually, while it is dust, and the more it burns the more, the bones being strengthened, it is led towards youth, arriving at which it is independent. Thus it behoves you also to act in this Art. Know ye that without heat nothing is ever generated, and that the bath causes the matter to perish by means of intense heat. If, indeed, it be frigid, it puts to flight and disperses, but if it have been tempered, it is convenient and sweet to the body, wherefore the veins become smooth and the flesh is augmented.

Further, the Philosophers have already said: Take instruments out of the egg. Yet they have not said what the egg is, nor of what bird. And know ye that the regimen of these things is more difficult than the entire work, because, if the composition be ruled more than it should be, its light is taken and extinguished by the sea. Wherefore the Philosophers have ordered that it should be ruled with profound judgment. The moon, therefore, being at the full, take this and place in sand till it be dissolved. And know ye that while ye are placing the same in sand and repeating the process, unless ye have patience, ye err in ruling, and corrupt the work. Cook, therefore, the same in a gentle fire until ye see that it is dissolved. Then extinguish with vinegar, and ye shall find one thing separated from three companions.

And know that the ancient priests did not condescend to wear artificial garments, whence, for purifying altars, and lest they should introduce into them anything sordid or impure, they tinged Kenckel with a Tyrian colour; but our Tyrian colour, which they placed in their altars and treasuries, was more clean and fragrant than can be described by me, which also has been extracted from our red and most pure sea, which is sweet and of a pleasant odour, and is neither sordid nor impure in putrefaction. And know ye that we have given many names to it. which are all true - an example of which, for those that possess understanding, is to be traced in corn that is being ground.

But I will explain the regimen of this small thing, in order that any one, being introduced into this Art, may become bolder, may, more assuredly consider it, and although it be small, may compose the common with that which is dear, and the dear with that which is common. Know ye that in the beginning of the mixing, it behoves you to commingle elements which are crude, gentle, sincere, and not cooked or governed, over a gentle fire. Beware of intensifying the fire until the elements are conjoined, for these should follow one another, and be embraced in a complexion, whereby they are gradually burnt, until they be dessicated in the said gentle fire. And know that one spirit burns one thing and destroys one thing, and one body strengthens one spirit, and teaches the same to contend with the fire. But, after the first combustion, it is necessary that it should be washed, cleansed, and dealbated on the fire until all things become one colour; with which, afterwards, it behoves you to mix the residuum of the whole humour, and then its colour will be exalted. For the elements, being diligently cooked in the fire, rejoice, and are changed into different natures, because the liquefied, which is the lead, becomes not-liquefied, the humid becomes dry, the thick body becomes a spirit, and the fleeing spirit becomes strong and fit to do battle against the fire. Whence the Philosopher saith: Convert the elements and thou shalt find what thou seekest. But to convert the elements is to make the moist dry and the fugitive fixed. These things being accomplished by the disposition, let the operator leave it in the fire until the gross be made subtle, and the subtle remain as a tingeing spirit. Know ye, also, that the death and life of the elements proceed from fire, and that the composite germinates itself, and produces that which ye desire, God favouring.

But when, O all ye seekers after this Art, ye shall perceive that whiteness appear and flowing over all, be certain that redness is hid in that whiteness! However, it does not behove you to extract it, but rather to cook it until the whole become a most deep red, with which nothing can compare.

And the sulphur which blackens is that which does not open the door to the fugitive and turns into the fugitive with the fugitive. Do you not see that the cruciating does not cruciate with harm or corruption, but by co-adunation and utility of things? For if its victim were noxious and inconvenient, it would not be embraced thereby until its colours were extracted from it unalterable and indelible. This we have called water of sulphur, which water we have prepared for the red tinctures; for the rest it does not blacken; but that which does blacken, and this does not come to pass without blackness, I have testified to be the key of the work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-seventieth-dictum.\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Seventieth Dictum. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-seventieth-dictum.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Mundus saith:- Know, all ye investigators of this Art, that the head is all things, which if it hath not, all that it imposes profits nothing.

But when it is ruled it is called by ten names, taken from the colours which appear in the regimen of the body of this Magnesia. It is necessary, therefore, that the lead be turned into blackness; then the ten aforesaid shall appear in the ferment of gold, with sericon, which is a composition called by ten names. When all these things have been said, we mean nothing more by these names than Albar of copper, because it tinges every body which has entered into the composition. But composition is twofold - one is humid, the other is dry. When they are cooked prudently they become one, and are called the good thing of several names. But when it becomes red it is called Flower of Gold, Ferment of Gold, Gold of Coral, Gold of the Beak. It is also called redundant red sulphur and red orpiment. But while it remains crude lead of copper, it is called bars and plates of metal. Behold I have revealed its names when it is raw, which also we should distinguish from the names when it has been cooked. Let it therefore be pondered over. It behoves me now to exhibit to you the quantity of the fire, and the numbers of its days, and the diversity of intensity thereof in every grade, so that he who shall possess this book may belong unto himself, and be freed from poverty, so that he shall remain secure in that middle way which is closed to those who are deficient in this most precious art. I have seen, therefore, many kinds of fire. One is made out of straw and cinder, coals and flame, but one without flame. Experiment shows that there are intermediate grades between these kinds. But lead is lead of copper, in which is the whole arcanum. Now, concerning the days of the night in which will be the perfection of the most great arcanum, I will treat in its Proper place in what follows. And know most assuredly that if a little gold be placed in the composition, there will result a patent and white tincture. Wherefore also a sublime gold and a patent gold is found in the treasuries of the former philosophers. Wherefore those things are unequal which they introduce into their composition. Inasmuch as the elements are commingled and are turned into lead of copper, coming out of their own former natures, they are turned into a new nature. Then they are called one nature and one genus. These things being accomplished, it is placed in a glass vessel, unless in a certain way the composition drinks the water and is altered in its colours. In every grade it is beheld, when it is coloured by a venerable redness. Although concerning this elixir we read in the sayings of the philosophers: Take gold, occurring frequently, it is only needful to do so once. Wishing, therefore, to know the certitude of the adversary, consider what Democritus saith, how he begins speaking from bottom to top, then reversing matters he proceeds from top to bottom. For, he said: Take iron, lead, and albar for copper, which reversing, he again says: And our copper for coins, lead for gold, gold for gold of coral, and gold of coral for gold of crocus. Again, in the second place, when he begins from the top to the bottom, he saith: Take gold, coin, copper, lead, and iron; he shews, therefore, by his sayings that only semi-gold is taken. And without doubt gold is not changed into rust without lead and copper, and unless it be imbued with vinegar known by the wise, until, being cooked, it is turned into redness. This, therefore, is the redness which all the Philosophers signified, because, how ever they said: Take gold and it becomes gold of coral; Take gold of coral and it becomes purple gold - all these things are only names of those colours, for it behoves them that vinegar be placed in it, because these colours come from it. But by these things which the Philosophers have mentioned under various names, they have signified stronger bodies and forces. It is taken, therefore, once, that it may become rubigo and then vinegar is imposed on it. For when the said colours appear, it is necessary that each be decocted in forty days, so that it may be desiccated, the water being consumed; finally being imbued and placed in the vessel, it is cooked until its utility appear. Its first grade becomes as a citrine mucra, the second as red, the third as the dry pounded crocus of the vulgar. So is it imposed upon coin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#conclusion.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Agmon saith:- I will add the following by way of a corollary. Whosoever does not liquefy and coagulate errs greatly. Therefore, make the earth black; separate the soul and the water thereof, afterwards whiten; so shall ye find what ye seek. I say unto you that whoso makes earth black and then dissolves with fire, till it becomes even like unto a naked sword, who also fixes the whole with consuming fire, deserves to be called happy, and shall be exalted above the circle of the world. This much concerning the revelation of our stone, is, we doubt not, enough for the Sons of the Doctrine. The strength thereof, shall never become corrupted, but the same, when it is placed in the fire, shall be increased. If you seek to dissolve, it shall be dissolved; but if you would coagulate, it shall be coagulated. Behold, no one is without it, and yet all do need it! There are many names given to it, and yet it is called by one only, while, if need be, it is concealed. It is also a stone and not a stone, spirit, soul, and body; it is white, volatile, concave, hairless, cold, and yet no one can apply the tongue with impunity to its surface. If you wish that it should fly, it flies; if you say that it is water, you Speak the truth; if you say that it is not water, you speak falsely. Do not then be deceived by the multiplicity of names, but rest assured that it is one thing, unto which nothing alien is added. Investigate the place thereof, and add nothing that is foreign. Unless the names were multiplied, so that the vulgar might be deceived, many would deride our wisdom.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"the-coelum-philosophorum-or-book-of-vexations\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE COELUM PHILOSOPHORUM, OR BOOK OF VEXATIONS <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-coelum-philosophorum-or-book-of-vexations\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<pre><code>By PHILIPPUS THEOPHRASTUS PARACELSUS.\nTHE SCIENCE AND NATURE OF ALCHEMY, AND WHAT OPINION SHOULD BE FORMED THEREOF.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Regulated by the Seven Rules or Fundamental Canons according to the seven commonly known Metals; and containing a<br />\nPreface with certain Treatises and Appendices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-preface-of-theophrastus-paracelsus-to-all-alchemists-and-readers-of-this-book.\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE PREFACE OF THEOPHRASTUS PARACELSUS TO ALL ALCHEMISTS AND READERS OF THIS BOOK. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-preface-of-theophrastus-paracelsus-to-all-alchemists-and-readers-of-this-book.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>YOU who are skilled in Alchemy, and as many others as promise yourselves great riches or chiefly desire to make gold and silver, which Alchemy in different ways promises and teaches; equally, too, you who willingly undergo toil and vexations, and wish not to be freed from them, until you have attained your rewards, and the fulfilment of the promises made to you; experience teaches this every day, that out of thousands of you not even one accomplishes his desire. Is this a failure of Nature or of Art? I say, no; but it is rather the fault of fate, or of the unskilfulness of the operator.</p>\n<p>Since, therefore, the characters of the sign of the stars and planets of heaven, together with the other names, inverted words, receipts, materials, and instruments are thoroughly well known to such as are acquainted with this art, it would be altogether superfluous to recur to these same subjects in the present book, although the use of such signs, names, and characters at the proper time is by no means without advantage.</p>\n<p>But herein will be noticed another way of treating Alchemy different from the previous method, and deduced by Seven Canons from the sevenfold series of the metals. This, indeed, will not give scope for a pompous parade of words, but, nevertheless, in the consideration of those Canons everything which should be separated from Alchemy will be treated at sufficient length, and, moreover, many secrets of other things are herein contained. Hence, too, result certain marvellous speculations and new operations which frequently differ from the writings and opinions of ancient operators and natural philosophers, but have been discovered and confirmed by full proof and experimentation.<br />\nMoreover, in this Art nothing is more true than this, though it be little known and gains small confidence. All the fault and cause of difficulty in Alchemy, whereby very many persons are reduced to poverty, and others labour in vain, is wholly and solely lack of skill in the operator, and the defect or excess of materials, whether in quantity or quality, whence it ensues that, in the course of operation, things are wasted or reduced to nothing. If the true process shall have been found, the substance itself while transmuting approaches daily more and more towards perfection. The straight road is easy, but it is found by very few.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it may happen that a speculative artist may, by his own eccentricity, think out for himself some new method in Alchemy, be the consequence anything or nothing. He need do nought in order to reduce something into nothing, and again bring back something out of nothing. Yet this proverb of the incredulous is not wholly false. Destruction perfects that which is good; for the good cannot appear on account of that which conceals it. The good is least good whilst it is thus concealed. The concealment must be removed that so the good may be able freely to appear in its own brightness. For example, the mountain, the sand, the earth, or the stone in which a metal has grown is such a concealment. Each one of the visible metals is a concealment of the other six metals.</p>\n<p>By the element of fire all that is imperfect is destroyed and taken away, as, for instance, the five metals, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Saturn.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup>. On the other hand, the perfect metals, Sol and Luna, are not consumed in that same fire. They remain in the fire: and at the same time, out of the other imperfect ones which are destroyed, they assume their own body and become visible to the eyes. How, and by what method, this comes about can be gathered from the Seven Canons. Hence it may be learnt what are the nature and property of each metal, what it effects with the other metals, and what are its powers in commixture with them.</p>\n<p>But this should be noted in the very first place: that these Seven Canons cannot be perfectly understood by every cursory reader at a first glance or a single reading. An inferior intelligence does not easily perceive occult and abstruse subjects. Each one of these Canons demands no slight discussion. Many persons, puffed up with pride, fancy they can easily comprehend all which this book comprises. Thus they set down its contents as useless and futile, thinking they have something far better of their own, and that therefore they can afford to despise what is here contained.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-i:-the-seven-canons-of-the-metals.\" tabindex=\"-1\">PART I: THE SEVEN CANONS OF THE METALS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#part-i:-the-seven-canons-of-the-metals.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"the-first-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-of-mercury.\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE FIRST CANON: CONCERNING THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF MERCURY.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn1\" id=\"fnref1:1\">[1:1]</a></sup> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-first-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-of-mercury.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>All things are concealed in all. One of them all is the concealer of the rest – their corporeal vessel, external, visible, and movable. All liquefactions are manifested in that vessel. For the vessel is a living and corporeal spirit, and so all coagulations or congelations enclosed in it, when prevented from flowing and surrounded, are not therewith content. No name can be found for this liquefaction, by which it may be designated; still less can it be found for its origin. And since no heat is so strong as to be equalised therewith, it should be compared to the fire of Gehenna. A liquefaction of this kind has no sort of connection with others made by the heat of natural fire, or congelated or coagulated by natural cold. These congelations, through their weakness, are unable to obtain in Mercury, and therefore, on that account, he altogether contemns them. Hence one may gather that elementary powers, in their process of destruction, can add nothing to, nor take away anything from, celestial powers (which are called Quintessence or its elements), nor have they any capacity for operating. Celestial and infernal powers do not obey the four elements, whether they be dry, moist, hot, or cold. No one of them has the faculty of acting against a Quintessence; but each one contains within itself its own powers and means of action.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-second-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-of-jupiter.\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE SECOND CANON: CONCERNING THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF JUPITER. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-second-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-of-jupiter.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In that which is manifest (that is to say, the body of Jupiter) the other six corporeal metals are spiritually concealed, but one more deeply and more tenaciously than another. Jupiter has nothing of a Quintessence in his composition, but is of the nature of the four elementaries. On this account this liquefaction is brought about by the application of a moderate fire, and, in like manner, he is coagulated by moderate cold. He has affinity with the liquefactions of all the other metals. For the more like he is to some other nature, the more easily he is united thereto by conjunction. For the operation of those nearly allied is easier and more natural than of those which are remote. The remote body does not press upon the other. At the same time, it is not feared, though it may be very powerful. Hence it happens that men do not aspire to the superior orders of creation, because they are far distant from them, and do not see their glory. In like manner, they do not much fear those of an inferior order, because they are remote, and none of the living knows their condition or has experienced the misery of their punishment. For this cause an infernal spirit is accounted as nothing. For more remote objects are on that account held more cheaply and occupy a lower place, since according to the propriety of its position each object turns out better, or is transmuted. This can be proved by various examples.</p>\n<p>The more remote, therefore, Jupiter is found to be from Mars and Venus, and the nearer Sol and Luna, the more &quot;goldness&quot; or &quot;silveriness&quot;, if I may so say, it contains in its body, and the greater, stronger, more visible, more tangible, more amiable, more acceptable, more distinguished, and more true it is found than in some remote body. Again, the more remote a thing is, of the less account is it esteemed in all the respects aforesaid, since what is present is always preferred before what is absent. In proportion as the nearer is clear the more remote is occult. This, therefore, is a point which you, as an Alchemist, must seriou(S)ly debate with yourself, how you can relegate Jupiter to a remote and abstruse place, which Sol and Luna occupy, and how, in turn, you can summon Sol and Luna from remote positions to a near place, where Jupiter is corporeally posited; so that, in the same way, Sol and Luna also may really be present there corporeally before your eyes. For the transmutation of metals from imperfection to perfection there are several practical receipts. Mix the one with the other. Then again separate the one pure from the other. This is nothing else but the process of permutation, set in order by perfect alchemical labour. Note that Jupiter has much gold and not a little silver. Let Saturn and Luna be imposed on him, and of the rest Luna will be augmented.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-third-canon:-concerning-mars-and-his-properties.\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE THIRD CANON: CONCERNING MARS AND HIS PROPERTIES. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-third-canon:-concerning-mars-and-his-properties.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The six occult metals have expelled the seventh from them, and have made it corporeal, leaving it little efficacy, and imposing on it great hardness and weight. This being the case, they have shaken off all their own strength of coagulation and hardness, which they manifest in this other body. On the contrary, they have retained in themselves their colour and liquefaction, together with their nobility. It is very difficult and laborious for a prince or a king to be produced out of an unfit and common man. But Mars acquires dominion. with strong and pugnacious hand, and seizes on the position of king. He should, however, be on his guard against snares; that he be not led captive suddenly and unexpectedly. It must also be considered by what method Mars may be able to take the place of king, and Sol and Luna, with Saturn, hold the place of Mars.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\">[5]</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-fourth-canon:-concerning-venus-and-its-properties.\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE FOURTH CANON: CONCERNING VENUS AND ITS PROPERTIES. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fourth-canon:-concerning-venus-and-its-properties.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The other six metals have rendered Venus an extrinsical body by means of all their colour and method of liquefaction. It may be necessary, in order to understand this, that we should show, by some examples, how a manifest thing may be rendered occult, and an occult thing rendered materially manifest by means of fire. Whatever is combustible can be naturally transmuted by fire from one form into another, namely, into lime, soot, ashes, glass, colours, stones, and earth. This last can again be reduced to many new metallic bodies. If a metal, too, be burnt, or rendered fragile by old rust, it can again acquire malleability by applications of fire.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-fifth-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-op-saturn.\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE FIFTH CANON: CONCERNING THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OP SATURN. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fifth-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-op-saturn.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Of his own nature Saturn speaks thus: The other six have cast me out as their examiner. They have thrust me forth from them and from a spiritual place. They have also added a corruptible body as a place of abode, so that I may be what they neither are nor desire to become. My six brothers are spiritual, and thence it ensues that so often as I am put in the fire they penetrate my body and, together with me, perish in the fire, Sol and Luna excepted. These are purified and ennobled in my water. My spirit is a water softening the rigid and congelated bodies of my brothers. Yet my body is inclined to the earth. Whatever is received into me becomes conformed thereto, and by means of us is converted into one body. It would be of little use to the world if it should learn, or at least believe, what lies hid in me, and what I am able to effect. It would be more profitable it should ascertain what I am able to do with myself. Deserting all the methods of the Alchemists, it would then use only that which is in me and can be done by me.

It is not useful to transmute what is perfect into what is imperfect, but the latter into the former. Nevertheless, it is well to know what is the material of Luna, or whence it proceeds. Whoever is not able to consider or find this out will neither be able to make Luna. It will be asked, What is Luna? It is among the seven metals which are spiritually concealed, itself the seventh, external, corporeal, and material. For this seventh always contains the six metals spiritually hidden in itself. And the six spiritual metals do not exist without one external and material metal. So also no corporeal metal can have place or essence without those six spiritual ones. The seven corporeal metals mix easily by means of liquefaction, but this mixture is not useful for making Sol or Luna. For in that mixture each metal remains in its own nature, or fixed in the fire, or flies from it. For example, mix, in any way you can, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, Sol, and Luna. It will not thence result that Sol and Luna will so change the other five that, by the agency of Sol and Luna, these will become Sol and Luna. For though all be liquefied into a single mass, nevertheless each remains in its nature whatever it is. This is the judgment which must be passed on corporeal mixture. But concerning spiritual mixture and communion of the metals, it should be known that no separation or mortification is spiritual, because such spirits can never exist without bodies. Though the body should be taken away from them and mortified a hundred times in one hour, nevertheless, they would always acquire another much more noble than the former. And this is the transposition of the metals from one death to another, that is to say, from a lesser degree into one greater and higher, namely, into Luna; and from a better into the best and most most perfect, that is, into Sol, the brilliant and altogether royal metal. It is most true, then, as frequently said above, that the six metals always generate a seventh, or produce it from themselves clear in its esse.</p>\n<p>A question may arise: If it be true that Luna and every metal derives its origin and is generated from the other six, what is then its property and its nature? To this we reply: From Saturn, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Sol, nothing and no other metal than Luna could be made. The cause is that each metal has two good virtues of the other six, of which altogether there are twelve. These are the spirit of Luna, which thus in a few words may be made known. Luna is composed of the six spiritual metals and their virtues, whereof each possesses two. Altogether, therefore, twelve are thus posited in one corporeal metal, which are compared to the seven planets and the twelve celestial signs. Luna has from the planet Mercury, and from Aquarius and Pisces, its liquidity and bright white colour. So Luna has from Jupiter, with Sagittarius and Taurus, its white colour and its great firmness in fire. Luna has from Mars, with Cancer and Aries, its hardness and its clear sound. Luna has from Venus, with Gemini and Libra, its measure of coagulation and its From Saturn, with Virgo and Scorpio, its homogeneous body, with gravity. From Sol, with Leo and Virgo, its spotless purity and great constancy against the power of fire. Such is the knowledge of the natural exaltation and of the course of the spirit and body of Luna, with its composite nature and wisdom briefly summarised.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it should be pointed out what kind of a body such metallic spirits acquire in their primitive generation by means of celestial influx. For the metal-digger, when he has crushed the stone, contemptible as it is in appearance, liquefies it, corrupts it, and altogether mortifies it with fire. Then this metallic spirit, in such a process of mortification, receives a better and more noble body, not friable but malleable. Then comes the Alchemist, who again corrupts, mortifies, and artificially prepares such a metallic body. Thus once more that spirit of the metal assumes a more noble and more perfect body, putting itself forward clearly into the light, except it be Sol or Luna. Then at last the metallic spirit and body are perfectly united, are safe from the corruption of elementary fire, and also incorruptible.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-seventh-canon:-concerning-the-nature-of-sol-and-its-properties.\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE SEVENTH CANON: CONCERNING THE NATURE OF SOL AND ITS PROPERTIES. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-seventh-canon:-concerning-the-nature-of-sol-and-its-properties.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The seventh after the six spiritual metals is corporeally Sol, which in itself is nothing but pure fire. What in outward appearance is more beautiful, more brilliant, more clear and perceptible, a heavier, colder, or more homogeneous body to see? And it is easy to perceive the cause of this, namely, that it contains in itself the congelations of the other six metals, out of which it is made externally into one most compact body. Its liquefaction proceeds from elementary fire, or is caused by the liquations of Mercury, with Pisces and Aquarius, concealed spiritually within it. The most manifest proof of this is that Mercury is easily mingled corporeally with the Sun as in an embrace. But for Sol, when the heat is withdrawn and the cold supervenes after liquefaction, to coagulate and to become hard and solid, there is need of the other five metals, whose nature it embraces in itself – Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, Luna. In these five metals the cold abodes with their regimens are especially found. Hence it happens that Sol can with difficulty be liquefied without the heat of fire, on account of the cold whereof mention has been made. For Mercury cannot assist with his natural heat or liquefaction, or defend himself against the cold of the five metals, because the heat of Mercury is not sufficient to retain Sol in a state of liquefaction. Wherefore Sol has to obey the five metals rather than Mercury alone. Mercury itself has no office of itself save always to flow. Hence it happens that in coagulations of the other metals it can effect nothing, since its nature is not to make anything hard or solid, but liquid. To render fluid is the nature of heat and life, but cold has the nature of hardness, consolidation, and immobility, which is compared to death. For example, the six cold metals, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Mars, Venus, Luna, if they are to be liquefied must be brought to that condition by the heat of fire. Snow or ice, which are cold, will not produce this effect, but rather will harden. As soon as ever the metal liquefied by fire is removed therefrom, the cold, seizing upon it, renders it hard, congelated, and immovable of itself. But in order that Mercury may remain fluid and alive continually, say, I pray you, whether this will be affected with heat on cold? Whoever answers that this is brought about by a cold and damp nature, and that it has its life from cold – the promulgator of this opinion, having no knowledge of Nature, is led away by the vulgar. For the vulgar man judges only falsely, and always holds firmly on to his error. So then let him who loves truth withdraw therefrom. Mercury, in fact, lives not at all from cold but from a warm and fiery nature. Whatever lives is fire, because heat is life, but cold the occasion of death. The fire of Sol is of itself pure, not indeed alive, but hard, and so far shews the colour of sulphur in that yellow and red are mixed therein in due proportion. The five cold metals are Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, and Luna, which assign to Sol their virtues; according to cold, the body itself; according to fire, colour; according to dryness, solidity; according to humidity, weight; and out of brightness, sound. But that gold is not burned in the element of terrestrial fire, nor is even corrupted, is effected by the firmness of Sol. For one fire cannot burn another, or even consume it; but rather if fire be added to fire it is increased, and becomes more powerful in its operations. The celestial fire which flows to us on the earth from the Sun is not such a fire as there is in heaven, neither is it like that which exists upon the earth, but that celestial fire with us is cold and congealed, and it is the body of the Sun. Wherefore the Sun can in no way be overcome by our fire. This only happens, that it is liquefied, like snow or ice, by that same celestial Sun. Fire, therefore, has not the power of burning fire, because the Sun is fire, which, dissolved in heaven, is coagulated with us.</p>\n<pre><code>   Gold is in its              1  Celestial           Dissolved\n   Essence three-            { 2  Elementary}   and   Fluid\n   fold                        3  Metallic      is    Corporeal.\n</code></pre>\n<p>THE END OF THE SEVEN CANONS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-ii:-certain-treatises-and-appendices-arising-out-of-the-seven-canons.\" tabindex=\"-1\">PART II: CERTAIN TREATISES AND APPENDICES ARISING OUT OF THE SEVEN CANONS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#part-ii:-certain-treatises-and-appendices-arising-out-of-the-seven-canons.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"god-and-nature-do-nothing-in-vain.\" tabindex=\"-1\">GOD AND NATURE DO NOTHING IN VAIN. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#god-and-nature-do-nothing-in-vain.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>THE eternal position of all things, independent of time, without beginning or end, operates everywhere.

There is another method, far different and much more concise, whereby, with little waste of Mercury and less expenditure of toil, it is transmuted into Luna without congelation. Any one can at pleasure learn this Art in Alchemy, since it is so simple and easy; and by it, in a short time, he could make any quantity of silver and gold. It is tedious to read long descriptions, and everybody wishes to be advised in straightforward words. Do this, then; proceed as follows, and you will have Sol and Luna, by help whereof you will turn out a very rich man. Wait awhile, I beg, while this process is described to you in few words, and keep these words well digested, so that out of Saturn, Mercury, and Jupiter you may make Sol and Luna. There is not, nor ever will be, any art so easy to find out and practise, and so effective in itself. The method of making Sol and Luna by Alchemy is so prompt that there is no more need of books, or of elaborate instruction, than there would be if one wished to write about last year's snow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"concerning-the-receipts-of-alchemy.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CONCERNING THE RECEIPTS OF ALCHEMY. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#concerning-the-receipts-of-alchemy.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>What, then, shall we say about the receipts of Alchemy, and about the diversity of its vessels and instruments? These are furnaces, glasses, jars, waters, oils, limes, sulphurs, salts, saltpetres, alums, vitriols, chrysocollae, copper-greens, atraments, auri-pigments, fel vitri, ceruse, red earth, thucia, wax, lutum sapientiae, pounded glass, verdigris, soot, testae ovorum, crocus of Mars, soap, crystal, chalk, arsenic, antimony, minium, elixir, lazurium, gold-leaf, salt-nitre, sal ammoniac, calamine stone, magnesia, bolus armenus, and many other things. Moreover, concerning preparations, putrefactions, digestions, probations, solutions, cementings, filtrations, reverberations, calcinations, graduations, rectifications, amalgamations, purgations, etc., with these alchemical books are crammed. Then, again, concerning herbs, roots, seeds, woods, stones, animals, worms, bone dust, snail shells, other shells, and pitch. These and the like, whereof there are some very far-fetched in Alchemy, are mere incumbrances of work; since even if Sol and Luna could be made by them they rather hinder and delay than further one’s purpose. But it is not from these – to say the truth – that the Art of making Sol and Luna is to be learnt. So, then, all these things should be passed by, because they have no effect with the five metals, so far as Sol and Luna are concerned. Someone may ask, What, then, is this short and easy way, which involves no difficulty, and yet whereby Sol and Luna can be made? Our answer is, this has been fully and openly explained in the Seven Canons. It would be lost labour should one seek further to instruct one who does not understand these. It would be impossible to convince such a person that these matters could be so easily understood, but in an occult rather than in an open sense.</p>\n<p>THE ART IS THIS: After you have made heaven, or the sphere of Saturn, with its life to run over the earth, place on it all the planets, or such, one or more, as you wish, so that the portion of Luna may be the smallest. Let all run, until heaven, or Saturn, has entirely disappeared. Then all those planets will remain dead with their old corruptible bodies, having meanwhile obtained another new, perfect, and incorruptible body.<br />\nThat body is the spirit of heaven. From it these planets again receive a body and life, and live as before. Take this body from the life and the earth. Keep it. It is Sol and Luna. Here you have the Art altogether, clear and entire. If you do not yet understand it, or are not practised therein, it is well. It is better that it should be kept concealed, and not made public.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-conjure-the-crystal-so-that-all-things-may-be-seen-in-it.\" tabindex=\"-1\">HOW TO CONJURE THE CRYSTAL SO THAT ALL THINGS MAY BE SEEN IN IT. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#how-to-conjure-the-crystal-so-that-all-things-may-be-seen-in-it.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To conjure is nothing else than to observe anything rightly, to know and to understand what it is. The crystal is a figure of the air. Whatever appears in the air, movable or immovable, the same appears also in the speculum or crystal as a wave. For the air, the water, and the crystal, so far as vision is concerned, are one, like a mirror in which an inverted copy of an object is seen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"concerning-the-heat-of-mercury.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CONCERNING THE HEAT OF MERCURY. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#concerning-the-heat-of-mercury.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Those who think that Mercury is of a moist and cold nature are plainly in error, because it is by its nature in the highest degree warm and moist, which is the cause of its being in a constant state of fluidity. If it were of a moist and cold nature it would have the appearance of frozen water, and be always hard and solid, so that it would be necessary to liquefy it by the heat of fire, as in the case of the other metals. But it does not require this, since it has liquidity and flux from its own heat naturally inborn in it, which keeps it in a state of perpetual fluidity and renders it &quot;quick&quot;, so that it can neither die, nor be coagulated, nor congealed. And this is well worth noticing, that the spirits of the seven metals, or as many of them as have been commingled, as soon as they come into the fire, contend with one another, especially Mercury, so that each may put forth its powers and virtues in the endeavour to get the mastery in the way of liquefying and transmuting. One seizes on the virtue, life, and form of another, and assigns some other nature and form to this one. So then the spirits or vapours of the metals are stirred up by the heat to operate mutually one upon the other, and transmute from one virtue to another, until perfection and purity are attained.</p>\n<p>But what must be done besides to Mercury in order that its moisture and heat may be taken away, and in their place such an extreme cold introduced as to congeal, consolidate, and altogether mortify the Mercury? Do what follows in the sentence subjoined: Take pure Mercury closely shut up in a silver pixis. Fill a jar with fragments of lead, in the midst of which place the pixis. Let it melt for twenty-four hours, that is, for a natural day. This takes away from Mercury his occult heat, adds an external heat, and contributes the internal coldness of Saturn and Luna (which are both planets of a cold nature), whence and whereby the Mercury is compelled to congeal, consolidate, and harden.<br />\nNote also that the coldness (which Mercury needs in its consolidation and mortification) is not perceptible by the external sense, as the cold of snow or of ice is, but rather, externally, there is a certain amount of apparent heat. Just in the same way is it with the heat of Mercury, which is the cause of its fluidity. It is not an external heat, perceptible in the same way as one of our qualities. Nay, externally a sort of coldness is perceptible. Whence the Sophists (a race which has more talk than true wisdom) falsely assert that Mercury is cold and of a moist nature, so that they go on and advise us to congeal it by means of heat; whereas heat only renders it more fluid, as they daily find out to their own loss rather than gain.</p>\n<p>True Alchemy which alone, by its unique Art, teaches how to fabricate Sol and Luna from the five imperfect metals, allows no other receipt than this, which well and truly says: Only from metals, in metals, by metals, and with metals, are perfect metals made, for in some things is Luna and in other metals is Sol.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-materials-and-instruments-are-required-in-alchemy.\" tabindex=\"-1\">WHAT MATERIALS AND INSTRUMENTS ARE REQUIRED IN ALCHEMY. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#what-materials-and-instruments-are-required-in-alchemy.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There is need of nothing else but a foundry, bellows, tongs, hammers, cauldrons, jars, and cupels made from beechen ashes.

However, since this is the first mode of getting them, it is in no way to be despised, but greatly commended. Such a desire or appetite ought no more to be done away with than the lawful inclination of young people, and those in the prime of life, to matrimony. As the bees long for roses and other flowers for the purpose of making honey and wax, so, too, men – apart from avarice or their own aggrandisement – should seek to extract metal from the earth. He who does not seek it is not likely to find it. God dowers men not only with gold or silver, but also with poverty, squalor, and misery. He has given to some a singular knowledge of metals and minerals, whereby they have obtained an easier and shorter method of fabricating gold and silver, without digging and smelting them, than they were commonly accustomed to, by extracting them from their primitive bodies. And this is the case not only with subterranean substances, but by certain arts and knowledge they have extracted them from the five metals generally (that is to say, from metals excocted from minerals which are imperfect and called metals), viz., from Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and Venus, from all of which, and from each of them separately, Sol and Luna can be made, but from one more easily than from another. Note, that Sol and Luna can be made easily from Mercury, Saturn, and Jupiter, but from Mars and Venus with difficulty. It is possible to make them, however, but with the addition of Sol and Luna. Out of Magnesium and Saturn comes Luna, and out of Jupiter and Cinnabar pure Sol takes its rise. The skilful artist, however (how well I remember!), will be able by diligent consideration to prepare metals so that, led by a true method of reasoning, he can promote the perfection of metallic transformation more than do the courses of the twelve signs and the seven planets. In such matters it is quite superfluous to watch these courses, as also their aspects, good or bad days or hours, the prosperous or unlucky condition of this or that planet, for these matters can do no good, and much less can they do harm in the art of natural Alchemy. If otherwise, and you have a feasible process, operate when you please. If, however, there be anything wanting in you or your mode of working, or your understanding, the planets and the stars of heaven will fail you in your work.</p>\n<p>If metals remain buried long enough in the earth, not only are they consumed by rust, but by long continuance they are even transmuted into natural stones, and there are a great many of these; but this is known to few. For there is found in the earth old stone money of the heathens, printed with their different figures. These coins were originally metallic, but through the transmutation brought about by Nature, they were turned into stone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-alchemy-is.\" tabindex=\"-1\">WHAT ALCHEMY IS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#what-alchemy-is.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Alchemy is nothing else but the set purpose, intention, and subtle endeavour to transmute the kinds of the metals from one to another.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\">[10]</a></sup> According to this, each person, by his own mental grasp, can choose out for himself a better way and Art, and therein find truth, for the man who follows a thing up more intently does find the truth. It is highly necessary to have a correct estimation of stars and of stones, because the star is the informing spirit of all stones. For the Sol and Luna of all the celestial stars are nothing but one stone in itself; and the terrestrial stone has come forth from the celestial stone; through the same fire, coals, ashes, the same expulsions and repurgations as that celestial stone, it has been separated and brought, clear and pure in its brightness. The whole ball of the earth is only something thrown off, concrete, mixed, corrupted, ground, and again coagulated, and gradually liquefied into one mass, into a stony work, which has its seat and its rest in the midst of the firmamental sphere.</p>\n<p>Further it is to be remarked that those precious stones which shall forth-with be set down have the nearest place to the heavenly or sidereal ones in point of perfection, purity, beauty, brightness, virtue, power of withstanding fire, and incorruptibility, and they have been fixed with other stones in the earth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\">[11]</a></sup></p>\n<p>They have, therefore, the greatest affinity with heavenly stones and with the stars, because their natures are derived from these. They are found by men in a rude environment, and the common herd (whose property it is to take false views of things) believe that they were produced in the same place where they are found, and that they were afterwards polished, carried around, and sold, and accounted to be great riches, on account of their colours, beauty, and other virtues. A brief description of them follows:</p>\n<p><em>The Emerald</em>. This is a green transparent stone. It does good to the eyes and the memory.

The Pearl is not a stone, because it is produced in sea shells. It is of a white colour.

If anyone intelligently and reasonably takes care to exercise himself in learning about the metals, what they are, and whence they are produced: he may know that our metals are nothing else than the best part and the spirit of common stones, that is, pitch, grease, fat, oil, and stone. But this is least pure, uncontaminated, and perfect, so long as it remains hidden or mixed with the stones. It should therefore be sought and found in the stones, be recognised in them, and extracted from them, that is, forcibly drawn out and liquefied. For then it is no longer a stone, but an elaborate and perfect metal, comparable to the stars of heaven, which are themselves, as it were, stones separated from those of earth.<br />\nWhoever, therefore, studies minerals and metals must be furnished with such reason and intelligence that he shall not regard only those common and known metals which are found in the depth of the mountains alone. For there is often found at the very surface of the earth such a metal as is not met with at all, or not equally good, in the depths. And so every stone which comes to our view, be it great or small, flint or simple rock, should be carefully investigated and weighed with a true balance, according to its nature and properties. Very often a common stone, thrown away and despised, is worth more than a cow. Regard must not always be had to the place of digging from which this stone came forth; for here the influence of the sky prevails. Everywhere there is presented to us earth, or dust, or sand, which often contain much gold or silver, and this you will mark.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"the-book-concerning-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers-by-paracelsus\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Book Concerning The Tincture Of The Philosophers by Paracelsus <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-book-concerning-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers-by-paracelsus\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<pre><code>WRITTEN AGAINST THOSE SOPHISTS BORN SINCE THE DELUGE, IN THE AGE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD;\nBy PH.

Look at Hermes, Archelaus, and others in the first age: see what Spagyrists and what Philosophers then existed. By this they testify that their enemies, who are your patrons, O Sophist, at the present time are but mere empty forms and idols. Although this would not be attested by those who are falsely considered your authentic fathers and saints, yet the ancient Emerald Table shews more art and experience in Philosophy, Alchemy, Magic, and the like, than could ever be taught by you and your crowd of followers. If you do not yet understand, from the aforesaid facts, what and how great treasures these are, tell me why no prince or king was ever able to subdue the Egyptians. Then tell me why the Emperor Diocletian ordered all the Spagyric books to be burnt (so far as he could lay his hands upon them). Unless the contents of those books had been known, they would have been obliged to bear still his intolerable yoke, - a yoke, O Sophist, which shall one day be put upon the neck of yourself and your colleagues.</p>\n<p>From the middle of this age the Monarchy of all the Arts has been at length derived and conferred on me, Theophrastus Paracelsus, Prince of Philosophy and of Medicine. For this purpose I have been chosen by God to extinguish and blot out all the phantasies of elaborate and false works, of delusive and presumptuous words, be they the words of Aristotle, Galen, Avicenna, Mesva, or the dogmas of any among their followers. My theory, proceeding as it does from the light of Nature, can never, through its consistency, pass away or be changed: but in the fifty-eighth year after its millennium and a half it will then begin to flourish. The practice at the same time following upon the theory will be proved by wonderful and incredible signs, so as to be open to mechanics and common people, and they will thoroughly understand how firm and immovable is that Paracelsic Art against the triflings of the Sophists: though meanwhile that sophistical science has to have its ineptitude propped up and fortified by papal and imperial privileges. In that I am esteemed by you a mendicant and vagabond sophist, the Danube and the Rhine will answer that accusation, though I hold my tongue. Those calumnies of yours falsely devised against me have often displeased many courts and princes, many imperial cities, the knightly order, and the nobility. I have a treasure hidden in a certain city called Weinden, belonging to Forum Julii, at an inn, - a treasure which neither you, Leo of Rome, nor you, Charles the German, could purchase with all your substance. Although the signed star has been applied to the arcanum of your names, it is known to none but the sons of the divine Spagyric Art. So then, you wormy and lousy Sophist, since you deem the monarch of arcana a mere ignorant, fatuous, and prodigal quack, now, in this mid age, I determine in my present treatise to disclose the honourable course of procedure in these matters, the virtues and preparation of the celebrated Tincture of the Philosophers for the use and honour of all who love the truth, and in order that all who despise the true arts may be reduced to poverty. By this arcanum the last age shall be illuminated clearly and compensated for all its losses by the gift of grace and the reward of the spirit of truth, so that since the beginning of the world no similar germination of the intelligence and of wisdom shall ever have been heard of. In the meantime, vice will not be able to suppress the good, nor will the resources of those vicious persons, many though they be, cause any loss to the upright.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-i.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER I. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-i.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I, PHILIPPUS Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast, say that, by Divine grace, many ways have been sought to the Tincture of the Philosophers, which finally all came to the same scope and end. Hermes Trismegistus, the Egyptian, approached this task in his own method. Orus, the Greek, observed the same process. Hali, the Arabian, remained firm in his order. But Albertus Magnus, the German, followed also a lengthy process. Each one of these advanced in proportion to his own method; nevertheless, they all arrive at one and the same end, at a long life, so much desired by the philosophers, and also at an honourable sustenance and means of preserving that life in this Valley of Misery. Now at this time, I, Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast, Monarch of the Arcana, am endowed by God with special gifts for this end, that every searcher after this supreme philosophic work may be forced to imitate and to follow me, be he Italian, Pole, Gaul, German, or whatsoever or whosoever he be. Come hither after me, all you philosophers, astronomers, and spagyrists, of however lofty a name ye may be, I will show and open to you, Alchemists and Doctors, who are exalted by me with the most consummate labours, this corporeal regeneration. I will teach you the tincture, the arcanum1, the quintessence, wherein lie hid the foundations of all mysteries and of all works. For every person may and ought to believe in another only in those matters, which he has tried by fire. If any one shall have brought forward anything contrary to this method of experimentation in the Spagyric Art or in Medicine, there is no reason for your belief in him, since, experimentally, through the agency of fire, the true is separated from the false. The light of Nature indeed is created in this way, that by means thereof the proof or trial of everything may appear, but only to those who walk in this light. With this light we will teach, by the very best methods of demonstration, that all those who before me have approached this so difficult province with their own fancies and acute speculations have, to their own loss, incurred the danger of their foolishness. On which account, from my standpoint, many rustics have been ennobled; but, on the other hand, through the speculative and opinionative art of these many nobles have been changed into clowns, and since they carried golden mountains in their head before they had put their hand to the fire. First of all, then, there must be learnt - digestions, distillations, sublimations, reverberations, extractions, solutions, coagulations, fermentations, fixations, and every instrument which is requisite for this work must be mastered by experience, such as glass vessels, cucurbites, circulators, vessels of Hermes, earthen vessels, baths, blast-furnaces, reverberatories, and instruments of like kind, also marble, coals, and tongs. Thus at length you will be able to profit in Alchemy and in Medicine.</p>\n<p>But so long as, relying on fancy and opinion, you cleave to your fictitious books, you are fitted and predestinated for no one of these things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-ii:-concerning-the-definition-of-the-subject-and-matter-of-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER II: CONCERNING THE DEFINITION OF THE SUBJECT AND MATTER OF THE TINCTURE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-ii:-concerning-the-definition-of-the-subject-and-matter-of-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Before I come, then, to the process of the Tincture, it is needful that I open to you the subject thereof: for, up to the present time, this has always been kept in a specially occult way by the lovers of truth. So, then, the matter of the Tincture (when you understand me in a Spagyrical sense) is a certain thing which, by the art of Vulcan2, passes out of three essences into one essence, or it may remain. But, that I may give it its proper name, according to the use of the ancients, though it is called by many the Red Lion, still it is known by few. This, by the aid of Nature and the skill of the Artist himself, can be transmuted into a White Eagle, so that out of one two are produced; and beyond this the brightness of gold does not shine so much for the Spagyrist as do these two when kept in one. Now, if you do not understand the use of the Cabalists and the old astronomers, you are not born by God for the Spagyric art, or chosen by Nature for the work of Vulcan, or created to open your mouth concerning Alchemical Arts. The matter of the Tincture, then, is a very great pearl and a most precious treasure, and the noblest thing next to the manifestation of the Most High and the consideration of men which can exist upon earth. This is the Lili of Alchemy and of Medicine, which the philosophers have so diligently sought after, but, through the failure of entire knowledge and complete preparation, they have not progressed to the perfect end thereof. By means of their investigations and experiments, only the initial stage of the Tincture has been given to us; but the true foundation, which my colleagues must imitate, has been left for me, so that no one should mingle their shadows with our good intentions. I, by right after my long experiences, correct the Spagyrists, and separate the false or the erroneous from the true, since, by long investigations, I have found reasons why I should be able justly to blame and to change diverse things. If, indeed, I had found out experiments of the ancients better than my own, I should scarcely have taken up such great labours as, for the sake, the utility, and the advantage of all good Alchemists, I have undergone willingly. Since, then, the subject of the Tincture has been sufficiently declared, so that it scarcely could or ought to be exceeded in fidelity between two brothers, I approach its preparation, and after I have laid down the experiences of the first age, I wish to add my own inventions; to which at last the Age of Grace will by-and-by give its adhesion, whichever of the patriarchs, O Sophist, you, in the meantime, shall have made leaders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-iii:-concerning-the-process-of-the-ancients-for-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers-and-a-more-compendious-method-by-paracelsus.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER III: CONCERNING THE PROCESS OF THE ANCIENTS FOR THE TINCTURE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, AND A MORE COMPENDIOUS METHOD BY PARACELSUS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-iii:-concerning-the-process-of-the-ancients-for-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers-and-a-more-compendious-method-by-paracelsus.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The old Spagyrists putrefied Lili for a philosophical month, and afterwards distilled therefrom the moist spirits, until at length the dry spirits were elevated. They again imbued the caput mortuum with moist spirits, and drew them off from it frequently by distillation until the dry spirits were all elevated. Then afterwards they united the moisture that had been drawn off and the dry spirits by means of a pelican, three or four times, until the whole Lili remained dry at the bottom. Although early experience gave this process before fixation, none the less our ancestors often attained a perfect realisation of their wish by this method. They would, however, have had a shorter way of arriving at the treasure of the Red Lion if they had learnt the agreement of Astronomy with Alchemy, as I have demonstrated it in the Apocalypse of Hermes3. But since every day (as Christ says for the consolation of the faithful) has its own peculiar care, the labour for the Spagyrists before my times has been great and heavy; but this, by the help of the Holy Spirit flowing into us, will, in this last age, be lightened and made clear by my theory and practice, for all those who constantly persevere in their work with patience. For I have tested the properties of Nature, its essences and conditions, and I know its conjunction and resolution, which are the highest and greatest gift for a philosopher, and never understood by the sophists up to this time. When, therefore, the earliest age gave the first experience of the Tincture, the Spagyrists made two things out of one simple. But when afterwards, in the Middle Age, this invention had died out, their successors by diligent scrutiny afterwards came upon the two names of this simple, and they named it with one word, namely, Lili, as being the subject of the Tincture. At length the imitators of Nature putrefied this matter at its proper period just like the seed in the earth, since before this corruption nothing could be born from it, nor any arcanum break forth from it. Afterwards they drew off the moist spirits from the matter, until at length, by the violence of the fire, the dry were also equally sublimated, so that, in this way, just as the rustic does at the proper time of year, they might come to maturity as one after another is wont to ascend and to fall away. Lastly, as after the spring comes summer, they incorporated those fruits and dry spirits, and brought the Magistery of the Tincture to such a point that it came to the harvest, and laid itself out for ripening.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-iv:-concerning-the-process-for-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER IV: CONCERNING THE PROCESS FOR THE TINCTURE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-iv:-concerning-the-process-for-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The ancient Spagyrists would not have required such lengthened labour and such wearisome repetition if they had learnt and practised their work in my school. They would have obtained their wish just as well, with far less expense and labour. But at this time, when Theophrastus Paracelsus has arrived as the Monarch of Arcana, the opportunity is at hand for finding out those things which were occult to all Spagyrists before me. Wherefore I say, Take only the rose-coloured blood from the Lion and the gluten from the Eagle. When you have mixed these, coagulate them according to the old process, and you will have the Tincture of the Philosophers, which an infinite number have sought after and very few have found. Whether you will or not, sophist, this Magistery is in Nature itself, a wonderful thing of God above Nature, and a most precious treasure in this Valley of Sorrows. If you look at it from without it seems a paltry thing to transmute another into something far more noble than it was before. But you must, nevertheless, allow this, and confess that it is a miracle produced by the Spagyrist, who by the art of his preparation corrupts a visible body which is externally vile, from which he excites another most noble and most precious essence. If you, in like manner, have learnt anything from the light of Aristotle, or from us, or from the rules of Serapio, come forth, and bring that knowledge experimentally to light. Preserve now the right of the Schools, as becomes a lover of honour and a doctor. But if you know nothing and can do nothing, why do you despise me as though I were an irrational Helvetian cow, and inveigh against me as a wandering vagabond? Art is a second Nature and a universe of its own, as experience witnesses, and demonstrates against you and your idols. Sometimes, therefore, the Alchemist compounds certain simples, which he afterwards corrupts according to his need, and prepares thence another thing. For thus very often out of many things one is made, which effects more than Nature of herself can do, as in Gastaynum it is perfectly well known that Venus is produced from Saturn; in Carinthia, Luna out of Venus; and in Hungary, Sol out of Luna; to pass over in silence for the time being the transmutations of other natural objects, which were well known to the Magi, and more wonderfully than Ovid narrates in his Metamorphoses do they come to the light. That you may rightly understand me, seek your Lion in the East, and your Eagle in the South, for this our work which has been undertaken. You will not find better instruments than Hungary and Istria produce. But if you desire to lead from unity by duality in trinity with equal permutation of each, then you should direct your journey to the South; so in Cyprus shall you gain all your desire, concerning which we must not dilate more profusely than we have done at present. There are still many more of these arcana which exhibit transmutations, though they are known to few. And although these may by the Lord God be made manifest to anyone, still, the rumour of this Art does not on that account at once break forth, but the Almighty gives therewith the understanding how to conceal these and other like arts even to the coming of Elias the Artist, at which time there shall be nothing so occult that it shall not be revealed. You also see with your eyes (though there is no need to speak of these things, which may be taken derisively by some) that in the fire of Sulphur is a great tincture for gems, which, indeed, exalts them to a loftier degree than Nature by herself could do. But this gradation of metals and gems shall be omitted by me in this place, since I have written sufficiently about it in my Secret of Secrets, in my book on the Vexations of Alchemists, and abundantly elsewhere. As I have begun the process of our ancestors with the Tincture of the Philosophers, I will now perfectly conclude it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-v:-concerning-the-conclusion-of-the-process-of-the-ancients.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER V: CONCERNING THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCESS OF THE ANCIENTS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-v:-concerning-the-conclusion-of-the-process-of-the-ancients.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Lastly, the ancient Spagyrists having placed Lili in a pelican and dried it, fixed it by means of a regulated increase of the fire, continued so long until from blackness, by permutation into all the colours, it became red as blood, and therewith assumed the condition of a salamander. Rightly, indeed, did they proceed with such labour, and in the same way it is right and becoming that everyone should proceed who seeks this pearl. It will be very difficult for me to make this clearer to you unless you shall have learnt in the School of the Alchemists to observe the degrees of the fire, and also to change your vessels. For then at length you will see that soon after your Lili shall have become heated in the Philosophic Egg, it becomes, with wonderful appearances, blacker than the crow; afterwards, in succession of time, whiter than the swan; and at last, passing through a yellow colour, it turns out more red than any blood. Seek, seek, says the first Spagyrist, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. It would be impious and indecorous to put food in the mouth of a perfidious bird. Let her rather fly to it, even as I, with others before me, have been compelled to do. But follow true Art; for this will lead you to its perfect knowledge. It is not possible that anything should here be set down more fully or more clearly than I have before spoken. Let your Pharisaical schools teach you what they will from their unstable and slippery foundation, which reaches not its end or its aim. When at length you shall have been taught as accurately as possible the Alchemistic Art, nothing in the nature of things shall then at length be so difficult which cannot be made manifest to you by the aid of this Art. Nature, indeed, herself does not bring forth anything into the light which is advanced to its highest perfection, as can be seen in this place from the unity, or the union, of our duality. But a man ought by Spagyric preparations to lead it thither where it was ordained by Nature. Let this have been sufficiently said by me, concerning the process of the ancients and my correction of the Tincture of the Philosophers, so far as relates to its preparation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, since now we have that treasure of the Egyptians in our hands, it remains that we turn it to our use: and this is offered to us by the Spagyric Magistery in two ways. According to the former mode it can be applied for the renewing of the body; according to the latter it is to be used for the transmutation of metals. Since, then, I, Theophrastus Paracelsus, have tried each of them in different ways, I am willing to put them forward and to describe them according to the signs indeed of the work, and as in experience and proof they appeared to me better and more perfectly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-vi:-concerning-the-transmutation-of-metals-by-the-perfection-of-medicine.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER VI: CONCERNING THE TRANSMUTATION OF METALS BY THE PERFECTION OF MEDICINE. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-vi:-concerning-the-transmutation-of-metals-by-the-perfection-of-medicine.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If the Tincture of the Philosophers is to be used for transmutation, a pound of it must be projected on a thousand pounds of melted Sol. Then, at length, will a Medicine have been prepared for transmuting the leprous moisture of the metals. This work is a wonderful one in the light of Nature, namely, that by the Magistery, or the operation of the Spagyrist, a metal, which formerly existed, should perish, and another be produced. This fact has rendered that same Aristotle, with his ill-founded philosophy, fatuous. For truly, when the rustics in Hungary cast iron at the proper season into a certain fountain, commonly called Zifferbrunnen, it is consumed into rust, and when this is liquefied with a blast-fire, it soon exists as pure Venus, and never more returns to iron. Similarly, in the mountain commonly called Kuttenberg, they obtain a lixivium out of marcasites, in which iron is forthwith turned into Venus of a high grade, and more malleable than the other produced by Nature. These things, and more like them, are known to simple men rather than to sophists, namely, those which turn one appearance of a metal into another. And these things, moreover, through the remarkable contempt of the ignorant, and partly, too, on account of the just envy of the artificers, remain almost hidden. But I myself, in Istria, have often brought Venus to more than twenty-four (al. 38) degrees, so that the colour of Sol could not mount higher, consisting of Antimony or or Quartal, which Venus I used in all respects as other kinds.</p>\n<p>But though the old artists were very desirous of this arcanum, and sought it with the greatest diligence, nevertheless, very few could bring it by means of a perfect preparation to its end. For the transmutation of an inferior metal into a superior one brings with it many difficulties and obstacles, as the change of Jove into Luna, or Venus into Sol. Perhaps on account of their sins God willed that the Magnalia of Nature should be hidden from many men. For sometimes, when this Tincture has been prepared by artists, and they were not able to reduce their projection to work its effects, it happened that, by their carelessness and bad guardianship, this was eaten up by fowls, whose feathers thereupon fell off, and, as I myself have seen, grew again. In this way transmutation, through its abuse from the carelessness of the artists, came into Medicine and Alchemy. For when they were unable to use the Tincture according to their desire, they converted the same to the renovation of men, as shall be heard more at large in the following chapter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-vii:-concerning-the-renovation-of-men.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER VII: CONCERNING THE RENOVATION OF MEN. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-vii:-concerning-the-renovation-of-men.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Some of the first and primitive philosophers of Egypt have lived by means of this Tincture for a hundred and fifty years. The life of many, too, has been extended and prolonged to several centuries, as is most clearly shewn in different histories, though it seems scarcely credible to any one. For its power is so remarkable that it extends the life of the body beyond what is possible to its congenital nature, and keeps it so firmly in that condition that it lives on in safety from all infirmities. And although, indeed, the body at length comes to old age, nevertheless, it still appears as though it were established in its primal youth.</p>\n<p>So, then, the Tincture of the Philosophers is a Universal Medicine, and consumes all diseases, by whatsoever name they are called, just like an invisible fire. The dose is very small, but its effect is most powerful. By means thereof I have cured the leprosy, venereal disease, dropsy, the falling sickness, colic, scab, and similar afflictions; also lupus, cancer, noli-me-tangere, fistulas, and the whole race of internal diseases, more surely than one could believe. Of this fact Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Bohemia, etc., will afford the most ample evidence.</p>\n<p>Now, Sophist, look at Theophrastus Paracelsus. How can your Apollo, Machaon, and Hippocrates stand against me? This is the Catholicum of the Philosophers, by which all these philosophers have attained long life for resisting diseases, and they have attained this end entirely and most effectually, and so, according to their judgment, they named it The Tincture of the Philosophers. For what can there be in the whole range of medicine greater than such purgation of the body, by means whereof all superfluity is radically removed from it and transmuted? For when the seed is once made sound all else is perfected. What avails the ill-founded purgation of the sophists since it removes nothing as it ought? This, therefore, is the most excellent foundation of a true physician, the regeneration of the nature, and the restoration of youth. After this, the new essence itself drives out all that is opposed to it. To effect this regeneration, the powers and virtues of the Tincture of the Philosophers were miraculously discovered, and up to this time have been used in secret and kept concealed by true Spagyrists.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes\" tabindex=\"-1\">NOTES <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#notes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Arcanum of a substance is not the virtue (virtus) but the essence (vir) and the potency (potentia), and is stronger than the virtue; nevertheless, an old error of the doctors conferred the name of virtues upon the potential essences. - Paramirum, Lib. IV. Many things are elsewhere set forth concerning the Quintessence, but what is described is really a separation or extraction of the pure from the impure, not a true quintessence, and it is more correctly termed an Arcanum. -Explicatio Totius Astronomiae.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The office of Vulcan is the separation of the good from the bad. So the Art of Vulcan, which is Alchemy, is like unto death, by which the eternal and the temporal are divided one from another. So also this art might be called the death of things. - De Morbis Metallicis, Lib. I., Tract III., c. 1. Vulcan is an astral and not a corporal fabricator. - De Caduco Matricis, Par. VI. The artist working in metals and other minerals transforms them into other colours, and in so doing his operation is like that of the heaven itself. For as the artist excocts by means of Vulcan, or the igneous element, so heaven performs the work of coction through the Sun. The Sun, therefore, is the Vulcan of heaven accomplishing coction in the earth. - De Icteritiis. Vulcan is the fabricator and architect of all things, nor is his habitation in heaven only, that is, in the firmament, but equally in all the other elements. - Lib. Meteorum, c. 4. Where the three prime principles are wanting, there also the igneous essence is absent. The Igneous Vulcan is nothing else but Sulphur, Sal Nitrum, and Mercury. - Ibid., c.5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Book of the Revelation of Hermes, interpreted by Theophrastus Paracelsus, concerning the Supreme Secret of the World, seems to have been first brought to light by Benedictus Figulus, and appeared as a piece de résistance in his &quot;Golden and Blessed Casket of Nature's Marvels&quot;, of which an English translation has been very recently published. (&quot;A Golden and Blessed Casket of Nature's Marvels&quot;. By Benedictus Figulus. Now first done into English from the German original published at Frankfort in the year 1608. London: James Elliott and Co. 8vo., 1893). Among the many writings which have been fabulously attributed to Hermes, there does not seem to be any record of an apocalypse, and it is impossible to say what forged document may have been the subject of interpretation by Paracelsus. As the collection of Figulus is now so readily accessible, it is somewhat superfluous to reproduce the treatise here, but since this translation claims to include everything written by the physician of Hohenheim on the subject of Alchemy and the Universal Medicine, it is appended at this point. It should be premised that Benedictus Figulus complains bitterly of the mutilation and perversion to which the works of Paracelsus were subjected, and the Revelation of Hermes seems in many parts to betray another hand, especially in its quotation of authorities who are not countenanced by its reputed author. Hermes, Plato, Aristotle, and other philosophers, flourishing at different times, who have introduced the Arts, and more especially have explored the secrets of inferior Creation, all these have eagerly sought a means whereby man's body might be preserved from decay and become endued with immortality. To them it was answered that there is nothing which might deliver the mortal body from death; but that there is One Thing which may postpone decay, renew youth; and prolong short human life (as with the patriarchs). For death was laid as a punishment upon our first parents, Adam and Eve, and will never depart from all their descendants. Therefore, the above philosophers, and many others, have sought this One Thing with great labour, and have found that that which preserves the human body from corruption, and prolongs life, conducts itself, with respect to other elements, as it were like the Heavens; from which they understood that the Heavens are a substance above the Four Elements. And just as the Heavens, with respect to the other elements, are held to be the fifth substance (for they are indestructible, stable, and suffer no foreign admixture), so also this One Thing (compared to the forces of our body) is an indestructible essence, drying up all the superfluities of our bodies, and has been philosophically called by the above-mentioned name. It is neither hot and dry like fire, nor cold and moist like water, nor warm and moist like air, nor dry and cold like earth. But it is a skilful, perfect equation of all the Elements, a right commingling of natural forces, a most particular union of spiritual virtues, an indissoluble uniting of body and soul. It is the purest and noblest substance of an indestructible body, which cannot be destroyed nor harmed by the Elements, and is produced by Art. With this, Aristotle prepared an apple, prolonging life by its scent, when he, fifteen days before his death, could neither eat nor drink on account of old age. This spiritual Essence, or One Thing, was revealed from above to Adam, and was greatly desired by the Holy Fathers; this also Hermes and Aristotle call the Truth without Lies, the most sure of all things certain, the Secret of all Secrets. It is the Last and the Highest Thing to be sought under the Heavens, a wondrous closing and finish of philosophical work, by which are discovered the dews of Heaven and the fastnesses of Earth. What the mouth of man cannot utter is all found in this spirit. As Morienus says: &quot;He who has this has all things, and wants no other aid. For in it are all temporal happiness, bodily health, and earthly fortune. It is the spirit of the fifth substance, a Fount of all Joys ( beneath the rays of the moon), the Supporter of Heaven and Earth, the Mover of Sea and Wind, the Outpourer of Rain, upholding the strength of all things, an excellent spirit above Heavenly and other spirits, giving Health, Joy, Peace, Love; driving away Hatred and Sorrow, bringing in Joy, expelling all Evil, quickly healing all Diseases, destroying Poverty and misery, leading to all good things, preventing all evil words and thoughts, giving man his heart's desire, bringing to the pious earthly honour and long life, but to the wicked who misuse it, Eternal Punishment&quot;. This is the Spirit of Truth, which the world cannot comprehend without the interposition of the Holy Ghost, or without the instruction of those who know it. The same is of a mysterious nature, wondrous strength, boundless power. The Saints, from the beginning of the world, have desired to behold its face. By Avicenna this Spirit is named the Soul of the World. For, as the Soul moves all the limbs of the body, so also does this Spirit move all bodies. And as the Soul is in all the limbs of the Body, so also is this Spirit in all elementary created things. It is sought by many and found by few. It is beheld from afar and found near; for it exists in every thing, in every place, and at all times. It has the powers of all creatures; its action is found in all elements, and the qualities of all things are therein, even in the highest perfection. By virtue of this essence did Adam and the Patriarchs preserve their health and live to an extreme age, some of them also flourishing in great riches. When the philosophers had discovered it, with great diligence and labour, they straightway concealed it under a strange tongue, and in parables, lest the same should become known to the unworthy, and the pearls be cast before swine. For if everyone knew it, all work and industry would cease; man would desire nothing but this one thing, people would live wickedly, and the world be ruined, seeing that they would provoke God by reason of their avarice and superfluity. For eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath the heart of man understood what Heaven hath naturally incorporated with this Spirit. Therefore have I briefly enumerated some of the qualities of this Spirit, to the Honour of God, that the pious may reverently praise Him in His gifts (which gift of God shall afterwards come to them), and I will herewith shew what powers and virtues it possesses in each thing, also its outward appearance, that it may be more readily recognised. In its first state, it appears as an impure earthly body, full of imperfections. It then has an earthly nature, healing all sickness and wounds in the bowels of man, producing good and consuming proud flesh, expelling all stench, and healing generally, inwardly and outwardly. In its second nature, it appears as a watery body, somewhat more beautiful than before, because (although still having its corruptions) its Virtue is greater. It is much nearer the truth, and more effective in works. In this form it cures cold and hot fevers and is a specific against poisons, which it drives from heart and lungs, healing the same when injured or wounded, purifying the blood, and, taken three times a day, is of great comfort in all diseases. But in its third nature it appears as an aerial body, of an oily nature, almost freed from all imperfections, in which form it does many wondrous works, producing beauty and strength of body, and (a small quantity being taken in the food) preventing melancholy and heating of the gall, increasing the quantity of the blood and seed, so that frequent bleeding becomes necessary. It expands the blood vessels, cures withered limbs, restores strength to the sight, in growing persons removes what is superfluous and makes good defects in the limbs. In its fourth nature it appears in a fiery form (not quite freed from all imperfections, still somewhat watery and not dried enough), wherein it has many virtues, making the old young and reviving those at the point of death. For if to such an one there be given, in wine, a barleycorn's weight of this fire, so that it reach the stomach, it goes to his heart, renewing him at once, driving away all previous moisture and poison, and restoring the natural heat of the liver. Given in small doses to old people, it removes the diseases of age, giving the old young hearts and bodies. Hence it is called the Elixir of Life. In its fifth and last nature, it appears in a glorified and illuminated form, without defects, shining like gold and silver, wherein it possesses all previous powers and virtues in a higher and more wondrous degree. Here its natural works are taken for miracles. When applied to the roots of dead trees they revive, bringing forth leaves and fruit. A lamp, the oil of which is mingled with this spirit, continues to burn for ever without diminution. It converts crystals into the most precious stones of all colours, equal to those from the mines, and does mayn other incredible wonders which may not be revealed to the unworthy. For it heals all dead and living bodies without other medicine. Here Christ is my witness that I lie not, for all heavenly influences are united and combined therein. This essence also reveals all treasures in earth and sea, converts all metallic bodies into gold, and there is nothing like unto it under Heaven. This spirit is the secret hidden from the beginning, yet granted by God to a few holy men for the revealing of these iches to His Glory - dwelling in fiery form in the air, and leading earth with itself to heaven, while from its body there flow whole rivers of living water. This spirit flies through the midst of the Heavens like a morning mist, leads its burning fire into the water, and has its shining realm in the heavens. And although these writings may be regarded as false by the reader, yet to the initiated they are true and possible, when the hidden sense is properly understood. For God is wonderful in His works, and His wisdom is without end. This spirit in its fiery form is called a Sandaraca, in the aerial a Kybrick, in the watery an Azoth, in the earthly Alcohoph and Aliocosoph. Hence they are deceived by these names who, seeking without instruction, think to find this Spirit of Life in things foreign to our Art. For although this spirit which we seek, on account of its qualities, is called by these names, yet the same is not in these bodies and cannot be in them. For a refined spirit cannot appear except in a body suitable to its nature. And, by however many names it be called, let no one imagine there be different spirits, for, say what one will, there is but one spirit working everywhere and in all things. That is the spirit which, when rising, illumines the Heavens, when setting incorporates the purity of Earth, and when brooding has embraced the Waters. This spirit is named Raphael, the Angel of God, the subtlest and purest, whom the others all obey as their King. This spiritual substance is neither heavenly nor hellish, but an airy, pure, and hearty body, midway between the highest and lowest, without reason, but fruitful in works, and the most select and beautiful of all other heavenly things. This work of God is far too deep for understanding, for it is the last, greatest, and highest secret of Nature. It is the Spirit of God, which in the Beginning filled the earth and brooded over the waters, which the world cannot grasp without the gracious interposition of the Holy Spirit and instruction from those who know it, which also the whole world desires for its virtue, and which cannot be prized enough. For it reaches to the planets, raises the clouds, drives away mists, gives its light to all things, turns everything into Sun and Moon, bestows all health and abundance of treasure, cleanses the leper, brightens the eyes, banishes sorrow, heals the sick, reveals all hidden treasures, and, generally, cures all diseases. Through this spirit have the philosophers invented the Seven Liberal Arts, and thereby gained their riches. Through the same Moses made the golden vessels in the Ark, and King Solomon did many beautiful works to the honour of God. Therewith Moses built the Tabernacle, Noah the Ark, Solomon the Temple. By this, Ezra restored the Law, and Miriam, Moses' sister, was hospitable; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and other righteous men, have had lifelong abundance and riches; and all the saints possessing it have therewith praised God. Therefore is its acquisition very hard, more than that of gold and silver. For it is the best of all things, because, of all things mortal that man can desire in this world, nothing can compare with it, and in it alone is truth. Hence it is called the Stone and Spirit of Truth; in its works is no vanity, its praise cannot be sufficiently expressed. I am unable to speak enough of its virtues, because its good qualities and powers are beyond human thoughts, unutterable by the tongue of man, and in it are found the properties of all things. Yea, there is nothing deeper in Nature. O unfathomable abyss of God's Wisdom, which thus hath united and comprised in the virtue and power of this One Spirit the qualities of all existing bodies! O unspeakable honour and boundless joy granted to mortal man! For the destructible things of Nature are restored by virtue of the said Spirit. O mystery of mysteries, most secret of all secret things, and healing and medicine of all things! Thou last discovery in earthly natures, last best gift to Patriarchs and Sages, greatly desired by the whole world! Oh, what a wondrous and laudable spirit is purity, in which stand all joy, riches, fruitfulness of life, and art of all arts, a power which to its initiates grants all material joys! O desirable knowledge, lovely above all things beneath the circle of the Moon, by which Nature is strengthened, and heart and limbs are renewed, blooming youth is preserved, old age driven away, weakness destroyed, beauty in its perfection preserved, and abundance ensured in all things pleasing to men! O thou spiritual substance, lovely above all things! O thou wondrous power, strengthening all the world! O thou invincible virtue, highest of all that is, although despised by the ignorant, yet held by the wise in great praise, honour, and glory, that - proceeding from humours - wakest the dead, expellest diseases, restorest the voice of the dying! O thou treasure of treasures, mystery of mysteries, called by Avicenna &quot;an unspeakable substance&quot;, the purest and most perfect soul of the world, than which there is nothing more costly under Heaven, unfathomable in nature and power, wonderful in virtue and works, having no equal among creatures, possessing the virtues of all bodies under Heaven! For from it flow the water of life, the oil and honey of eternal healing, and thus hath it nourished them with honey and water from the rock. Therefore, saith Morienus: &quot;He who hath it, the same also hath all things&quot;. Blessed art Thou, Lord God of our Fathers, in that Thou hast given the prophets this knowledge and understanding, that they have hidden these things (lest they should be discovered by the blind, and those drowned in worldly godlessness) by which the wise and the pious have praised Thee! For the discoverers of the mystery of this thing to the unworthy are breakers of the seal of Heavenly Revelation, thereby offending God's Majesty, and bringing upon themselves many misfortunes and the punishments of God. Therefore, I beg all Christians, possessing this knowledge, to communicate the same to nobody, except it be to one living in Godliness, of well-proved virtue, and praising God, Who has given such a treasure to man. For many seek, but few find it. Hence the impure and those living in vice are unworthy of it. Therefore is this Art to be shewn to all God-fearing persons, because it cannot be bought with a price. I testify before God that I lie not, although it appear impossible to fools, that no one has hitherto explored Nature so deeply. The Almighty be praised for having created this Art and for revealing it to God-fearing men. Amen. And thus is fulfilled this precious and excellent work, called the revealing of the occult spirit, in which lie hidden the secrets and mysteries of the world. But this spirit is one genius, and divine, wonderful, and lordly power. For it embraces the whole world, and overcomes the Elements and the fifth Substance. To our Trismegistus Spagyrus, Jesus Christ, be praise and glory immortal. Amen.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"the-treasure-of-treasures-for-alchemists-by-paracelsus\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Treasure of Treasures for Alchemists by Paracelsus <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-treasure-of-treasures-for-alchemists-by-paracelsus\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<p>` By Philippus Theophrastus Bombast, Paracelsus the Great</p>\n<p>NATURE begets a mineral in the bowels of the earth. There are two kinds of it, which are found in many districts of Europe. The best which has been offered to me, which also has been found genuine in experimentation, is externally in the figure of the greater world, and is in the eastern part of the sphere of the Sun. The other, in the Southern Star, is now in its first efflorescence. The bowels of the earth thrust this forth through its surface. It is found red in its first coagulation, and in it lie hid all the flowers and colours of the minerals. Much has been written about it by the philosophers, for it is of a cold and moist nature, and agrees with the element of water.</p>\n<p>So far as relates to the knowledge of it and experiment with it, all the philosophers before me, though they have aimed at it with their missiles, have gone very wide of the mark. They believed that Mercury and Sulphur were the mother of all metals, never even dreaming of making mention meanwhile of a third; and yet when the water is separated from it by Spagyric Art the truth is plainly revealed, though it was unknown to Galen or to Avicenna. But if, for the sake of our excellent physicians, we had to describe only the name, the composition; the dissolution, and coagulation, as in the beginning of the world Nature proceeds with all growing things, a whole year would scarcely suffice me, and, in order to explain these things, not even the skins of numerous cows would be adequate.</p>\n<p>Now, I assert that in this mineral are found three principles, which are Mercury, Sulphur, and the Mineral Water which has served to naturally coagulate it. Spagyric science is able to extract this last from its proper juice when it is not altogether matured, in the middle of the autumn, just like a pear from a tree. The tree potentially contains the pear. If the Celestial Stars and Nature agree , the tree first of all puts forth shoots in the month of March; then it thrusts out buds, and when these open the flower appears, and so on in due order until in autumn the pear grows ripe. So is it with the minerals. These are born, in like manner, in the bowels of the earth. Let the Alchemists who are seeking the Treasure of Treasures carefully note this. I will shew them the way, its beginning, its middle, and its end. In the following treatise I will describe the proper Water, the proper Sulphur, and the proper Balm thereof. By means of these three the resolution and composition are coagulated into one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"concerning-the-sulphur-of-cinnabar.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CONCERNING THE SULPHUR OF CINNABAR. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#concerning-the-sulphur-of-cinnabar.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Take mineral Cinnabar and prepare it in the following manner. Cook it with rain water in a stone vessel for three hours. Then purify it carefully, and dissolve it in Aqua Regis, which is composed of equal parts of vitriol, nitre, and sal ammoniac. Another formula is vitriol, saltpetre, alum, and common salt.</p>\n<p>Distil this in an alembic. Pour it on again, and separate carefully the pure from the impure thus. Let it putrefy for a month in horse-dung; then separate the elements in the following manner. If it puts forth its sign1, commence the distillation by means of an alembic with a fire of the first degree. The water and the air will ascend; the fire and the earth will remain at the bottom. Afterwards join them again, and gradually treat with the ashes. So the water and the air will again ascend first, and afterwards the element of fire, which expert artists recognise. The earth will remain in the bottom of the vessel. This collect there. It is what many seek after and few find.</p>\n<p>This dead earth in the reverberatory you will prepare according to the rules of Art, and afterwards add fire of the first degree for five days and nights. When these have elapsed you must apply the second degree for the same number of days and nights, and proceed according to Art with the material enclosed. At length you will find a volatile salt, like a thin alkali, containing in itself the Astrum of fire and earth2. Mix this with the two elements that have been preserved, the water and the earth. Again place it on the ashes for eight days and eight nights, and you will find that which has been neglected by many Artists. Separate this according to your experience, and according to the rules of the Spagyric Art, and you will have a white earth, from which its colour has been extracted. Join the element of fire and salt to the alkalised earth. Digest in a pelican to extract the essence. Then a new earth will be deposited, which put aside.</p>\n<h2 id=\"concerning-the-red-lion.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CONCERNING THE RED LION. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#concerning-the-red-lion.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Afterwards take the lion in the pelican which also is found [at] first, when you see its tincture, that is to say, the element of fire which stands above the water, the air, and the earth. Separate it from its deposit by trituration. Thus you will have the true aurum potabile3. Sweeten this with the alcohol of wine poured over it, and then distil in an alembic until you perceive no acidity to remain in the Aqua Regia.</p>\n<p>This Oil of the Sun, enclosed in a retort hermetically sealed, you must place for elevation that it may be exalted and doubled in its degree. Then put the vessel, still closely shut, in a cool place. Thus it will not be dissolved, but coagulated. Place it again for elevation and coagulation, and repeat this three times. Thus will be produced the Tincture of the Sun, perfect in its degree. Keep this in its own place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"concerning-the-green-lion.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CONCERNING THE GREEN LION. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#concerning-the-green-lion.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Take the vitriol of Venus4, carefully prepared according to the rules of Spagyric Art; and add thereto the elements of water and air which you have reserved. Resolve, and set to putrefy for a month according to instructions. When the putrefaction is finished, you will behold the sign of the elements. Separate, and you will soon see two colours, namely, white and red. The red is above the white. The red tincture of the vitriol is so powerful that it reddens all white bodies, and whitens all red ones, which is wonderful.</p>\n<p>Work upon this tincture by means of a retort, and you will perceive a blackness issue forth. Treat it again by means of the retort, repeating the operation until it comes out whitish. Go on, and do not despair of the work. Rectify until you find the true, clear Green Lion, which you will recognise by its great weight. You will see that it is heavy and large. This is the Tincture, transparent gold. You will see marvellous signs of this Green Lion, such as could be bought by no treasures of the Roman Leo. Happy he who has learnt how to find it and use it for a tincture!</p>\n<p>This is the true and genuine Balsam5, the Balsam of the Heavenly Stars, suffering no bodies to decay, nor allowing leprosy, gout, or dropsy to take root. It is given in a dose of one grain, if it has been fermented with Sulphur of Gold.</p>\n<p>Ah, Charles the German, where is your treasure? Where are your philosophers? Where your doctors? Where are your decocters of woods, who at least purge and relax? Is your heaven reversed? Have your stars wandered out of their course, and are they straying in another orbit, away from the line of limitation, since your eyes are smitten with blindness, as by a carbuncle, and other things making a show of ornament, beauty, and pomp? If your artists only knew that their prince Galen - they call none like him - was sticking in hell, from whence he has sent letters to me, they would make the sign of the cross upon themselves with a fox's tail. In the same way your Avicenna sits in the vestibule of the infernal portal; and I have disputed with him about his aurum potabile, his Tincture of the Philosophers, his Quintessence, and Philosophers' Stone, his Mithridatic, his Theriac, and all the rest. O, you hypocrites, who despise the truths taught you by a true physician, who is himself instructed by Nature, and is a son of God himself! Come, then, and listen, impostors who prevail only by the authority of your high positions! After my death, my disciples will burst forth and drag you to the light, and shall expose your dirty drugs, wherewith up to this time you have compassed the death of princes, and the most invincible magnates of the Christian world. Woe for your necks in the day of judgment! I know that the monarchy will be mine. Mine, too, will be the honour and glory. Not that I praise myself: Nature praises me. Of her I am born; her I follow. She knows me, and I know her. The light which is in her I have beheld in her; outside, too, I have proved the same in the figure of the microcosm, and found it in that universe.</p>\n<p>But I must proceed with my design in order to satisfy my disciples to the full extent of their wish. I willingly do this for them, if only skilled in the light of Nature and thoroughly practised in astral matters, they finally become adepts in philosophy, which enables them to know the nature of every kind of water.</p>\n<p>Take, then, of this liquid of the minerals which I have described, four parts by weight; of the Earth of red Sol two parts; of Sulphur of Sol one part. Put these together into a pelican, congelate, and dissolve them three times. Thus you will have the Tincture of the Alchemists. We have not here described its weight: but this is given in the book on Transmutations6.</p>\n<p>So, now, he who has one to a thousand ounces of the Astrum Solis shall also tinge his own body of Sol.</p>\n<p>If you have the Astrum of Mercury, in the same manner, you will tinge the whole body of common Mercury. If you have the Astrum of Venus you will, in like manner, tinge the whole body of Venus, and change it into the best metal. These facts have all been proved. The same must also be understood as to the Astra of the other planets, as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Luna, and the rest. For tinctures are also prepared from these: concerning which we now make no mention in this place, because we have already dwelt at sufficient length upon them in the book on the Nature of Things and in the Archidoxies. So, too, the first entity of metals and terrestrial minerals have been made, sufficiently clear for Alchemists to enable them to get the Alchemists' Tincture.</p>\n<p>This work, the Tincture of the Alchemists, need not be one of nine months; but quickly, and without any delay, you may go on by the Spaygric Art of the Alchemists, and, in the space of forty days, you can fix this alchemical substance, exalt it, putrefy it, ferment it, coagulate it into a stone, and produce the Alchemical Phoenix7. But it should be noted well that the Sulphur of Cinnabar becomes the Flying Eagle, whose wings fly away without wind, and carry the body of the phoenix to the nest of the parent, where it is nourished by the element of fire, and the young ones dig out its eyes: from whence there emerges a whiteness, divided in its sphere, into a sphere and life out of its own heart, by the balsam of its inward parts, according to the property of the cabalists.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes-1\" tabindex=\"-1\">NOTES <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#notes-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Sign is nothing else than the mark left by an operation. The house constructed by the architect is the sign of his handicraft whereby his skill and art are determined. Thus the sign is the achievement itself. - De Colica.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The earth also has its Astrum, its course, its order, just as much as the Firmament, but peculiar to the element. So also there is an Astrum in the water, even as in the earth, and in like manner with air and fire. Consequently, the upper Astrum has the Astra of the elements for its medium and operates through them by an irresistible attraction. Through this operation of the superior and inferior Astra, all things are fecundated, and led on to their end. - Explicatio Totius Astronomiae. Without the Astra the elements cannot flourish. ... In the Astrum of the earth all the celestial operations thrive. The Astrum itself is hidden, the bodies are manifest. ... The motion of the earth is brought about by the Astrum of the earth. ... There are four Astra in man (corresponding to those of the four elements), for he is the lesser world. - De Caducis, Par. II.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aurum Potabile, that is, Potable Gold, Oil of Gold, and Quintessence of Gold, are distinguished thus. Aurum Potabile is gold rendered potable by intermixture with other substances, and with liquids. Oil of Gold is an oil extracted from the precious metal without the addition of anything. The Quintessence of Gold is the redness of gold extracted therefrom and separated from the body of the metal. - De Membris Contractis, Tract II., c. 2.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If copper be pounded and resolved without a corrosive, you have Vitriol. From this may be prepared the quintessence, oil, and liquor thereof. - De Morbis Tartareis. Cuprine Vitriol is Vitriol cooked with Copper. - De Morbis Vermium, Par. 6. Chalcanthum is present in Venus, and Venus can by separation be reduced into Chalcanthum. - Chirurgia Magna. Pars. III., Lib. IV.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is, indeed, diffused through all things a Balsam created by God, without which putrefaction would immediately supervene. Thus in corpses which are anointed with Balsam we see that corruption is arrested and thus in the physical body we infer that there is a certain natural and congenital Balsam, in the absence of which the living and complete man would not be safe from putrefaction. Nothing removes the Balsam but death. But this kind differs from what is more commonly called Balsam, in that the one is conservative of the living, and the other of the dead. - Chirurgia Magna, Pt.

Thence he predicted the world’s destruction by water. From this cause, too, it came about that his successors erected two tables of stone, on which they engraved all natural arts in hieroglyphical characters, in order that their posterity might also become acquainted with this prediction, that so it might be heeded, and provision made in the time of danger. Subsequently, Noah found one of these tables under Mount Araroth, after the Deluge. In this table were described the courses of the upper firmament and of the lower globe, and also of the planets. At length this universal knowledge was divided into several parts, and lessened in its vigour and power. By means of this separation, one man became an astronomer, another a magician, another a cabalist, and a fourth an alchemist. Abraham, that Vulcanic Tubalcain, a consummate astrologer and arithmetician, carried the Art out of the land of Canaan into Egypt, whereupon the Egyptians rose to so great a height and dignity that this wisdom was derived from them by other nations. The patriarch Jacob painted, as it were, the sheep with various colours; and this was done by magic: for in the theology of the Chaldeans, Hebrews, Persians, and Egyptians, they held these arts to be the highest philosophy, to be learnt by their chief nobles and priests. So it was in the time of Moses, when both thc priests and also thc physicians were chosen from among the Magi – the priests for the judgment of what related to health, especially in the knowledge of leprosy. Moses, likewise, was instructed in the Egyptian schools, at the cost and care of Pharaoh’s daughter, so that he excelled in all the wisdom and learning of that people. Thus, too, was it with Daniel, who in his youthful days imbibed the learning of the Chaldeans, so that he became a cabalist. Witness his divine predictions and his exposition of those words, &quot;Mene, Mene, Tecelphares&quot;. These words can be understood by the prophetic and cabalistic Art. This cabalistic Art was perfectly familiar to, and in constant use by, Moses and the Prophets. The Prophet Elias foretold many things by his cabalistic numbers. So did the Wise Men of old, by this natural and mystical Art, learn to know God rightly. They abode in His laws, and walked in His statutes with great firmness. It is also evident in the Book of Samuel, that the Berelists did not follow the devil’s part, but became, by Divine permission, partakers of visions and veritable apparitions, whereof we shall treat more at large in the Book of Supercelestial Things<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\">[26]</a></sup>. This gift is granted by the Lord God to those priests who walk in the Divine precepts. It was a custom among the Persians never to admit any one as king unless he were a Wise Man, pre-eminent in reality as well as in name. This is clear from the customary name of their kings; for they were called Wise Men. Such were those Wise Men and Persian Magi who came from the East to seek out thc Lord Jesus, and are called natural priests. The Egyptians, also, having obtained this magic and philosophy from the Chaldeans and Persians, desired that their priests should learn the same wisdom; and they became so fruitful and successful therein that all the neighbouring countries admired them. For this reason Hermes was so truly named Trismegistus, because he was a king, a priest, a prophet, a magician, and a sophist of natural things. Such another was Zoroaster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-ii:-wherein-is-declared-that-the-greeks-drew-a-large-part-of-their-learning-from-the-egyptians-and-how-it-came-from-them-to-us.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER II: WHEREIN IS DECLARED THAT THE GREEKS DREW A LARGE PART OF THEIR LEARNING FROM THE EGYPTIANS; AND HOW IT CAME FROM THEM TO US. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-ii:-wherein-is-declared-that-the-greeks-drew-a-large-part-of-their-learning-from-the-egyptians-and-how-it-came-from-them-to-us.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>When a son of Noah possessed the third part of the world after the Flood, this Art broke into Chaldaea and Persia, and thence spread into Egypt. The Art having been found out by the superstitious and idolatrous Greeks, some of them who were wiser than the rest betook themselves to the Chaldeans and Egyptians, so that they might draw the same wisdom from their schools. Since, however, the theological study of the law of Moses did not satisfy them, they trusted to their own peculiar genius, and fell away from the right foundation of those natural secrets and arts. This is evident from their fabulous conceptions, and from their errors respecting the doctrine of Moses. It was the custom of the Egyptians to put forward the traditions of that surpassing wisdom only in enigmatical figures and abstruse histories and terms. This was afterwards followed by Homer with marvellous poetical skill; and Pythagoras was also acquainted with it, seeing that he comprised in his writings many things out of the law of Moses and the Old Testament. In like manner, Hippocrates, Thales of Miletus, Anaxagoras, Democritus, and others, did not scruple to fix their minds on the same subject. And yet none of them were practised in the true Astrology, Geometry, Arithmetic, or Medicine, because their pride prevented this, since they would not admit disciples belonging to other nations than their own. Even when they had got some insight from the Chaldeans and Egyptians, they became more arrogant still than they were before by Nature, and without any diffidence propounded the subject substantially indeed, but mixed with subtle fictions or falsehoods; and then they attempted to elaborate a certain kind of philosophy which descended from them to the Latins. These in their turn, being educated herewith, adorned it with their own doctrines, and by these the philosophy was spread over Europe. Many academies were founded for the propagation of their dogmas and rules, so that the young might be instructed; and this system flourishes with the Germans, and other nations, right down to the present day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-iii:-what-was-taught-in-the-schools-of-the-egyptians.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER III: WHAT WAS TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE EGYPTIANS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-iii:-what-was-taught-in-the-schools-of-the-egyptians.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Chaldeans, Persians, and Egyptians had all of them the same knowledge of the secrets of Nature, and also the same religion. It was only the names that differed. The Chaldeans and Persians called their doctrine Sophia and Magic<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\">[27]</a></sup>; and the Egyptians, because of the sacrifice, called their wisdom priestcraft. The magic of the Persians, and the theology of the Egyptians, were both of them taught in the schools of old. Though there were many schools and learned men in Arabia, Africa, and Greece, such as Albumazar, Abenzagel, Geber, Rhasis, and Avicenna among the Arabians; and among the Greeks, Machaon, Podalirius, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Plato, Aristotle, and Rhodianus; still there were different opinions amongst them as to the wisdom of the Egyptian on points wherein they themselves differed, and whereupon they disagreed with it. For this reason Pythagoras could not be called a wise man, because the Egyptian priestcraft and wisdom were not perpectly taught, although he received therefrom many mysteries and arcana; and that Anaxagoras had received a great many as well, is clear from his discussions on the subject of Sol and its Stone, which he left behind him after his death. Yet he differed in many respects from the Egyptians. Even they would not be called wise men or Magi; but, following Pythagoras, they assumed the name of philosophy: yet they gathered no more than a few gleams like shadows from the magic of the Persians and the Egyptians. But Moses, Abraham, Solomon, Adam, and the wise men that came from the East to Christ, were true Magi, divine sophists and cabalists. Of this art and wisdom the Greeks knew very little or nothing at all; and therefore we shall leave this philosophical wisdom of the Greeks as being a mere speculation, utterly distinct and separate from other true arts and sciences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-iv:-what-magi-the-chaldeans-persians-and-egyptians-were.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER IV: WHAT MAGI THE CHALDEANS, PERSIANS, AND EGYPTIANS WERE. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-iv:-what-magi-the-chaldeans-persians-and-egyptians-were.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Many persons have endeavoured to investigate and make use of the secret magic of these wise men; but it has not yet been accomplished. Many even of our own age exalt Trithemius, others Bacon and Agrippa, for magic and the cabala<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\">[28]</a></sup>5 – two things apparently quite distinct – not knowing why they do so. Magic, indeed, is an art and faculty whereby the elementary bodies, their fruits, properties, virtues, and hidden operations are comprehended. But the cabala, by a subtle understanding of the Scriptures, seems to trace out the way to God for men, to shew them how they may act with Him, and prophesy from Him; for the cabala is full of divine mysteries, even as Magic is full of natural secrets. It teaches of and foretells from the nature of things to come as well as of things present, since its operation consists in knowing the inner constitution of all creatures, of celestial as well as terrestrial bodies: what is latent within them; what are their occult virtues; for what they were originally designed, and with what properties they are endowed. These and the like subjects are the bonds wherewith things celestial are bound up with things of the earth, as may sometimes be seen in their operation even with the bodily eyes. Such a conjunction of celestial influences, whereby the heavenly virtues acted upon inferior bodies, was formerly called by the Magi a Gamahea<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\">[29]</a></sup>, or the marriage of the celestial powers and properties with elementary bodies. Hence ensued the excellent commixtures of all bodies, celestial and terrestrial, namely, of the sun and planets, likewise vegetables, minerals, and animals.</p>\n<p>The devil attempted with his whole force and endeavour to darken this light; nor was he wholly frustrated in his hopes, for he deprived all Greece of it, and, in place thereof, introduced among that people human speculations and simple blasphemies against God and against His Son. Magic, it is true, had its origin in the Divine Ternary and arose from the Trinity of God. For God marked all His creatures with this Ternary and engraved its hieroglyph on them with His own finger. Nothing in the nature of things can be assigned or produced that lacks this magistery of the Divine Ternary, or that does not even ocularly prove it. The creature teaches us to understand and see the Creator Himself, as St. Paul testifies to the Romans. This covenant of the Divine Ternary, diffused throughout the whole substance of things, is indissoluble. By this, also, we have the secrets of all Nature from the four elements. For the Ternary, with the magical Quaternary, produces a perfect Septenary, endowed with many arcana and demonstrated by things which are known. When the Quaternary rests in the Ternary, then arises the Light of the World on the horizon of eternity, and by the assistance of God gives us the whole bond. Here also it refers to the virtues and operations of all creatures, and to their use, since they are stamped and marked with their arcana, signs, characters, and figures, so that there is left in them scarcely the smallest occult point which is not made clear on examination. Then when the Quaternary and the Ternary mount to the Denary is accomplished their retrogression or reduction to unity. Herein is comprised all the occult wisdom of things which God has made plainly manifest to men, both by His word and by the creatures of His hands, so that they may have a true knowledge of them. This shall be made more clear in another place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-v:-concerning-the-chief-and-supreme-essence-of-things.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER V: CONCERNING THE CHIEF AND SUPREME ESSENCE OF THINGS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-v:-concerning-the-chief-and-supreme-essence-of-things.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Magi in their wisdom asserted that all creatures might be brought to one unified substance, which substance they affirm may, by purifications and purgations, attain to so high a degree of subtlety, such divine nature and occult property, as to work wonderful results. For they considered that by returning to the earth, and by a supreme magical separation, a certain perfect substance would come forth, which is at length, by many industrious and prolonged preparations, exalted and raised up above the range of vegetable substances into mineral, above mineral into metallic, and above perfect metallic substances into a perpetual and divine Quintessence<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\">[30]</a></sup>, including in itself the essence of all celestial and terrestrial creatures. The Arabs and Greeks, by the occult characters and hieroglyphic descriptions of the Persians and the Egyptians, attained to secret and abstruse mysteries. When these were obtained and partially understood they saw with their own eyes, in the course of experimenting, many wonderful and strange effects. But since the supercelestial operations lay more deeply hidden than their capacity could penetrate, they did not call this a supercelestial arcanum according to the institution of the Magi, but the arcanum of the Philosophers’ Stone according to the counsel and judgment of Pythagoras. Whoever obtained this Stone overshadowed it with various enigmatical figures, deceptive resemblances, comparisons, and fictitious titles, so that its matter might remain occult. Very little or no knowledge of it therefore can be had from them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-vi:-concerning-the-different-errors-as-to-its-discovery-and-knowledge.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER VI: CONCERNING THE DIFFERENT ERRORS AS TO ITS DISCOVERY AND KNOWLEDGE. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-vi:-concerning-the-different-errors-as-to-its-discovery-and-knowledge.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The philosophers have prefixed most occult names to this matter of the Stone, grounded on mere similitudes. Arnold, observing this, says in his &quot;Rosary&quot; that the greatest difficulty is to find out the material of this Stone; for they have called it vegetable, animal, and mineral, but not according to the literal sense, which is well known to such wise men as have had experience of divine secrets and the miracles of this same Stone. For example, Raymond Lully’s &quot;Lunaria&quot; may be cited. This gives flowers of admirable virtues familiar to the philosophers themselves; but it was not the intention of those philosophers that you should think they meant thereby any projection upon metals, or that any such preparations should be made; but the abstruse mind of the philosophers had another intention. In like manner, they called their matter by the name of Martagon, to which they applied an occult alchemical operation; when, notwithstanding that name, it denotes nothing more than a hidden similitude. Moreover, no small error has arisen in the liquid of vegetables, with which a good many have sought to coagulate Mercury<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\">[31]</a></sup>, and afterwards to convert it with fixatory waters into Luna, since they supposed that he who in this way could coagulate it without the aid of metals would succeed in becoming the chief master. Now, although the liquids of some vegetables do effect this, yet the result is due merely to the resin, fat, and earthy sulphur with which they abound. This attracts to itself the moisture of the Mercury which rises with the substance in the process of coagulation, but without any advantage resulting. I am well assured that no thick and external Sulphur in vegetables is adapted for a perfect projection in Alchemy, as some have found out to their cost. Certain persons have, it is true, coagulated Mercury with the white and milky juice of tittinal, on account of the intense heat which exists therein; and they have called that liquid &quot;Lac Virginis&quot;; yet this is a false basis. The same may be asserted concerning the juice of celandine, although it colours just as though it were endowed with gold. Hence people conceived a vain idea. At a certain fixed time they rooted up this vegetable, from which they sought for a soul or quintessence, wherefrom they might make a coagulating and transmuting tincture. But hence arose nothing save a foolish error.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-vii:-concerning-the-errors-of-those-who-seek-the-stone-in-vegetables.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER VII: CONCERNING THE ERRORS OF THOSE WHO SEEK THE STONE IN VEGETABLES. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-vii:-concerning-the-errors-of-those-who-seek-the-stone-in-vegetables.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Some alchemists have pressed a juice out of celandine, boiled it to thickness, and put it in the sun, so that it might coagulate into a hard mass, which, being afterwards pounded into a fine black powder, should turn Mercury by projection into Sol. This they also found to be in vain. Others mixed Sal Ammoniac with this powder; others the Colcothar of Vitriol, supposing that they would thus arrive at their desired result. They brought it by their solutions into a yellow water, so that the Sal Ammoniac allowed an entrance of the tincture into the substance of the Mercury. Yet again nothing was accomplished. There are some again who, instead of the abovementioned substances, take the juices of persicaria, bufonaria, dracunculus, the leaves of willow, tithymal, cataputia, flammula, and the like, and shut them up in a glass vessel with Mercury for some days, keeping them in ashes. Thus it comes about that the Mercury is turned into ashes, but deceptively and without any result. These people were misled by the vain rumours of the vulgar, who give it out that he who is able to coagulate Mercury without metals has the entire Magistery, as we have said before. Many, too, have extracted salts, oils, and sulphurs artificially out of vegetables, but quite in vain. Out of such salts, oils, and sulphurs no coagulation of Mercury, or perfect projection, or tincture, can be made. But when the philosophers compare their matter to a certain golden tree of seven boughs, they mean that such matter includes all the seven metals in its sperm, and that in it these lie hidden. On this account they called their matter vegetable, because, as in the case of natural trees, they also in their time produce various flowers. So, too, the matter of the Stone shews most beautiful colours in the production of its flowers. The comparison, also, is apt, because a certain matter rises out of the philosophical earth, as if it were a thicket of branches and sprouts: like a sponge growing on the earth. They say, therefore, that the fruit of their tree tends towards heaven. So, then, they put forth that the whole thing hinged upon natural vegetables, though not as to its matter, because their stone contains within itself a body, soul, and spirit, as vegetables do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-viii:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-in-animals.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER VIII: CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT THE STONE IN ANIMALS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-viii:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-in-animals.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>They have also, by a name based only on resemblances, called this matter Lac Virginis, and the Blessed Blood of Rosy Colour, which, nevertheless, suits only the prophets and sons of God. Hence the sophists<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\">[32]</a></sup> gathered that this philosophical matter was in the blood of animals or of man. Sometimes, too, because they are nourished by vegetables, others have sought it in hairs, in salt of urine, in rebis; others in hens’ eggs, in milk, and in the calx of egg shells, with all of which they thought they would be able to fix Mercury. Some have extracted salt out of foetid urine, supposing that to be the matter of the Stone. Some persons, again, have considered the little stones found in rebis to be the matter. Others have macerated the membranes of eggs in a sharp lixivium, with which they also mixed calcined egg shells as white as snow. To these they have attributed the arcanum of fixation for the transmutation of Mercury. Others, comparing the white of the egg to silver and the yolk to gold, have chosen it for their matter, mixing with it common salt, sal ammoniac, and burnt tartar. These they shut up in a glass vessel, and puri6ed in a Balneum Maris until the white matter became as red as blood. This, again, they distilled into a most offensive liquid, utterly useless for the purpose they had in view. Others have purified the white and yolk of eggs; from which has been generated a basilisk. This they burnt to a deep red powder, and sought to tinge with it, as they learnt from the treatise of Cardinal Gilbert. Many, again, have macerated the galls of oxen, mixed with common salt, and distilled this into a liquid, with which they moistened the cementary powders, supposing that, by means of this Magistery, they would tinge their metals. This they called by the name of &quot;a part with a part&quot;, and thence came – just nothing. Others have attempted to transmute tutia by the addition of dragon’s blood and other substances, and also to change copper and electrum into gold. Others, according to the Venetian Art, as they call it, take twenty lizard-like animals, more or less, shut them up in a vessel, and make them mad with hunger, so that they may devour one another until only one of them survives. This one is then fed with filings of copper or of electrum. They suppose that this animal, simply by the digestion of his stomach, will bring about the desired transmutation. Finally, they burn this animal into a red powder, which they thought must be gold; but they were deceived. Others, again, having burned the fishes called truitas (? trouts), have sometimes, upon melting them, found some gold in them; but there is no other reason for it than this: Those fish sometimes in rivers and streams meet with certain small scales and sparks of gold, which they eat. It is seldom, however, that such deceivers are found, and then chiefly in the courts of princes. The matter of the philosophers is not to be sought in animals: this I announce to all. Still, it is evident that the philosophers called their Stone animal, because in their final operations the virtue of this most excellent fiery mystery caused an obscure liquid to exude drop by drop from the matter in their vessels. Hence they predicted that, in the last times, there should come a most pure man upon the earth, by whom the redemption of the world should be brought about; and that this man should send forth bloody drops of a red colour, by means of which he should redeem the world from sin. In the same way, after its own kind, the blood of their Stone freed the leprous metals from their infirmities and contagion. On these grounds, therefore, they supposed they were justified in saying that their Stone was animal. Concerning this mystery Mercurius speaks as follows to King Calid: –</p>\n<p>&quot;This mystery it is permitted only to the prophets of God to know. Hence it comes to pass that this Stone is called animal, because in its blood a soul lies hid. It is likewise composed of body, spirit, and soul. For the same reason they called it their microcosm, because it has the likeness of all things in the world, and thence they termed it animal, as Plato named the great world an animal&quot;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-ix:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-in-minerals.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER IX: CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT THE STONE IN MINERALS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-ix:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-in-minerals.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Hereto are added the many ignorant men who suppose the stone to be three-fold, and to be hidden in a triple genus, namely, vegetable, animal, and mineral. Hence it is that they have sought for it in minerals. Now, this is far from the opinion of the philosophers. They affirm that their stone is uniformly vegetable, animal, and mineral. Now, here note that Nature has distributed its mineral sperm into various kinds, as, for instance, into sulphurs, salts, boraxes, nitres, ammoniacs, alums, arsenics, atraments, vitriols, tutias, haematites, orpiments, realgars, magnesias, cinnabar, antimony, talc, cachymia, marcasites, etc. In all these Nature has not yet attained to our matter; although in some of the species named it displays itself in a wonderful aspect for the transmutation of imperfect metals that are to be brought to perfection. Truly, long experience and practice with fire shew many and various permutations in the matter of minerals, not only from one colour to another, but from one essence to another, and from imperfection to perfection. And, although Nature has, by means of prepared minerals, reached some perfection, yet philosophers will not have it that the matter of the philosophic stone proceeds out of any of the minerals, although they say that their stone is universal. Hence, then, the sophists take occasion to persecute Mercury himself with various torments, as with sublimations, coagulations, mercurial waters, aquafortis, and the like. All these erroneous ways should be avoided, together with other sophistical preparations of minerals, and the purgations and fixations of spirits and metals. Wherefore all the preparations of the stone, as of Geber, Albertus Magnus, and the rest, are sophistical. Their purgations, cementations, sublimations, distillations, rectifications, circulations, putrefactions, conjunctions, solutions, ascensions, coagulations, calcinations, and incinerations are utterly profitless, both in the tripod, in the athanor, in the reverberatory furnace, in the melting furnace, the accidioneum, in dung, ashes, sand, or what not; and also in the cucurbite, the pelican, retort, phial, fixatory, and the rest. The same opinion must be passed on the sublimation of Mercury by mineral spirits, for the white and the red, as by vitriol, saltpetre, alum, crocuses, etc., concerning all which subjects that sophist, John de Rupescissa, romances in his treatise on the White and Red Philosophic Stone. Taken altogether, these are merely deceitful dreams. Avoid also the particular sophistry of Geber; for example, his sevenfold sublimations or mortifications, and also the revivifications of Mercury, with his preparations of salts of urine, or salts made by a sepulchre, all which things are untrustworthy. Some others have endeavoured to fix Mercury with: the sulphurs of minerals and metals, but have been greatly deceived. It is true I have seen Mercury by this Art, and by such fixations, brought into a metallic body resembling and counterfeiting good silver in all respects; but when brought to the test it has shewn itself to be false.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-x:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-and-also-particulars-in-minerals.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER X: CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT THE STONE AND ALSO PARTICULARS IN MINERALS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-x:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-and-also-particulars-in-minerals.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Some sophists have tried to squeeze out a fixed oil from Mercury seven times sublimed and as often dissolved by means of aquafortis. In this way they attempt to bring imperfect metals to perfection: but they have been obliged to relinquish their vain endeavour. Some have purged vitriol seven times by calcination, solution, and coagulation, with the addition of two parts of sal ammoniac, and by sublimation, so that it might be resolved into a white water, to which they have added a third part of quicksilver, that it might be coagulated by water. Then afterwards they have sublimated the Mercury several times from the vitriol and sal ammoniac, so that it became a stone. This stone they affirmed, being conceived of the vitriol, to be the Red Sulphur of the philosophers, with which they have, by means of solutions and coagulations, made some progress in attaining the stone; but in projection it has all come to nothing. Others have coagulated Mercury by water of alum into a hard mass like alum itself; and this they have fruitlessly fixed with fixatory waters. The sophists propose to themselves very many ways of fixing Mercury, but to no purpose, for therein nothing perfect or constant can be had. It is therefore in vain to add minerals thereto by sophistical processes, since by all of them he is stirred up to greater malice, is rendered more lively, and rather brought to greater impurity than to any kind of perfection. So, then, the philosophers’ matter is not to be sought from thence. Mercury is somewhat imperfect; and to bring it to perfection will be very difficult, nay, impossible for any sophist. There is nothing therein that can be stirred up or compelled to perfection. Some have taken arsenic several times sublimated, and frequently dissolved with oil of tartar and coagulated. This they have pretended to fix, and by it to turn copper into silver. This, however, is merely a sophistical whitening, for arsenic cannot be fixed<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\">[33]</a></sup> unless the operator be an Artist, and knows well its tingeing spirit. Truly in this respect all the philosophers have slept, vainly attempting to accomplish anything thereby. Whoever, therefore, is ignorant as to this spirit, cannot have any hopes of fixing it, or of giving it that power which would make it capable of the virtue of transmutation. So, then, I give notice to all that the whitening of which I have just now spoken is grounded on a false basis, and that by it the copper is deceitfully whitened, but not changed.</p>\n<p>Now the sophists have mixed this counterfeit Venus with twice its weight of Luna, and sold it to the goldsmiths and mint-masters, until at last they have transmuted themselves into false coiners – not only those who sold, but those who bought it. Some sophists instead of white arsenic take red, and this has turned out false art; because, however it is prepared, it proves to be nothing but whiteness.</p>\n<p>Some, again, have gone further and dealt with common sulphur, which, being so yellow, they have boiled in vinegar, lixivium, or sharpest wines, for a day and a night, until it became white. Then afterwards they sublimated it from common salt and the calx of eggs, repeating the process several times; yet, still, though white, it has been always combustible. Nevertheless, with this they have endeavoured to fix Mercury and to turn it into gold; but in vain. From this, however, comes the most excellent and beautiful cinnabar that I have ever seen. This they propose to fix with the oil of sulphur by cementation and fixation. It does, indeed, give something of an appearance, but still falls short of the desired object. Others have reduced common sulphur to the form of a hepar, boiling it in vinegar with the addition of linseed oil, or laterine oil, or olive oil. They then pour it into a marble mortar, and make it into the form of a hepar, which they have first distilled into a citrine oil with a gentle fire. But they have found to their loss that they could not do anything in the way of transmuting Luna to Sol as they supposed they would be able. As there is an infinite number of metals, so also there is much variety in the preparation of them: I shall not make further mention of these in this place, because each a mould require a special treatise. Beware also of sophisticated oils of vitriol and antimony. Likewise be on your guard against the oils of the metals, perfect or imperfect, as Sol or Luna; because although the operation of these is most potent in the nature of things, yet the true process is known, even at this day, to very few persons. Abstain also from the sophistical preparations of common mercury, arsenic, sulphur, and the like, by sublimation, descension, fixation by vinegar, saltpetre, tartar, vitriol, sal ammoniac, according to the formulas prescribed in the books of the sophists. Likewise avoid the sophisticated tinctures taken from marcasites and crocus of Mars, and also of that sophistication called by the name of &quot;a part with a part&quot;, and of fixed Luna and similar trifles. Although they have some superficial appearance of truth, as the fixation of Luna by little labour and industry, still the progress of the preparation is worthless and weak. Being therefore moved with compassion towards the well meaning operators in this art, I have determined to lay open the whole foundation of philosophy in three separate arcana, namely, in one explained by arsenic, in a second by vitriol, and in a third by antimony; by means of which I will teach the true projection upon Mercury and upon the imperfect metals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xi:-concerning-the-true-and-perfect-special-arcanum-of-arsenic-for-the-white-tincture.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XI: CONCERNING THE TRUE AND PERFECT SPECIAL ARCANUM OF ARSENIC FOR THE WHITE TINCTURE. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xi:-concerning-the-true-and-perfect-special-arcanum-of-arsenic-for-the-white-tincture.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Some persons have written that arsenic is compounded of Mercury and, Sulphur, others of earth and water; but most writers say that it is of the nature of Sulphur. But, however that may be, its nature is such that it transmutes red copper into white. It may also be brought to such a perfect state of preparation as to be able to tinge. But this is not done in the way pointed out by such evil sophists as Geber in &quot;The Sum of Perfection&quot;, Albertus Magnus, Aristotle the chemist in &quot;The Book of the Perfect Magistery&quot;, Rhasis and Polydorus; for those writers, however many they be, are either themselves in error, or else they write falsely out of sheer envy, and put forth receipts whilst not ignorant of the truth. Arsenic contains within itself three natural spirits. The first is volatile, combustible, corrosive, and penetrating all metals. This spirit whitens Venus and after some days renders it spongy. But this artifice relates only to those who practise the caustic art. The second spirit is crystalline and sweet. The third is a tingeing spirit separated from the others before mentioned. True philosophers seek for these three natural properties in arsenic with a view to the perfect projection of the wise men<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\">[34]</a></sup>. But those barbers who practise surgery seek after that sweet and crystalline nature separated from the tingeing spirit for use in the cure of wounds, buboes, carbuncles, anthrax, and other similar ulcers which are not curable save by gentle means. As for that tingeing spirit, however, unless the pure be separated from the impure in it, the fixed from the volatile, and the secret tincture from the combustible, it will not in any way succeed according to your wish for projection on Mercury, Venus, or any other imperfect metal. All philosophers have hidden this arcanum as a most excellent mystery. This tingeing spirit, separated from the other two as above, you must join to the spirit of Luna, and digest them together for the space of thirty-two days, or until they have assumed a new body. After it has, on the fortieth natural day, been kindled into flame by the heat of the sun, the spirit appears in a bright whiteness, and is endued with a perfect tingeing arcanum. Then it is at length fit for projection, namely, one part of it upon sixteen parts of an imperfect body, according to the sharpness of the preparation. From thence appears shining and most excellent Luna, as though it had been dug from the bowels of the earth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xii:-general-instruction-concerning-the-arcanum-of-vitriol-and-the-red-tincture-to-be-extracted-from-it.36\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XII: GENERAL INSTRUCTION CONCERNING THE ARCANUM OF VITRIOL AND THE RED TINCTURE TO BE EXTRACTED FROM IT.[^36] <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xii:-general-instruction-concerning-the-arcanum-of-vitriol-and-the-red-tincture-to-be-extracted-from-it.36\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Vitriol is a very noble mineral among the rest, and was held always in highest estimation by philosophers, because the Most High God has adorned it with wonderful gifts. They have veiled its arcanum in enigmatical figures like the following: &quot;Thou shalt go to the inner parts of the earth, and by rectification thou shalt find the occult stone, a true medicine&quot;. By the earth they understood the Vitriol itself; and by the inner parts of the earth its sweetness and redness, because in the occult part of the Vitriol lies hid a subtle, noble, and most fragrant juice, and a pure oil. The method of its production is not to be approached by calcination or by distillation. For it must not be deprived on any account of its green colour. If it were, it would at the same time lose its arcanum and its power. Indeed, it should be observed at this point that minerals, and also vegetables and other like things which shew greenness without, contain within themselves an oil red like blood, which is their arcanum. Hence it is clear that the distillations of the druggists are useless, vain, foolish, and of no value, because these people do not know how to extract the bloodlike redness from vegetables. Nature herself is wise, and turns all the waters of vegetables to a lemon colour, and after that into an oil which is very red like blood. The reason why this is so slowly accomplished arises from the too great haste of the ignorant operators who distil it, which causes the greenness to be consumed. They have not learnt to strengthen Nature with their own powers, which is the mode whereby that noble green colour ought to be rectified into redness of itself. An example of this is white wine digesting itself into a lemon colour; and in process of time the green colour of the grape is of itself turned into the red which underlies the coerulean. The greenness therefore of the vegetables and minerals being lost by the incapacity of the operators, the essence also and spirit of the oil and of the balsam, which is noblest among arcana, will also perish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xiii:-special-instruction-concerning-the-process-of-vitriol-for-the-red-tincture.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XIII: SPECIAL INSTRUCTION CONCERNING THE PROCESS OF VITRIOL FOR THE RED TINCTURE. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xiii:-special-instruction-concerning-the-process-of-vitriol-for-the-red-tincture.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Vitriol contains within itself many muddy and viscous imperfections. Therefore its greenness[^37] must be often extracted with water, and rectified until it puts off all the impurities of earth. When all these rectifications are finished, take care above all that the matter shall not be exposed to the sun, for this turns its greenness pale, and at the same time absorbs the arcanum. Let it be kept covered up in a warm stove so that no dust may defile it. Afterwards let it be digested in a closed glass vessel for the space of several months, or until different colours and deep redness shew themselves. Still you must not suppose that by this process the redness is sufficiently fixed. It must, in addition, be cleansed from the interior and accidental defilements of the earth, in the following manner: – It must be rectified with acetum until the earthy defilement is altogether removed, and the dregs are taken away. This is now the true and best rectification of its tincture, from which the blessed oil is to be extracted. From this tincture, which is carefully enclosed in a glass vessel, an alembic afterwards placed on it and luted so that no spirit may escape, the spirit of this oil must be extracted by distillation over a mild and slow fire. This oil is much pleasanter and sweeter than any aromatic balsam of the drugsellers, being entirely free from all acridity[^38]. There will subside in tha bottom of the cucurbite some very white earth, shining and glittering like snow. This keep, and protect from all dust. This same earth is altogether separated from its redness.</p>\n<p>Thereupon follows the greatest arcanum, that is to say, the Supercelestial Marriage of the Soul, consummately prepared and washed by the blood of the lamb, with its own splendid, shining, and purified body. This is the true supercelestial marriage by which life is prolonged to the last and predestined day. In this way, then, the soul and spirit of the Vitriol, which are its blood, are joined with its purified body, that they may be for eternity inseparable. Take, therefore, this our foliated earth in a glass phial. Into it pour gradually its own oil. The body will receive and embrace its soul; since the body is affected with extreme desire for the soul, and the soul is most perfectly delighted with the embrace of the body. Place this conjunction in a furnace of arcana, and keep it there for forty days. When these have expired you will have a most absolute oil of wondrous perfection, in which Mercury and any other of the imperfect metals are turned into gold.</p>\n<p>Now let us turn our attention to its multiplication. Take the corporal Mercury, in the proportion of two parts; pour it over three parts, equal in weight, of the aforesaid oil, and let them remain together for forty days. By this proportion of weight and this order the multiplication becomes infinite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xiv:-concerning-the-secrets-and-arcana-of-antimony-for-the-red-tincture-with-a-view-to-transmutation.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XIV: CONCERNING THE SECRETS AND ARCANA OF ANTIMONY, FOR THE RED TINCTURE, WITH A VIEW TO TRANSMUTATION. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xiv:-concerning-the-secrets-and-arcana-of-antimony-for-the-red-tincture-with-a-view-to-transmutation.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Antimony is the true bath of gold. Philosophers call it the examiner and the stilanx. Poets say that in this bath Vulcan washed Phoebus, and purified him from all dirt and imperfection. It is produced from the purest and noblest Mercury and Sulphur, under the genus of vitriol, in metallic form and brightness. Some philosophers call it the White Lead of the Wise Men, or simply the Lead. Take, therefore, of Antimony, the very best of its kind, as much as you will. Dissolve this in its own aquafortis, and throw it into cold water, adding a little of the crocus of Mars, so that it may sink to the bottom of the vessel as a sediment, for otherwise it does not throw off its dregs. After it has been dissolved in this way it will have acquired supreme beauty. Let it be placed in a glass vessel, closely fastened on all sides with a very thick lute, or else in a stone bocia, and mix with it some calcined tutia, sublimated to the perfect degree of fire. It must be carefully guarded from liquefying, because with too great heat it breaks the glass. From one pound of this Antimony a sublimation is made, perfected for a space of two days. Place this sublimated substance in a phial that it may touch the water with its third part, in a luted vessel, so that the spirit may not escape. Let it be suspended over the tripod of arcana, and let the work be urged on at first with a slow fire equal to the sun’s heat at midsummer. Then at length on the tenth day let it be gradually increased. For with too great heat the glass vessels are broken, and sometimes even the furnace goes to pieces. While the vapour is ascending different colours appear. Let the fire be moderated until a red matter is seen. Afterwards dissolve in very sharp Acetum, and throw away the dregs. Let the Acetum be abstracted and let it be again dissolved in common distilled water. This again must be abstracted, and the sediment distilled with a very strong fire in a glass vessel closely shut. The whole body of the Antimony will ascend as a very red oil, like the colour of a ruby, and will flow into the receiver, drop by drop, with a most fragrant smell and a very sweet taste[^39]. This is the supreme arcanum of the philosophers in Antimony, which they account most highly among the arcana of oils. Then, lastly, let the oil of Sol be made in the following way: – Take of the purest Sol as much as you will, and dissolve it in rectified spirit of wine. Let the spirit be abstracted several times, and an equal number of times let it be dissolved again. Let the last solution be kept with the spirit of wine, and circulated for a month. Afterwards let the volatile gold and the spirit of wine be distilled three or four times by means of an alembic, so that it may flow down into the receiver and be brought to its supreme essence. To half an ounce of this dissolved gold let one ounce of the Oil of Antimony be added. This oil embraces it in the heat of the bath, so that it does not easily let it go, even if the spirit of wine be extracted. In this way you will have the supreme mystery and arcanum of Nature, to which scarcely any equal can be assigned in the nature of things. Let these two oils in combination be shut up together in a phial after the manner described, hung on a tripod for a philosophical month, and warmed with a very gentle fire; although, if the fire be regulated in dire proportion this operation is concluded in thirty-one days, and brought to perfection. By this, Mercury and any other imperfect metals acquire the perfection of gold.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xv:-concerning-the-projection-to-be-made-by-the-mystery-and-arcanum-of-antimony.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XV: CONCERNING THE PROJECTION TO BE MADE BY THE MYSTERY AND ARCANUM OF ANTIMONY. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xv:-concerning-the-projection-to-be-made-by-the-mystery-and-arcanum-of-antimony.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>No precise weight can be assigned in this work of projection, though the tincture itself may be extracted from a certain subject, in a defined proportion, and with fitting appliances. For instance, that Medicine tinges sometimes thirty, forty, occasionally even sixty, eighty, or a hundred parts of the imperfect metal. So, then, the whole business hinges chiefly on the purification of the Medicine and the industry of the operator, and, next, on the greater; or lesser cleanliness and purity of the imperfect body taken in hand. For instance, one Venus is more pure than another; and hence it happens that no one fixed weight can be specified in projection. This alone is worth noting, that if the operator happens to have taken too much of the tincture, he can correct this mistake by adding more of the imperfect metal. But if there be too much of the subject, so that the powers of the tincture are weakened, this error is easily remedied by a cineritium, or by cementations, or by ablutions in crude Antimony. There is nothing at this stage which need delay the operator; only let him put before himself a fact which has been passed over by the philosophers, and by some studiously veiled, namely, that in projections there must be a revivification, that is to say, an animation of imperfect bodies – nay, so to speak, a spiritualisation; concerning which some have said that their metals are no common ones, since they live and have a soul.</p>\n<h2 id=\"animation-is-produced-in-the-following-way.\" tabindex=\"-1\">ANIMATION IS PRODUCED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#animation-is-produced-in-the-following-way.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Take of Venus, wrought into small plates, as much as you will, ten, twenty, or forty pounds. Let these be incrusted with a pulse made of arsenic and calcined tartar, and calcined in their own vessel for twenty-four hours. Then at length let the Venus be pulverised, washed, and thoroughly purified. Let the calcination with ablution be repeated three or four times. In this way it is purged and purified from its thick greenness and from its own impure sulphur. You will have to be on your guard against calcinations made with common sulphur. For whatever is good in the metal is spoilt thereby, and what is bad becomes worse. To ten marks of this purged Venus add one of pure Luna. But in order that the work of the Medicine may be accelerated by projection, and may more easily penetrate the imperfect body, and drive out all portions which are opposed to the nature of Luna, this is accomplished by means of a perfect ferment. For the work is defiled by means of an impure Sulphur, so that a cloud is stretched out over the surface of the transmuted substance, or the metal is mixed with the loppings of the Sulphur and may be cast away therewith. But if a projection of a red stone is to be made, with a view to a red transmutation, it must first fall on gold, afterwards on silver, or on some other metal thoroughly purified, as we have directed above. From thence arises the most perfect gold.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xvi:-concerning-the-universal-matter-of-the-philosophers'-stone.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XVI: CONCERNING THE UNIVERSAL MATTER OF THE PHILOSOPHERS’ STONE. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xvi:-concerning-the-universal-matter-of-the-philosophers'-stone.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After the mortification of vegetables, they are transmuted, by the concurrence of two minerals, such as Sulphur and Salt, into a mineral nature, so that at length they themselves become perfect minerals. So it is that in the mineral burrows and caves of the earth, vegetables are found which, in the long succession of time, and by the continuous heat of sulphur, put off the vegetable nature and assume that of the mineral. This happens, for the most part, where the appropriate nutriment is taken away from vegetables of this kind, so that they are afterwards compelled to derive their nourishment from the sulphur and salts of the earth, until what was before vegetable passes over into a perfect mineral. From this mineral state, too, sometimes a perfect metallic essence arises, and this happens by the progress of one degree into another.</p>\n<p>But let us return to the Philosophers’ Stone. The matter of this, as certain writers have mentioned, is above all else difficult to discover and abstruse to understand. The method and most certain rule for finding out this, as well as other subjects – what they embrace or are able to effect – is a careful examination of the root and seed by which they come to our knowledge. For this, before all things else, a consideration of principles is absolutely necessary; and also of the manner in which Nature proceeds from imperfection to the end of perfection. Now, for this consideration it is well to have it thoroughly understood from the first that all things created by Nature consist of three primal elements, namely, natural Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt in combination, so that in some substances they are volatile, in others fixed. Wherever corporal Salt is mixed with spiritual Mercury and animated Sulphur into one body, then Nature begins to work, in those subterranean places which serve for her vessels, by means of a separating fire. By this the thick and impure Sulphur is separated from the pure, the earth is segregated from the Salt, and the clouds from the Mercury, while those purer parts are preserved, which Nature again welds together into a pure geogamic body. This operation is esteemed by the Magi as a mixture and conjunction by the uniting of three constituents, body, soul, and spirit. When this union is completed there results from it a pure Mercury. Now if this, when flowing down through its subterranean passages and veins, meets with a chaotic Sulphur, the Mercury is coagulated by it according to the condition of the Sulphur. It is, however, still volatile, so that scarcely in a hundred years is it transformed into a metal. Hence arose the vulgar idea that Mercury and Sulphur are the matter of the metals, as is certainly reported by miners. It is not, however, common Mercury and common Sulphur which are the matter of the metals, but the Mercury and the Sulphur of the philosophers are incorporated and inborn in perfect metals, and in the forms of them, so that they never fly from the fire, nor are they depraved by the force of the corruption caused by the elements. It is true that by the dissolution of this natural mixture our Mercury is subdued, as all the philosophers say. Under this form of words our Mercury comes to be drawn from perfect bodies and from the forces of the earthly planets. This is what Hermes asserts in the following terms: &quot;The Sun and the Moon are the roots of this Art&quot;. The Son of Hamuel says that the Stone of the philosophers is water coagulated, namely, in Sol and Luna. From this it is clearer than the sun that the material of the Stone is nothing else but Sol and Luna. This is confirmed by the fact that like produces like. We know that there are only two Stones, the white and the red. There are also two matters of the Stone, Sol and Luna, formed together in a proper marriage, both natural and artificial. Now, as we see that the man or the woman, without the seed of both, cannot generate, in the same way our man, Sol, and his wife, Luna, cannot conceive or do an thing in the way of generation, without the seed and sperm of both. Hence the philosophers gathered that a third thing was necessary, namely, the animated seed of both, the man and the woman, without which they judged that the whole of their work was fruitless and in vain. Such a sperm is Mercury, which, by the natural conjunction of both bodies Sol and Luna, receives their nature into itself in union. Then at length, and not before, the work is fit for congress, ingress, and generation; by the masculine and feminine power and virtue. Hence the philosophers have said that this same Mercury is composed of body, spirit, and soul, and that it has assumed the nature and property of all elements. Therefore, with their most powerful genius and intellect, they asserted their Stone to be animal. They even called it their Adam, who carries his own invisible Eve hidden in his body, from that moment in which they were united by the power of the Supreme God, the Maker of all creatures. For this reason it may be said that the Mercury of the Philosophers is none other than their most abstruse, compounded Mercury, and not the common Mercury. So then they have wisely said to the sages that there is in Mercury whatever wise men seek. Almadir, the philosopher, says: &quot;We extract our Mercury from one perfect body and two perfect natural conditions incorporated together, which indeed puts forth externally its perfection, whereby it is able to resist the fire, so that its internal imperfection may be protected by the external perfections&quot;. By this passage of the sagacious philosopher is understood the Adamic matter, the limbus of the microcosm[^40], and the homogeneous, unique matter of the philosophers. The sayings of these men, which we have before mentioned, are simply golden, and ever to be held in the highest esteem, because they contain nothing superfluous or without force. Summarily, then, the matter of the Philosophers’ Stone is none other than a fiery and perfect Mercury extracted by Nature and Art; that is, the artificially prepared and true hermaphrodite Adam, and the microcosm: That wisest of the philosophers, Mercurius, making the same statement, called the Stone an orphan. Our Mercury, therefore, is the same which contains in itself all the perfections, force, and virtues of the Sun, which also runs through all the streets and houses of all the planets, and in its own rebirth has acquired the force of things above and things below; to the marriage of which it is to be compared, as is clear from the whiteness and the redness combined in it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xvii:-concernlng-the-preparation-of-the-matter-for-the-philosophic-stone.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XVII: CONCERNlNG THE PREPARATION OF THE MATTER FOR THE PHILOSOPHIC STONE. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xvii:-concernlng-the-preparation-of-the-matter-for-the-philosophic-stone.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What Nature principally requires is that its own philosophic man should be brought into a mercurial substance, so that it may be born into the philosophic Stone. Moreover, it should be remarked that those common preparations of Geber, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Rupescissa, Polydorus, and such men, are nothing more than some particular solutions, sublimations, and calcinations, having no reference to our universal substance, which needs only the most secret fire of the philosophers. Let the fire and Azoth therefore suffice for you. From the fact that the philosophers make mention of certain preparations, such as putrefaction, distillation, sublimation, calcination, coagulation, dealbation, rubification, ceration, fixation, and the like, you should understand that in their universal substance, Nature herself fulfils all the operations in the matter spoken of, and not the operator, only in a philosophical vessel, and with a similar fire, but not common fire. The white and the red spring from one root without any intermediary. It is dissolved by itself, it copulates by itself, grows white, grows red, is made crocus-coloured and black by itself, marries itself and conceives in itself. It is therefore to be decocted, to be baked, to be fused; it ascends, and it descends. All these operations are a single operation and produced by the fire alone. Still, some philosophers, nevertheless, have, by a highly graduated essence of wine, dissolved the body of Sol, and rendered it volatile, so that it should ascend through an alembic, thinking that this is the true volatile matter of the philosophers, though it is not so. And although it be no contemptible arcanum to reduce this perfect metallic body into a volatile, spiritual substance, yet they are wrong in their separation of the elements. This process of the monks, such as Lully, Richard of England, Rupescissa, and the rest, is erroneous. By this process they thought that they were going to separate gold after this fashion into a subtle, spiritual, and elementary power, each by itself, and afterwards by circulation and rectification to combine them again in one – but in vain. For although one element may, in a certain sense, be separated from another, yet, nevertheless, every element separated in this way can again be separated into another element, but these elements cannot afterwards by circulation in a pelican, or by distillation, be again brought back into one; but they always remain a certain volatile matter, and aurum potabile, as they themselves call it. The reason why they could not compass their intention is that Nature refuses to be in this way dragged asunder and separated by man’s disjunctions, as by earthly glasses and instruments. She alone knows her own operations and the weights of the elements, the separations, rectifications, and copulations of which she brings about without the aid of any operator or manual artifice, provided only the matter be contained in the secret fire and in its proper occult vessel. The separation of the elements, therefore, is impossible by man. It may appear to take place, but it is not true, whatever may be said by Raymond Lully, and of that famous English golden work which he is falsely supposed to have accomplished. Nature herself has within herself the proper separator, who again joins together what he has put asunder, without the aid of man. She knows best the proportion of every element, which man does not know, however miseading writers romance in their frivolous and false recipes about this volatile gold.</p>\n<p>This is the opinion of the philosophers, that when they have put their matter into the more secret fire, and when with a moderated philosophical heat it is cherished on every side, beginning to pass into corruption, it grows black. This operation they term putrefaction, and they call the blackness by the name of the Crow’s Head. The ascent and descent thereof they term distillation, ascension, and descension. The exsiccation they call coagulation; and the dealbation they call calcination; while because it becomes fluid and soft in the heat they make mention of ceration. When it ceases to ascend and remains liquid at the bottom, they say fixation is present.</p>\n<p>In this manner it is the terms of philosophical operations are to bc understood, and not otherwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xviii:-concerning-instruments-and-the-philosophic-vessel.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XVIII: CONCERNING INSTRUMENTS AND THE PHILOSOPHIC VESSEL. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xviii:-concerning-instruments-and-the-philosophic-vessel.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Sham philosophers have misunderstood the occult and secret philosophic vessel, and worse is that which is said by Aristoteles the Alchemist (not the famous Greek Academic Philosopher), giving it out that the matter is to be decocted in a triple vessel. Worst of all is that which is said by another, namely, that the matter in its first separation and first degree requires a metallic vessel; in its second degree of coagulation and dealbation of its earth a glass vessel; and in the third degree, for fixation, an earthen vessel. Nevertheless, hereby the philosophers understand one vessel alone in all the operations up to the perfection of the red stone. Since, then, our matter is our root for the white and the red, necessarily our vessel must be so fashioned that the matter in it may be governed by the heavenly bodies. For invisible celestial influences and the impressions of the stars are in the very first degree necessary for the work: Otherwise it would be impossible for the Oriental, Chaldean, and Egyptian stone to be realised. By this Anaxagoras knew the powers of the whole firmament, and foretold that a great stone would descend from heaven to earth, which actually happened after his death. To the Cabalists our vessel is perfectly well known, because it must be made according to a truly geometrical proportion and measure, and from a definite quadrature of the circle, so that the spirit and the soul of our matter, separated from their body, may be able to raise this vessel with themselves in proportion to the altitude of heaven. If the vessel be wider, narrower, higher, or lower than is fitting, and than the dominating operating spirit and soul desire, the heat of our secret philosophic fire (which is, indeed, very severe), will violently excite the matter and urge it on to excessive operation, so that the vessel is shivered into a thousand pieces, with imminent danger to the body and even the life of the operator. On the other hand, if it be of greater capacity than is required in due proportion for the heat to have effect on the matter, the work will be wasted and thrown away. So, then, our philosophic vessel must be made with the greatest care. What the material of the vessel should be is understood only by those who, in the first solution of our fixed and perfected matter have brought that matter to its own primal quintessence. Enough has been said on this point.</p>\n<p>The operator must also very accurately note what, in its first solution, the matter sends forth and rejects from itself.</p>\n<p>The method of describing the form of the vessel is difficult. It should be such as Nature requires, and it must be sought out and investigated from every possible source, so that, from the height of the philosophic heaven, elevated above the philosophic earth, it may be able to operate on the fruit of its own earthly body. It should have this form, too, in order that the separation and purification of the elements, when the fire drives one from the other, may be able to be accomplished, and that each may have power to occupy the place to which it adheres; and also that the sun and the other planets may exercise their operations around the elemental earth, while their course in their circuit is neither hindered nor agitated with too swift a motion. In all these particulars which have been mentioned it must have a proper proportion of rotundity and of height.</p>\n<p>The instruments for the first purification of mineral bodies are fusing-vessels, bellows, tongs, capels, cupels, tests, cementatory vessels, cineritiums, cucurbites, bocias for aquafortis and aqua regia; and also the appliances which are required for projection at the climax of the work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xix:-concerning-the-secret-fire-of-the-philosophers.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XIX: CONCERNING THE SECRET FIRE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xix:-concerning-the-secret-fire-of-the-philosophers.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is a well-known sententious saying of the philosophers, &quot;Let fire and Azoc suffice thee&quot;. Fire alone is the whole work and the entire art. Moreover, they who build their fire and keep their vessel in that heat are in error. In vain some have attempted it with the heat of horse dung. By the coal fire, without a medium, they have sublimated their matter, but they have not dissolved it. Others have got their heat from lamps, asserting that this is the secret fire of the philosophers for making their Stone. Some have placed it in a bath, first of all in heaps of ants’ eggs; others in juniper ashes. Some have sought the fire in quicklime, in tartar, vitriol, nitre, etc. Others, again, have sought it in boiling water. Thomas Aquinas speaks falsely of this fire, saying that God and the angels cannot do without this fire, but use it daily. What blasphemy is this! Is it not a manifest lie that God is not able to do without the elemental heat of boiling water? All the heats excited by those means which have been mentioned are utterly useless for our work Take care not to be misled by Arnold de Villa Nova, who has written on the subject of the coal fire, for in this matter he will deceive you.</p>\n<p>Almadir says that the invisible rays of our fire of themselves suffice. Another cites, as an illustration, that the heavenly heat by its reflections tends to the coagulation and perfection of Mercury, just as by its continual motion it tends to the generation of metals. Again, says this same authority, &quot;Make a fire, vaporous, digesting, as for cooking, continuous, but not volatile or boiling, enclosed, shut off from the air, not burning, but altering and penetrating. Now, in truth, I have mentioned every mode of fire and of exciting heat. If you are a true philosopher you will understand&quot;. This is what he says.</p>\n<p>Salmanazar remarks: &quot;Ours is a corrosive fire, which brings over our vessel an air like a cloud, in which cloud the rays of this fire are hidden. If this dew of chaos and this moisture of the cloud fail, a mistake has been committed&quot;. Again, Almadir says, that unless the fire has warmed our sun with its moisture, by the excrement of the mountain, with a moderate ascent, we shall not be partakers either of the Red or the White Stone.</p>\n<p>All these matters shew quite openly to us the occult fire of the wise men. Finally, this is the matter of our fire, namely, that it be kindled by the quiet spirit of sensible fire, which drives upwards, as it were, the heated chaos from the opposite quarter, and above our philosophic matter. This heat, glowing above our vessel, must urge it to the motion of a perfect generation, temperately but continuously, without intermission.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-xx:-concerning-the-ferment-of-the-philosophers-and-the-weight.\" tabindex=\"-1\">CHAPTER XX: CONCERNING THE FERMENT OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, AND THE WEIGHT. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xx:-concerning-the-ferment-of-the-philosophers-and-the-weight.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Philosophers have laboured greatly in the art of ferments and of fermentations, which seems important above all others. With reference thereto some have made a vow to God and to the philosophers that they would never divulge its arcanum by similitudes or by parables.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Hermes, the father of all philosophers, in the &quot;Book of the Seven Treatises&quot;, most clearly discloses the secret of ferments, saying that they consist only of their own paste; and more at length he says that the ferment whitens the confection, hinders combustion, altogether retards the flux of the tincture, consoles bodies, and amplifies unions. He says, also, that this is the key and the end of the work, concluding that the ferment is nothing but paste, as that of the sun is nothing but sun, and that of the moon nothing but moon. Others affirm that the ferment is the soul, and if this be not rightly prepared from the magistery, it effects nothing. Some zealots of this Art seek the Art in common sulphur, arsenic, tutia, auripigment, vitriol, etc., but in vain; since the substance which is sought is the same as that from which it has to be drawn forth. It should be remarked, therefore, that fermentations of this kind do not succeed according to the wishes of the zealots in the way they desire, but, as is clear from what has been said above, simply in the way of natural successes.</p>\n<p>But, to come at length to the weight; this must be noted in two ways. The first is natural, the second artificial. The natural attains its result in the earth by Nature and concordance. Of this, Arnold says: If more or less earth than Nature requires be added, the soul is suffocated, and no result is perceived, nor any fixation. It is the same with the water. If more or less of this bc taken it will bring a corresponding loss. A superfluity renders the matter unduly moist, and a deficiency makes it too dry and too hard. If there be over much air present, it is too strongly impressed on the tincture; if there be too little, the body will turn out pallid. In the same way, if the fire be too strong, the matter is burnt up; if it be too slack, it has not the power of drying, nor of dissolving or heating the other elements. In these things elemental heat consists.</p>\n<p>Artificial weight is quite occult. It is comprised in the magical art of ponderations. Between the spirit, soul, and body, say the philosophers, weight consists of Sulphur as the director of the work; for the soul strongly desires Sulphur, and necessarily observes it by reason of its weight.</p>\n<p>You can understand it thus: Our matter is united to a red fixed Sulphur, to which a third part of the regimen has been entrusted, even to the ultimate degree, so that it may perfect to infinity the operation of the Stone, may remain therewith together with its fire, and may consist of a weight equal to the matter itself, in and through all, without variation of any degree. Therefore, after the matter has been adapted and mixed in its proportionate weight, it should be closely shut up with its seal in the vessel of the philosophers, and committed to the secret fire. In this the Philosophic Sun will rise and surge up, and will illuminate all things that have been looking for his light, expecting it with highest hope.</p>\n<p>In these few words we will conclude the arcanum of the Stone, an arcanum which is in no way maimed or defective, for which we give God undying thanks. Now have we opened to you our treasure, which is not to be paid for by the riches of the whole world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"alchemical-catechism\" tabindex=\"-1\">Alchemical Catechism <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#alchemical-catechism\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<p>Q. What is the chief study of a Philosopher?<br />\nA. It is the investigation of the operations of Nature.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the end of Nature?<br />\nA. God, Who is also its beginning.</p>\n<p>Q. Whence are all things derived?<br />\nA. From one and indivisible Nature.</p>\n<p>Q. Into how many regions is Nature separated?<br />\nA. Into four palmary regions.</p>\n<p>Q. Which are they?<br />\nA. The dry, the moist, the warm, and the cold, which are the four elementary qualities, whence all things originate.</p>\n<p>Q. How is Nature differentiated?<br />\nA. Into male and female.</p>\n<p>Q. To what may we compare Nature?<br />\nA. To Mercury.</p>\n<p>Q. Give a concise definition of Nature.<br />\nA. It is not visible, though it operates visibly; for it is simply a volatile spirit, fulfilling its office in bodies, and animated by the universal spirit-the divine breath, the central and universal fire, which vivifies all things that exist.</p>\n<p>Q. What should be the qualities possessed by the examiners of Nature?<br />\nA. They should be like unto Nature herself. That is to say, they should be truthful, simple, patient, and persevering.</p>\n<p>Q. What matters should subsequently engross their attention?<br />\nA. The philosophers should most carefully ascertain whether their designs are in harmony with Nature, and of a possible and attainable kind; if they would accomplish by their own power anything that is usually performed by the power of Nature, they must imitate her in every detail.</p>\n<p>Q. What method must be followed in order to produce something which shall be developed to a superior degree than Nature herself develops it.<br />\nA. The manner of its improvement must be studied, and this is invariably operated by means of a like nature. For example, if it be desired to develop the intrinsic virtue of a given metal beyond its natural condition, the chemist must avail himself of the metallic nature itself, and must be able to discriminate between its male and female differentiations.</p>\n<p>Q. Where does the metallic nature store her seeds?<br />\nA. In the four elements.</p>\n<p>Q. With what materials can the philosopher alone accomplish anything?<br />\nA. With the germ of the given matter; this is its elixir or quintessence, more precious by far, and more useful, to the artist, than is Nature herself. Before the philosopher has extracted the seed, or germ, Nature, in his behalf, will be ready to perform her duty.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the germ, or seed, of any substance?<br />\nA. It is the most subtle and perfect decoction and digestion of the substance itself; or, rather, it is the Balm of Sulphur, which is identical with the Radical Moisture of Metals.</p>\n<p>Q. By what is this seed, or germ, engendered?<br />\nA. By the four elements, subject to the will of the Supreme Being, and through the direct intervention of the imagination of Nature.</p>\n<p>Q. After what manner do the four elements operate?<br />\nA. By means of an incessant and uniform motion, each one, according to its quality, depositing its seed in the centre of the earth, where it is subjected to action and digested, and is subsequently expelled in an outward direction by the laws of movement.</p>\n<p>Q. What do the philosophers understand by the centre of the earth?<br />\nA. A certain void place where nothing may repose, and the existence of which is assumed.</p>\n<p>Q. Where, then, do the four elements expel and deposit their seeds?<br />\nA. In the ex-centre, or in the margin and circumference of the centre, which, after it has appropriated a portion, casts out the surplus into the region of excrement, scoriae, fire, and formless chaos.</p>\n<p>Q. Illustrate this teaching by an example.<br />\nA. Take any level table, and set in its centre a vase filled with water; surround the vase with several things of various colours, especially salt, taking care that a proper distance intervenes between them all. Then pour out the water from the vase, and it will flow in streams here and there; one will encounter a substance of a red colour, and will assume a tinge of red; another will pass over the salt, and will contract a saline flavour; for it is certain that water does not modify the places which it traverses, but the diverse characteristics of places change the nature of water. In the same way the seed which is deposited by the four elements at the centre of the earth is subject to a variety of modifications in the places through which it passes, so that every existing substance is produced in the likeness of its channel, and when a seed on its arrival at a certain point encounters pure earth and pure water, a pure substance results, but the contrary in an opposite case.</p>\n<p>Q. After what manner do the elements procreate this seed?<br />\nA. In order to the complete elucidation of this point, it must be observed that there are two gross and heavy elements and two that are volatile in character. Two, in like manner, are dry and two humid, one out of the four being actually excessively dry, and the other excessively moist. They are also masculine and feminine. Now, each of them has a marked tendency to reproduce its own species within its own sphere. Moreover, they are never in repose, but are perpetually interacting, and each of them separates, of and by itself, the most subtle portion thereof. Their general place of meeting is in the centre, even the centre of the Archeus, that servant of Nature, where coming to mix their several seeds, they agitate and finally expel them to the exterior.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the true and the first matter of all metals?<br />\nA. The first matter, properly so called, is dual in its essence, or is in itself of a twofold nature; one, nevertheless, cannot create a metal without the concurrence of the other. The first and the palmary essence is an aerial humidity, blended with a warm air, in the form of a fatty water, which adheres to all substances indiscriminately, whether they are pure or impure.</p>\n<p>Q. How has this humidity been named by Philosophers?<br />\nA. Mercury.</p>\n<p>Q. By what is it governed?<br />\nA. By the rays of the Sun and Moon.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the second matter?<br />\nA. The warmth of the earth -otherwise, that dry heat which is termed Sulphur by the Philosophers.</p>\n<p>Q. Can the entire material body be converted into seed?<br />\nA. Its eight-hundredth part only-that, namely, which is secreted in the centre of the body in question, and may, for example, be seen in a grain of wheat.</p>\n<p>Q. Of what use is the bulk of the matter as regards its seed?<br />\nA. It is useful as a safeguard against excessive heat, cold, moisture, or aridity, and, in general, all hurtful inclemency, against which it acts as an envelope.</p>\n<p>Q. Would those artists who pretend to reduce the whole matter of any body into seed derive any advantage from the process, supposing it were possible to perform it?<br />\nA. None; on the contrary, their labour would be wholly unproductive, because nothing that is good can be accomplished by a deviation from natural methods.</p>\n<p>Q. What, therefore, should be done?<br />\nA. The matter must be effectively separated from its impurities, for there is no metal, how pure soever, which is entirely free from imperfections, though their extent varies. Now all superfluities, cortices, and scoriae must be peeled off and purged out from the matter in order to discover its seed.</p>\n<p>Q. What should receive the most careful attention of the Philosopher?<br />\nA. Assuredly, the end of Nature, and this is by no means to be looked for in the vulgar metals, because, these having issued already from the hands of the fashioner, it is no longer to be found therein.</p>\n<p>Q. For what precise reason?<br />\nA. Because the vulgar metals, and chiefly gold, are absolutely dead, while ours, on the contrary, are absolutely living, and possess a soul.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the life of metals?<br />\nA. It is no other substance than fire, when they are as yet imbedded in the mines.</p>\n<p>Q. What is their death?<br />\nA. Their life and death are in reality one principle, for they die, as they live, by fire, but their death is from a fire of fusion.</p>\n<p>Q. After what manner are metals conceived in the womb of the earth?<br />\nA. When the four elements have developed their power or virtue in the centre of the earth, and have deposited their seed, the Archeus of Nature, in the course of a distillatory process, sublimes them superficially by the warmth and energy of the perpetual movement.</p>\n<p>Q. Into what does the wind resolve itself when it is distilled through the pores of the earth?<br />\nA. It resolves itself into water, whence all things spring; in this state it is merely a humid vapour, out of which there is subsequently evolved the principiated principle of all substances, which also serves as the first matter of the Philosophers.</p>\n<p>Q. What then is this principiated principle, which is made use of as the first matter by the Children of Knowledge in the philosophic achievement?<br />\nA. It is this identical matter, which, the moment it is conceived, receives a permanent and unchangeable form.</p>\n<p>Q. Are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, the Sun, the Moon, etc., separately endowed with individual seed?<br />\nA. One is common to them all; their differences are to be accounted for by the: locality from which they are derived, not to speak of the fact that Nature completes her work with far greater rapidity in the procreation of silver than in that of gold, and so of the other metals, each in its own proportion.</p>\n<p>Q. How is gold formed in the bowels of the earth?<br />\nA. When this vapour, of which we have spoken, is sublimed in the centre of the earth, and when it has passed through warm and pure places, where a certain sulphureous grease adheres to the channels, then this vapour, which the Philosophers have denominated their Mercury, becomes adapted and joined to this grease, which it sublimes with itself; from such amalgamation there is produced a certain unctuousness, which, abandoning the vaporous form, assumes that of grease, and is sublimised in other places, which have been cleansed by this preceding vapour, and the earth whereof has consequently been rendered more subtle, pure, and humid; it fills the pores of this earth, is joined thereto, and gold is produced as a result.</p>\n<p>Q. How is Saturn engendered?<br />\nA. It occurs when the said unctuosity, or grease, passes through places which are totally impure and cold.</p>\n<p>Q. How is Venus brought forth?<br />\nA. She is produced in localities where the earth itself is pure, but is mingled with impure sulphur.</p>\n<p>Q. What power does the vapour, which we have recently mentioned, possess in the centre of the earth?<br />\nA. By its continual progress it has the power of perpetually rarefying whatsoever is crude and impure, and of successively attracting to itself all that is pure around it.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the seed of the first matter of all things?<br />\nA. The first matter of things, that is to say, the matter of principiating principles is begotten by Nature, without the assistance of any other seed; in other words, Nature receives the matter from the elements, whence it subsequently brings forth the seed.</p>\n<p>Q. What, absolutely speaking, is therefore the seed of things?<br />\nA. The seed in a body is no other thing than a congealed air, or a humid vapour, which is useless except it be dissolved by a warm vapour.</p>\n<p>Q. How is the generation of seed comprised in the metallic kingdom?<br />\nA. By the artifice of Archeus the four elements, in the first generation of Nature, distil a ponderous vapour of water into the centre of the earth ; this is the seed of metals, and it is called Mercury, not on account of its essence, but because of its fluidity, and the facility with which it will adhere to each and every thing.</p>\n<p>Q. Why is this vapour compared to sulphur?<br />\nA. Because of its internal heat.</p>\n<p>Q. From what species of Mercury are we to conclude that the metals are composed?<br />\nA. The reference is exclusively to the Mercury of the Philosophers, and in no sense to the common or vulgar substance, which cannot become a seed, seeing that, like other metals, it already contains its own seed.</p>\n<p>Q. What, therefore, must actually be accepted as the subject of our matter?<br />\nA. The seed alone, otherwise the fixed grain, and not the whole body, which is differentiated into Sulphur, or living male, and into Mercury, or living female.</p>\n<p>Q. What operation must be afterwards performed<br />\nA. They must be joined together, so that they may form a germ, after which they will proceed to the procreation of a fruit which is conformed to their nature.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the part of the artist in this operation?<br />\nA. The artist must do nothing but separate that which is subtle from that which is gross.</p>\n<p>Q. To what, therefore, is the whole philosophic combination reduced?<br />\nA. The development of one into two, and the reduction of two into one, and nothing further.</p>\n<p>Q. Whither must we turn for the seed and life of meals and minerals?<br />\nA. The seed of minerals is properly the water which exists in the centre<br />\nAnd the heart of the minerals.</p>\n<p>Q. How does Nature operate by the help of Art?<br />\nA. Every seed, whatsoever its kind, is useless, unless by Nature or Art it is placed in a suitable matrix, where it receives its life by the coction of the germ! and by the congelation of the pure particle, or fixed grain.</p>\n<p>Q. How is the seed subsequently nourished and preserved?<br />\nA. By the warmth of its body.</p>\n<p>Q. What is therefore performed by the artist in the mineral kingdom?<br />\nA. He finishes what cannot be finished by Nature on account of the crudity of the air, which has permeated the pores of all bodies by its violence, but on the surface and not in the bowels of the earth.</p>\n<p>Q. What correspondence have the metals among themselves?<br />\nA. It is necessary for a proper comprehension of the nature of this correspondence to consider the position of the planets, and to pay attention to Saturn, which is the highest of all, and then is succeeded by Jupiter, next by Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and, lastly, by the Moon. It must be observed that the influential virtues of the planets do not ascend but descend, and experience teaches us that Mars can be easily converted into Venus, not Venus into Mars, which is of a lower sphere. So, also, Jupiter can be easily transmuted into Mercury, because Jupiter is superior to Mercury, the one being second after the firmament, the other second above the earth, and Saturn is highest of all, while the Moon is lowest. The Sun enters into all, but it is never ameliorated by its inferiors. It is clear that there is a large correspondence between Saturn and the Moon, in the middle of which is the Sun; but to all these changes the Philosopher should strive to administer the Sun.</p>\n<p>Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?<br />\nA. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the object of research among the Philosophers?<br />\nA. Proficiency in the art of perfecting what Nature has left imperfect in the mineral kingdom, and the attainment of the treasure of the Philosophical Stone.</p>\n<p>Q. What is this Stone?<br />\nA. The Stone is nothing else than the radical humidity of the elements, perfectly purified and educed into a sovereign fixation, which causes it to perform such great things for health, life being resident exclusively in the humid radical.</p>\n<p>Q. In what does the secret of accomplishing this admirable work consist?<br />\nA. It consists in knowing how to educe from potentiality into activity the innate warmth, or the fire of Nature, which is enclosed in the centre of the radical humidity.</p>\n<p>Q. What are the precautions which must be made use of to guard against failure in the work?<br />\nA. Great pains must be taken to eliminate excrements from the matter, and to conserve nothing but the kernel, which contains all the virtue of the compound.</p>\n<p>Q. Why does this medicine heal every species of disease?<br />\nA. It is not on account of tile variety of its qualities, but simply because it powerfully fortifies the natural warmth, which it gently stimulates, while other physics irritate it by too violent an action.</p>\n<p>Q How can you demonstrate to me the truth of the art in the matter of the tincture?<br />\nA. Firstly, its truth is founded on the fact that the physical powder, being composed of the same substance as the metals, namely, quicksilver, has the faculty of combining with these in fusion, one nature easily embracing another which is like itself. Secondly, seeing that the imperfection of the base metals is owing to the crudeness of their quicksilver, and to that alone, the physical powder, which is a ripe and decocted quicksilver, and, in itself a pure fire, can easily communicate to them its own maturity, and can transmute them into its nature, after it has attracted their crude humidity, that is to say, their quicksilver, which is the sole substance that transmutes them, the rest being nothing but scoriae and excrements, which are rejected in projection.</p>\n<p>Q. What road should the Philosopher follow that he may attain to the knowledge and execution of the physical work?<br />\nA. That precisely which was followed by the Great Architect of the Universe in the creation of the world, by observing how the chaos was evolved.</p>\n<p>Q. What was the matter of the chaos?<br />\nA. It could be nothing else than a humid vapour, because water alone enters into all created substances, which all finish in a strange term, this term being a proper subject for the impression of all forms.</p>\n<p>Q. Give me an example to illustrate what you have just stated.<br />\nA. An example may be found in the special productions of composite substances, the seeds of which invariably begin by resolving themselves into a certain humour, which is the chaos of the particular matter, whence issues, by a kind of irradiation, the complete form of the plant. Moreover, it should be observed that Holy Scripture makes no mention of anything except water as the material subject whereupon the Spirit of God brooded, nor of anything except light as the universal form of things.</p>\n<p>Q. What profit may the Philosopher derive from these considerations, and what should he especially remark in the method of creation which was pursued by the Supreme Being?<br />\nA. In the first place he should observe the matter out of which the world was made; he will see that out of this confused mass, the Sovereign Artist began by extracting light, that this light in the same moment dissolved the darkness which covered the face of the earth, and that it served as the universal form of the matter. He will then easily perceive that in the generation of all composite substances, a species of irradiation takes place, and a separation of light and darkness, wherein Nature is an undeviating copyist of her Creator. The Philosopher will equally understand after what manner, by the action of this light, the empyrean, or firmament which divides the superior and inferior waters, was subsequently produced; how the sky was studded with luminous bodies; and how the necessity for the moon arose, which was owing to the space intervening between the things above and the things below; for the moon is an intermediate torch between the superior and the inferior worlds, receiving the celestial influences and communicating them to the earth. Finally he will understand how the Creator, in the gathering of the waters, produced dry land.</p>\n<p>Q. How many heavens can you enumerate?<br />\nA. Properly there is one only, which is the firmament that divides the waters from the waters. Nevertheless, three are admitted, of which the first is the space that is above the clouds. In this heaven the waters are rarefied, and fall upon the fixed stars, and it is also in this space that the planets and wandering stars perform their revolutions. The second heaven is the firmament of the fixed stars, while the third is the abode of the supercelestial waters.</p>\n<p>Q. Why is the rarefaction of the waters confined to the first heaven?<br />\nA. Because it is in the nature of rarefied substances to ascend, and because God, in His eternal laws, has assigned its proper sphere to everything.</p>\n<p>Q. Why does each celestial body invariably revolve about an axis?<br />\nA. It is by reason of the primeval impetus which it received, and by virtue of the same law which will cause any heavy substance suspended from a thread to turn with the same velocity, if the power which impels its motion be always equal.</p>\n<p>Q. Why do the superior waters never descend?<br />\nA. Because of their extreme rarefaction. It is for this reason that a skilled chemist can derive more profit from the study of rarefaction than from any other science whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the matter of the firmament?<br />\nA. It is properly air, which is more suitable than water as a medium of light.</p>\n<p>Q. After the separation of the waters from the dry earth, what was performed by the Creator to originate generation?<br />\nA. He created a certain light which was destined for this office; He placed it in the central fire, and moderated this fire by the humidity of water and by the coldness of earth, so as to keep a check upon its energy and adapt it to His design.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the action of this central fire?<br />\nA. It continually operates upon the nearest humid matter, which it exalts into vapour; now this vapour is the mercury of Nature and the first matter of the three kingdoms.</p>\n<p>Q. How is the sulphur of Nature subsequently formed?<br />\nA. By the interaction of the central fire and the mercurial vapour.</p>\n<p>Q. How is the salt of the sea produced?<br />\nA. By the action of the same fire upon aqueous humidity, when the aerial humidity, which is contained therein, has been exhaled.</p>\n<p>Q. What should be done by a truly wise Philosopher when he has once mastered the foundation and the order in the procedure of the Great Architect of the Universe in the construction of all that exists in Nature?<br />\nA. He should, as far as may be possible, become a faithful copyist of his Creator. In the physical chaos he should make his chaos such as the original actually was; he should separate the light from the darkness : he should form his firmament for the separation of the waters which are above from the waters which are below, and should successively accomplish, point by point, the entire sequence of the creative act.</p>\n<p>Q. With what is this grand and sublime operation performed?<br />\nA. With one single corpuscle, or minute body, which, so to speak, contains nothing but faeces, filth, and abominations, but whence a certain tenebrous and mercurial humidity is extracted, which contains in itself all that is required by the Philosopher, because, as a fact, he is in search of nothing hut the true Mercury.</p>\n<p>Q. What kind of mercury, therefore, must he make use of in performing the work? A. Of a mercury which, as such, is not found on the earth, but is extracted from bodies, yet not from vulgar mercury, as it has been falsely said.</p>\n<p>Q. Why is the latter unfitted to the needs of our work?<br />\nA. Because the wise artist must take notice that vulgar mercury has an insufficient quantity of sulphur, and he should consequently operate upon a body created by Nature, in which Nature herself has united the sulphur and mercury that it is the work of the artist to separate.</p>\n<p>Q. What must he subsequently do?<br />\nA. He must purify them and join them anew together.</p>\n<p>Q. How do you denominate the body of which we have been speaking?<br />\nA. The RUDE STONE, Or Chaos, or Iliaste, or Hyle--that confused mass which is known but universally despised.</p>\n<p>Q. As you have told me that Mercury is the one thing which the Philosopher must absolutely understand, will you give me a circumstantial description of it, so as to avoid misconception?<br />\nA. In respect of its nature, our Mercury is dual--fixed and volatile; in regard to its motion, it is also dual, for it has a motion of ascent and of descent; by that of descent, it is the influence of plants, by which it stimulates the drooping fire of Nature, and this is its first office previous to congelation. By its ascensional movement, it rises, seeking to be purified, and as this is after congelation, it is considered to be the radical moisture of substances, which, beneath its vile scoriae, still preserves the nobility of its first origin.</p>\n<p>Q. How many species of moisture do you suppose to be in each composite thing?<br />\nA. There are three--the Elementary, which is properly the vase of the other elements; the Radical, which, accurately speaking, is the oil, or balm, in which the entire virtue of the subject is resident--lastly, the Alimentary, the true natural dissolvent, which draws up the drooping internal fire, causing corruption and blackness by its humidity, and fostering and sustaining the subject.</p>\n<p>Q. How many species of Mercury are there known to the Philosophers?<br />\nA. The Mercury of the Philosophers may be regarded under four aspects; the first is entitled the Mercury of bodies, which is actually their concealed seed; the second is the Mercury of Nature, which is the Bath or Vase of the Philosophers, otherwise the humid radical; to the third has been applied the designation, Mercury of the Philosophers, because it is found in their laboratory and in their minera. It is the sphere of Saturn; it is the Diana of the Wise; it is the true salt of metals, after the acquisition of which the true philosophic work may be truly said to have begun. In its fourth aspect, it is called Common Mercury, which yet is not that of the Vulgar, but rather is properly the true air of the Philosophers, the true middle substance of water, the true secret and concealed fire, called also common fire, because it is common to all minerae, for it is the substance of metals, and thence do they derive their quantity and quality.</p>\n<p>Q. How many operations art comprised in our work?<br />\nA. There is one only, which may be resolved into sublimation, and sublimation, according to Geber, is nothing other than the elevation of the dry matter by the mediation of fire, with adherence to its own vase.</p>\n<p>Q. What precaution should be taken in reading the Hermetic Philosophers ?<br />\nA. Great care, above all, must be observed upon this point, lest what they say upon the subject should be interpreted literally and in accordance with the mere sound of the words: For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</p>\n<p>Q. What books should be read in order to have an acquaintance with our science?<br />\nA. Among the ancients, all the works of Hermes should especially be studied; in the next place, a certain book, entitled The Passage of the Red Sea, and another, The Entrance into the Promised Land. Paracelsus also should be read before all among elder writers, and, among other treatises, his Chemical Pathway, or the Manual of Paracelsus, which contains all the mysteries of demonstrative physics and the most arcane Kabbalah. This rare and unique manuscript work exists only in the Vatican Library, but Sendivogius had the good fortune to take a copy of it, which has helped in the illumination of the sages of our order. Secondly, Raymond Lully must be read, and his Vade Mecum above all, his dialogue called the Tree of Life, his testament, and his codicil. There must, however, be a certain precaution exercised in respect to the two last, because, like those of Geber, and also of Arnold de Villanova, they abound in false recipes and futile fictions, which seem to have been inserted with the object of more effectually disguising the truth from the ignorant. In the third place, the Turba Philosophorum which is a collection of ancient authors, contains much that is materially good, though there is much also which is valueless. Among mediaeval writers Zachary, Trevisan, Roger Bacon, and a certain anonymous author, whose book is entitled The Philosophers, should be held especially high in the estimation of the student. Among moderns the most worthy to be prized are John Fabricius, Francois de Nation, and Jean D'Espagnet, who wrote Physics Restored, though, to say the truth, he has imported some false precepts and fallacious opinions into his treatise.</p>\n<p>Q. When may the Philosopher venture to undertake the work?<br />\nA. When he is, theoretically, able to extract, by means of a crude spirit, a digested spirit out of a body in dissolution, which digested spirit he must again rejoin to the vital oil.</p>\n<p>Q. Explain me this theory in a clearer manner.<br />\nA. It may be demonstrated more completely in the actual process; the great experiment may be undertaken when the Philosopher, by the medium of a vegetable menstruurn, united to a mineral menstruum, is qualified to dissolve a third essential menstruum, with which menstruums united he must wash the earth, and then exalt it into a celestial quintessence, to compose the sulphureous thunderbolt, which instantaneously penetrates substances and destroys their excrements.</p>\n<p>Q. Have those persons a proper acquaintance with Nature who pretend to make use of vulgar gold for seed, and of vulgar mercury for the dissolvent, or the earth in which it should be sown?<br />\nA. Assuredly not, because neither the one nor the other possesses the external agent--gold, because it has been deprived of it by decoction, and mercury because it has never had it.</p>\n<p>Q. In seeking this auriferous seed elsewhere than in gold itself, is there no danger of producing a species of monster, since one appears to be departing from Nature?<br />\nA. It is undoubtedly true that in gold is contained the auriferous seed, and that in a more perfect condition than it is found in any other body; but this does not force us to make use of vulgar gold, for such a seed is equally found in each of the other metals, and is nothing else but that fixed grain which Nature has infused in the first congelation of mercury, all metals having one origin and a common substance, as will be ultimately unveiled to those who become worthy of receiving it by application and assiduous study.</p>\n<p>Q. What follows from this doctrine?<br />\nA. It follows that, although the seed is more perfect in gold, it may be extracted much more easily from another body than from gold itself, other bodies being more open, that is to say, less digested, and less restricted in their humidity.</p>\n<p>Q. Give me an example taken from Nature.<br />\nA. Vulgar gold may be likened to a fruit which, having come to a perfect maturity, has been cut off from its tree, and though it contains a most perfect and well-digested seed, notwithstanding, should anyone set it in the ground, with a view to its multiplication, much time, trouble, and attention will be consumed in the development of its vegetative capabilities. On the other hand, if a cutting, or a root, be taken from the same tree, and similarly planted, in a short time, and with no trouble, it will spring up and produce much fruit.</p>\n<p>Q. Is it necessary that an amateur of this science should understand the formation of metals in the bowels of the earth if he wishes to complete his work ?<br />\nA. So indispensable is such a knowledge that should anyone fail, before all other studies, to apply himself to its attainment, and to imitate Nature point by point therein, he will never succeed in accomplishing anything but what is worthless.</p>\n<p>Q. How, then, does Nature deposit metals in the bowels of the earth, and of what does she compose them ?<br />\nA. Nature manufactures them all out of sulphur and mercury, and forms them by their double vapour.</p>\n<p>Q. What do you mean by this double vapour, and how can metals be formed thereby?<br />\nA. In order to a complete understanding of this question, it must first be stated that mercurial vapour is united to sulphureous vapour in a cavernous place which contains a saline water, which serves as their matrix. Thus is formed, firstly, the Vitriol of Nature; secondly, by the commotion of the elements, there is developed out of this Vitriol of Nature a new vapour, which is neither mercurial nor sulphureous, yet is allied to both these natures, and this, passing through places to which the grease of sulphur adheres, is joined therewith, and out of their union a glutinous substance is produced, otherwise, a formless mass, which is permeated by the vapour that fills these cavernous places. By this vapour, acting through the sulphur it contains, are produced the perfect metals, provided that the vapour and the locality are pure. If the locality and the vapour are impure, imperfect metals result. The terms perfection and imperfection have reference to various degrees of concoction.</p>\n<p>Q. What is contained in this vapour?<br />\nA. A spirit of light and a spirit of fire, of the nature of the celestial bodies, which properly should be considered as the form of the universe.</p>\n<p>Q. What does this vapour represent?<br />\nA. This vapour, thus impregnated by the universal spirit, represents, in a fairly complete way, the original Chaos, which contained all that was required for the original creation, that is, universal matter and universal form.</p>\n<p>Q. And one cannot, notwithstanding, make use of vulgar mercury in the process?<br />\nA. No, because vulgar mercury, as already made plain, is devoid of external agent.</p>\n<p>Q. Whence comes it that common mercury is without its external agent?<br />\nA. Because in the exaltation of the double vapour, the commotion has been so great and searching, that the spirit, or agent, has evaporated, as occurs, with very close similarity, in the fusion of metals. The result is that the unique mercurial part is deprived of its masculine or sulphureous agent, and consequently can never be transmuted into gold by Nature.</p>\n<p>Q. How many species of gold are distinguished by the Philosophers?<br />\nA. Three sorts :--Astral Gold, Elementary Gold, and Vulgar Gold.</p>\n<p>Q. What is astral gold?<br />\nA. Astral Gold has its centre in the sun, which communicates it by its rays to all inferior beings. It is an igneous substance, which receives a continual emanation of solar corpuscles that penetrate all things sentient, vegetable, and mineral.</p>\n<p>Q. What do you refer to under the term Elementary Gold ?<br />\nA. This is the most pure and fixed portion of the elements, and of all that is composed of them. All sublunary beings included in the three kingdoms contain in their inmost centre a precious grain of this elementary gold.</p>\n<p>Q. Give me some description of Vulgar Gold ?<br />\nA. It is the most beautiful metal of our acquaintance, the best that Nature can produce, as perfect as it is unalterable in itself.</p>\n<p>Q. Of what species of gold is the Stone of the Philosophers ?<br />\nA. It is of the second species, as being the most pure portion of all the metallic elements after its purification, when it is termed living philosophical gold. A perfect equilibrium and equality of the four elements enter into the Physical Stone, and four things are indispensable for the accomplishment of the work, namely, composition, allocation, mixture, and union, which, once performed according to the rules of art, will beget the lawful Son of the Sun, and the Phoenix which eternally rises out of its own ashes.</p>\n<p>Q. What is actually the living gold of the Philosophers?<br />\nA. It is exclusively the fire of Mercury, or that igneous virtue, contained in the radical moisture, to which it has already communicated the fixity and the nature of the sulphur, whence it has emanated, the mercurial character of the whole substance of philosophical sulphur permitting it to be alternatively termed mercury.</p>\n<p>Q. What other name is also given by the Philosophers to their living gold ?<br />\nA. They also term it their living sulphur, and their true fire; they recognize its existence in all bodies, and there is nothing that can subsist without it.</p>\n<p>Q. Where must we look for our living gold, our living sulphur, and our true fire ?<br />\nA. In the house of Mercury.</p>\n<p>Q. By what is this fire nourished?<br />\nA. By the air.</p>\n<p>Q. Give me a comparative illustration of the power of this fire ?<br />\nA. To exemplify the attraction of this interior fire, there is no better comparison than that which is derived from the thunderbolt, which originally is simply a dry, terrestrial exhalation, united to a humid vapour. By exaltation, and by assuming the igneous nature, it acts on the humidity which is inherent to it; this it attracts to itself, transmutes it into its own nature, and then rapidly precipitates itself to the earth, where it is attracted by a fixed nature which is like unto its own.</p>\n<p>Q. What should be done by the Philosopher after he has extracted his Mercury ?<br />\nA. He should develop it from potentiality into activity.</p>\n<p>Q. Cannot Nature perform this of herself?<br />\nA. No; because she stops short after the first sublimation, and out of the matter which is thus disposed do the metals engender.</p>\n<p>Q. What do the Philosophers understand by their gold and silver?<br />\nA. The Philosophers apply to their Sulphur the name of Gold, and to their Mercury the name of Silver.</p>\n<p>Q. Whence are they derived?<br />\nA. I have already stated that they are derived from a homogeneous body wherein they are found in great abundance, whence also Philosophers know how to extract both by an admirable, and entirely philosophical, process.</p>\n<p>Q. When this operation has been duly performed, to what other point of the practice must they next apply themselves?<br />\nA. To the confection of the philosophical amalgam, which must be done with great care, but can only be accomplished after the preparation and sublimation of the Mercury.</p>\n<p>Q. When should your matter be combined with the living gold?<br />\nA. During the period of amalgamation only, that is to say, Sulphur is introduced into it by means of the amalgamation, and thenceforth there is one substance; the process is shortened by the addition of Sulphur, while the tincture at the same time is augmented.</p>\n<p>Q. What is contained in the centre of the radical moisture ?<br />\nA. It contains and conceals Sulphur, which is covered with a hard rind.</p>\n<p>Q. What must be done to apply it to the Great Work?<br />\nA. It must be drawn, out of its bonds with consummate skill, and by the method of putrefaction.</p>\n<p>Q. Does Nature, in her work in the mines, possess a menstruum which is adapted to the dissolution and liberation of this sulphur?<br />\nA. No; because there is no local movement. Could Nature, unassisted, dissolve, putrefy, and purify the metallic body, she would herself provide us with !he Physical Stone, which is Sulphur exalted and increased in virtue.</p>\n<p>Q. Can you elucidate this doctrine by an example?<br />\nA. By an enlargement of the previous comparison of a fruit, or a seed, which, in the first place, is put into the earth for its solution, and afterwards for its multiplication. Now, the Philosopher, who is in a position to discern what is good seed, extracts it from its centre, consigns it to its proper earth, when it has been well cured and prepared, and therein he rarefies it in such a manner that its prolific virtue is increased and indefinitely multiplied.</p>\n<p>Q. In what does the whole secret of the seed consist ?<br />\nA. In the true knowledge of its proper earth.</p>\n<p>Q. What do you understand by the seed in the work Of the Philosophers ?<br />\nA. I understand the interior heat, or the specific spirit, which is enclosed in the humid radical, which, in other words, is the middle substance of living silver, the proper sperm of metals, which contains its own seed.</p>\n<p>Q. How do you set free the sulphur from its bonds?<br />\nA. By putrefaction.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the earth of minerals ?<br />\nA. It is their proper menstruum.</p>\n<p>Q. What pains must be taken by the Philosopher to extract that part which he requires?<br />\nA. He must take great pains to eliminate the fetid vapours and impure sulphurs, after which the seed must be injected.</p>\n<p>Q. By what indication may the Artist be assured that he is in the right road at the beginning of his work?<br />\nA. When he finds that the dissolvent and the thing dissolved are converted into one form and one matter at the period of dissolution.</p>\n<p>Q. How many solutions do you count in the Philosophic Work?<br />\nA. There are three. The first solution is that which reduces the crude and metallic body into its elements of sulphur and of living silver; the second is that of the physical body, and the third is the solution of the mineral earth.</p>\n<p>Q. How is the metallic body reduced by the first solution into mercury, and then into sulphur?<br />\nA. By the secret artificial fire, which is the Burning Star.</p>\n<p>Q. How is this operation performed?<br />\nA. By extracting from the subject, in the first place, the mercury or vapour of the elements, and, after purification, by using it to liberate the sulphur from its bonds, by corruption, of which blackness is the indication.</p>\n<p>Q. How is the second solution performed ?<br />\nA. When the physical body is resolved into the two substances previously mentioned, and has acquired the celestial nature.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the name which is applied by Philosophers to the Matter during this period?<br />\nA, It is called their Physical Chaos, and it is, in fact, the true First Matter, a name which can hardly be applied before the conjunction of the male--which is sulphur--with the female--which is silver.</p>\n<p>Q. To what does the third solution refer?<br />\nA. It is the humectation of the mineral earth and it is closely bound up with multiplication.</p>\n<p>Q. What fire must be made use of in our work ?<br />\nA. That fire which is used by Nature.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the potency of this fire?<br />\nA. It dissolves everything that is in the world, because it is the principle of all dissolution and corruption.</p>\n<p>Q. Why is it also termed Mercury ?<br />\nA. Because it is in its nature aerial, and a most subtle vapour, which partakes at the same time of sulphur, whence it has contracted some contamination.</p>\n<p>Q. Where is this fire concealed ?<br />\nA. It is concealed in the subject of art.</p>\n<p>Q. Who is it that is familiar with, and can produce, this fire?<br />\nA. It is known to the wise, who can both produce it and purify it.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the essential potency and characteristic of this fire ?<br />\nA. It is excessively dry, and is continually in motion; it seeks only to disintegrate and to educe things from potentiality into actuality; it is that, in a word, which coming upon solid places in mines, circulates in a vaporous form upon the matter, and dissolves it.</p>\n<p>Q. How may this fire be most easily distinguished?<br />\nA. By the sulphureous excrements in which it is enveloped, and by the saline environment with which it is clothed.</p>\n<p>Q. What must be added to this fire so as to accentuate its capacity for incineration in the feminine species?<br />\nA. On account of its extreme dryness it requires to be moistened.</p>\n<p>Q. How many philosophical fires do you enumerate ?<br />\nA. There are in all three--the natural, the unnatural, and the contra-natural.</p>\n<p>Q. Explain to me these three species of fires.<br />\nA. The natural fire is the masculine fire, or the chief agent; the unnatural is the feminine, which is the dissolvent of Nature, nourishing a white smoke, and assuming that form. This smoke is quickly dissipated, unless much care be exercised, and it is almost incombustible, though by philosophical sublimation it becomes corporeal and resplendent. The contra-natural fire is that which disintegrates compounds and has the power to unbind what has' been bound very closely by Nature.</p>\n<p>Q. Where is our matter to be found?<br />\nA. It is to be found everywhere, but it must specially be sought in metallic nature, where it is more easily available than elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Q. What kind must be preferred before all others ?<br />\nA. The most mature, the most appropriate, and the easiest; but care, before all things, must be taken that the metallic essence shall be present, not only potentially but in actuality, and that there is, moreover, a metallic splendour.</p>\n<p>Q. Is everything contained in this subject?<br />\nA. Yes; but Nature, at the same time, must be assisted, so that the work may be perfected and hastened, and this by the means which are familiar to the higher grades of experiment.</p>\n<p>Q. Is this subject exceedingly precious ?<br />\nA. It is vile, and originally is without native elegance; should anyone say that it is saleable, it is the species to which they refer, but, fundamentally, it is not saleable, because it is useful in our work alone.</p>\n<p>Q. What does our Matter contain?<br />\nA. It contains Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.</p>\n<p>Q. What operation is it most important to be able to perform?<br />\nA. The successive extraction of the Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.</p>\n<p>Q. How is that done ?<br />\nA. By sole and perfect sublimation.</p>\n<p>Q. What is in the first place extracted ?<br />\nA. Mercury in the form of a white smoke.</p>\n<p>Q. What follows?<br />\nA. Igneous water, or Sulphur.</p>\n<p>Q. What then?<br />\nA. Dissolution with purified salt, in the first place volatilising that which is fixed, and afterwards fixing that which is volatile into a precious earth, which is the Vase of the Philosophers, and is wholly perfect.</p>\n<p>Q. When must the Philosopher begin his enterprise ?<br />\nA. At the moment of daybreak, for his energy must never be relaxed.</p>\n<p>Q. When may he take his rest?<br />\nA. When the work has come to its perfection.</p>\n<p>Q. At what hour is the end of the work ?<br />\nA. High noon, that is to say, the moment when the Sun is in its fullest power, and the Son of the Day-Star in its most brilliant splendour.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the pass-word of Magnesia?<br />\nA. You know whether I can or should answer:--I reserve my speech.</p>\n<p>Q. Give me the greeting of the Philosophers.<br />\nA. Begin ; I will reply to you.</p>\n<p>Q. Are you an apprentice Philosopher?<br />\nA. My friends, and the wise, know me.</p>\n<p>Q. What is the age of a Philosopher ?<br />\nA. From the moment of his researches to that of his discoveries, the Philosopher does not age.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id=\"footnotes:\" tabindex=\"-1\">Footnotes: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#footnotes:\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<p>He who created man the same also created science. What has man in any place without labour? When the mandate went forth: Thou shalt live by the sweat of thy brow, there was, as it were, a new creation. When God uttered His fiat the world was made. Art, however, was not then made, nor was the light of Nature. But when Adam was expelled from Paradise, God created for him the light of Nature when He bade him live by the work of his hands. In like manner, He created for Eve her special light when He said to her: In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children. Thus, and there, were these beings made human and earthy that were before like angelicals. ... Thus, by the word were creatures made, and by this same word was also made the light which was necessary to man. ... Hence the interior man followed from the second creation, after the expulsion from Paradise. ... Before the Fall, that cognition which was requisite to man had not begun to develop in him. He received it from the angel when he was cast out of Paradise. ... Man was made complete in the order of the body, but not in the order of the arts. – De Caducis, Par.

For fluxibility proceeds from Mercury and coagulation from Salt. Accordingly, if there be too much Salt it becomes too hard. – De Elemento Aquae, Lib.

For all metals are latent in Mercury, and they are all only Mercury. The same is to be concluded concerning Salt and Sulphur. Thus, as copper is the abundant redness of the three principles, so Lead is their blackness; but, at the same time, there are four colours concealed therein – the blackness, purged off from the three principles; redness, which contains a precipitate out of Mercury; whiteness, from the calcination of Mercury; and a certain yellowness derived from Mercury. Thus the grossness and the colours are alike due to Mercury, and Lead is, in fact, a black Mercury. – Ibid., c. 5. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fnref7\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn8\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>When the three prime principles have been purged of their superfluities, and from the said superfluities the imperfect metals have been generated, there remains nothing gross or crude, either in colour or substance, but only a very subtle nature of a white and purple hue. This is the most pure quality of Mercury, Salt, and Sulphur, most clear and excellent in form, substance, essence, and colour. These two essences, namely, the white and the purple, are separated by the Archeus, and out of the first fixed and coagulated, is formed silver, while from the purple there is generated gold, which is the most noble Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury, separated from all other colours, and consisting of purple alone. Its clayey or yellow appearance is accounted for by the subtlety and clearness of the metal, because all the dull colours are removed. In Silver the most prevalent colours are green and blue, which are respectively derived from the Mercury and the Salt, the Sulphur contributing nothing in the matter of colouring. On the other hand, in gold the purple colour is derived from Salt, the pellucid redness from Sulphur, and the yellow from Mercury. – Ibid., c. 8. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fnref8\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn9\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Verbenas adole pingues, et mascula tura. – Virg., Ecl. viii. 65. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#fnref9\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn10\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Alchemy is, so to speak, a kind of lower heaven, by which the sun is separated from the moon, day from night, medicine from poison, what is useful from what is refuse. – De Colica.

Autumnal Equinox 2002</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\" tabindex=\"-1\">Introduction <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/path_working/#introduction\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>&quot;Path-working&quot; is a comparatively new phenomenon in the Western Mystery Tradition, as it does not seem to have existed as an occult practice prior to the occult revival of the late nineteenth century. Yet nowadays it is an established practice amongst many schools of magical thought. Pat Zalewski reveals that it is part of the curriculum for a <em>Theoricus Adeptus Minor</em> of the Golden Dawn[1]; it is described in the writings of Dion Fortune[2], Israel Regardie[3], Melitta Denning and Osborne Phillips[4] to name but a few.</p>\n<p>Simply put, &quot;Path-working&quot; is the art of clairvoyantly investigating the Paths of the Tree of Life. Path-working as a technique seems to have developed from the clairvoyant practices of Adepts in the Stella Matutina - one of the off-shoots of the Golden Dawn:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another technique, making use of this faculty[^5], was described in a paper recording a lecture by Frater Sub Spe.[^6] The idea was to re-read the rituals, and then endeavour to re-tread the Paths astrally. One example given, was that the Seer should formulate in imagination a vast pylon, and within its gates he should visualise the Hebrew Letter <em>Tau</em>, the 32nd Path. This should be preceded by a study of the Ritual of the Theoricus Grade, especially the Rite of the Kerubic Stations. Then imagining himself passing through this Letter <em>Tau</em>, and entering the Pylon, he should make the appropriate Pentagrams and Hexagrams, and vibrating the Divine Names appropriate to that plane. The resulting vision should be similar to the passage of the Path in the ceremony, but whereas this latter was purely symbolic, the former may be real and dynamic, and may develop into an initiation in the true sense of the word. The same technique may be applied to every Path and to every <em>Sephirah</em>.[^7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, one should not imagine that when, nowadays, different people in the Western Mystery Tradition refer to Path-working they mean exactly the same thing. For example, in the Aurum Solis, Path-working is a means of raising ones consciousness from a lower <em>Sephirah</em>, to a higher one. The actual Path-working consists of a &quot;guided meditation&quot;: the leader or facilitator tells the Path-workers what to experience, rather than leaving it to their own imagination.[^8]</p>\n<p>Dion Fortune, on the other hand, is in favour of such guided meditations up to a point, but advises that the leader of the session (the Hierophant) should leave spaces where the Path-workers can engage in silent reflection, and thereby come up with their own individual insights. She also recommends her own particular method for the <strong>&quot;composition of place&quot;</strong>, i.e. the creation of the astral scene one experiences at the start of the vision.[^9]</p>\n<p>Again, one must assume that the Path-working envisaged by Zalewski is different to that attributed by Regardie to Brodie-Innes: the Path-workings required by a Theoricus Adeptus Minor is all 22 on the Tree of Life - a Th.A.M would only have been initiated into 9 paths by that stage of his progress through the order.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we can express some generalities about all forms of Path-working: they all concern learning from astrally experiencing the Paths of the Tree of Life; and they almost always feature the Tarot Trumps heavily. This is because Path-Working, being a visual exercise, needs some sort of visual focus: hence the images of the Tarot Trumps are the most convenient for this purpose, and often serve to frame the type of vision that ensues.</p>\n<p>I should here point out that in talking about the Paths of the Tree of Life, and Tarot Card attributions, I am mainly referring to the &quot;Golden Dawn&quot; attributions, which are the ones used by the majority of practitioners in the Western Mystery Tradition today. However, a significant number of people have argued for a different set of attributions, for example, Aleister Crowley. Although in his 1907 reference book 777 he published the Golden Dawn attributions, his later work on the Tarot, The Book of Thoth departs from this scheme in that &quot;The Star&quot; and &quot;The Emperor&quot; are placed on (what were) each others' paths ה and צ.[^10]</p>\n<p>This points to a field of what I am certain would be a fruitful field of future research, namely, to what extent does arbitrarily changing the symbols involved affect the nature of the Path-working.</p>\n<p>A different, though slightly related question is whether it matters if one uses the traditional Kirscher Tree of Life; or whether some version such as that designed by Isaac Luria is equally or more conducive to Path-working. This will be answered at a later date by my colleague J. S. Kupperman.</p>\n<h2 id=\"path-working-and-the-active-imagination\" tabindex=\"-1\">Path-working and the Active Imagination <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/path_working/#path-working-and-the-active-imagination\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>It seems unlikely that what began as an obscure reference in a secret Magical order would have become a popular practice in the Western Mystery Tradition, had it not been assimilated into Analytical Psychology by C G Jung. Jung developed a technique called &quot;Active Imagination&quot;, which is similar to Path-working in that it seems to be mightily similar to Clairvoyance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…[Y]ou choose a dream, or some other fantasy-image, and concentrate on it by simply catching hold of it and looking at it. … You then fix this image in the mind by concentrating your attention. Usually it will alter, as the mere fact of contemplating it animates it. The alterations must be carefully noted down all the time, for they reflect the psychic processes in the unconscious background, which appear in the form of images consisting of conscious memory material. In this way conscious and unconscious are united, just as a waterfall connects above and below.[^11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jung goes on to say that instead of merely observing the sequence of events, the individual takes part in the scene, as if he is not the controller of the fantasy sequence, but a participator or character therein. Although, to a certain extent, he looks on from outside, impartially, he is also an acting and suffering figure in the drama of the psyche. This recognition is absolutely necessary and marks an important advance.[^12] The ultimate effect of this is, according to Jung, to assimilate lessons from the Unconscious into Consciousness - it thus plays a vital role in the process of &quot;Individuation&quot; - i.e. Jung's term for the process of psychic healing, and the integration of all parts of the psyche.</p>\n<p><strong>Active Imagination</strong> does not make use of the Tree of Life, nor does it make use of the Tarot Trumps. Yet I believe there is a still a subtle connection. Firstly, Path-working does indeed rely on the Path-worker to <em>&quot;choose a dream, or some other fantasy-image, and concentrate on it&quot;</em> - it so happens that the fantasy-image in question is arbitrarily determined by the symbolism of the Tree of Life in general, and perhaps the appropriate Tarot Trump in particular. Moreover, the process of Path-working requires the Path-worker to recognise, just as in Active Imagination, that he is a character participating in the vision he is experiencing, not merely an observer, and certainly not its detached creator.</p>\n<p>Secondly, Jung himself first developed the Active Imagination technique by practising it himself, when he was going through a time of crisis in his life - he had been traumatised by his break-up with Freud. We may guess the extent of this trauma because Jung said, describing the importance of being involved in the vision as opposed to merely an observer, that it is meant to integrate the statements of the unconscious, to assimilate their compensatory content, and thereby produce a whole meaning <em>which alone makes life worth living and, for not a few people, possible at all</em> (my emphasis).[^13] Could Jung have been speaking impersonally about himself?</p>\n<p>During Jung's Active Imagination sessions, he noticed two types of fantasies recurring: one type was related to images from his own past, but another type were &quot;mythological, archetypal, spiritual, and religious&quot;.[^14] Jung did not understand how these were connected to his own past, although he did recognise that they were symbols of basic drives common to Mankind across the world and throughout history. This was how Jung began to form his theory of the Collective Unconscious.<br />\nThe irony here is that the symbolism of the Paths of the Tree of Life is &quot;mythological, archetypal, spiritual, and religious&quot; - because this is exactly with what the Hermetic Qabalah concerns itself. Primarily this is through its connection with Astrology, which has preserved the symbolism of the old Greek and Roman religions in an unbroken tradition for over two thousand years. Moreover, I believe that many of the Tarot Trumps are direct representations of Archetypes of the collective unconscious. Take for example, &quot;Death&quot;. Death has long been anthropomorphized as &quot;The Grim Reaper&quot;, and the thirteenth Tarot Trump (which represents the twenty-fourth path, from <em>Netzach</em> to <em>Tiphereth</em>) reinforces that symbolism. Just how powerful is this as an archetypal image? I received this account whilst researching this article: a woman, who at age five, experienced a series of vivid dreams whilst critically ill. Note that according to her, she had never at that age heard of any of this &quot;Death&quot; imagery.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The dream garden was quite large and I remember that if I stretched my neck up a bit that I could just see over the wall. There were burnt fields of wheat outside.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But my attention was strictly focussed on the stone slab (bier) on which I sat swinging my legs. At the top end of the stone were 2 pillars - one black, one white. The white pillar had red roses twined around it and meeting as a canopy with the white roses from the black pillar. I could smell the perfume as it always seemed to be a warm sunny day when I was there ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was someone else in this &quot;garden&quot; too. Sometimes &quot;he&quot; was there when I arrived, sometimes &quot;he&quot; just materialised onto the stone. Imagine if you will, a small child happily sitting at the feet of a skeleton, listening to what Death had to say. And &quot;talk&quot; we did. Well - I chattered/listened and Death placed thoughts in my mind. It worked. The word &quot;transformation&quot; came into it a lot. Sometimes Death would &quot;laugh&quot; (that translated as a ripple/warp in the garden space) over some private joke - like the one about not being able to go through the same door twice. &quot;He&quot; found that one very amusing. I remember always being confused which caused more ripples…[^15]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I asked her what she felt she had learnt from these dreams, she replied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This &quot;facet&quot; of Death communicated in riddle/oracular form which intrigued the child me. This seems to be the natural medium for the subconscious as seen in works of inspiration and humanity's holy books. It is a powerful imprinting medium methinks. I learnt that Death was a process, much like Life is seen to be. I learn that everything exists in a state of change. As a child I learnt that focus was my only reality. And all of this was very private and sustaining.[16]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hence, whereas it seems that with the Active Imagination, Jung was drawn inadvertently to the archetypes of the Collective Unconscious. In Path-working, the Hermetic student is deliberately given a set framework within which to explore those archetypes him- or her-self. If we continue the Jungian comparison, we can infer that just as in Analytical Psychology, Active Imagination is a vital tool to effect &quot;Individuation&quot;, in the Qabalah Path-working effects a similar kind of process - it is an aid to help the Path-worker progress along the initiatory path.</p>\n<p>But do the Paths of the Tree of Life really represent a valid set of Archetypes? It is possible to test this, by seeing how different individuals' experiences of Path-working compare. Let us assume that these individuals each explore a given path, each relying on their own &quot;clairvoyant faculty&quot; (or Active Imagination) to provide their data, and not passively indulging in a completely guided meditation. If the Paths are indeed Archetypal, we should expect to see that the visions produced all share common characteristics, which go beyond what is suggested by the conscious imagery of those Paths. In a series of surveys over the past 6 months, I did see that this was in fact the case.</p>\n<p>Let us take, for example, the Thirty First Path of the Tree of Life, which is associated with Fire, and with the Tarot Trump &quot;Judgement&quot;. I present three excerpts from Path-workings - the first, by myself, which I did approximately two years ago. The second two are accounts which I discovered much more recently: one is from the Aurum Solis, and the other is by the writer J. L. Williams.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...[W]hy associate Fire with Judgement? In a flash of inspiration the answer came - the Trial by Ordeal. In olden times fire was used as a means of trying a person. Whilst the literal use of real fire is obviously crude, yet the metaphysical equivalent is still valid. It is part of the Spiritual path to undergo a Trial by Ordeal - although it is painful, the truth (i.e. the constancy of ones commitment) will eventually ensure one wins through.<br />\nAlex Sumner</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...We become aware of a throng of beings therein, a throng scarcely perceptible even to our new consciousness, beings of a nature more entirely spiritual than we have previously encountered. The united gaze of great brilliant eyes is fixed silently upon us as we pass through their ranks. We are to be in some unknown manner put to the test, proved by the fire.&quot;<br />\nAurum Solis[^17]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is meant by this &quot;redeeming Fire&quot;? To many, this sounds overwhelmingly oppressive. However, nestled firmly in this evasive language is an important thought: When we release our worries, both corporeal and ethereal, to the process (that which is the tide of life, of the forces of the cosmos and that which gives us momentum, motivation and divine inspiration), we do not release our responsibilities - instead, we release all predestined thought, all guilt, all blame, all expectancy (no lust for result), and in the process we find ourselves empty and ready to WORK.&quot;<br />\nJ. L. Williams[^18]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first thing we notice is that in each of the three passages the Path-workers get the idea of a Trial by Fire, or Proving by Fire. The sense is that the Thirty First Path is encountered at an early stage of an Initiate's career (it joins <em>Malkuth</em> to <em>Hod</em>): hence, it represents an initiatory phase that the young aspirant has to go through. Specifically, it feels like a burning away of redundant aspects of the personality.</p>\n<p>Space prevents me from giving details from all the Path-workings I have surveyed, both mine and other peoples. But I have seen much evidence to indicate that generally, the symbolism of the Paths of the Tree of Life is such that different people tend to obtain similar results when working them. In my experience, the paths take on some of the nature of the Sephiroth which lie at their upper-most end, corresponding closely with my ideas of the grades to which those Sephiroth would be attributed. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The paths ק,שׁ,ה - Basic initiatory challenges for the aspirant;</li>\n<li>פ,צ,ר - qualities of the Personality;</li>\n<li>ס,נ,ע - the conflict between materialism (Sensuality) and asceticism (Spirituality) (N.B. these are the paths which form the bridge between the Personality and Individuality);</li>\n<li>ט,י,כ,ל,מ - qualities of higher Adeptship;</li>\n<li>ו,ה,ג,ח,ז - ways of making the transition to Supernal consciousness (these are the paths which &quot;Cross the abyss&quot;);</li>\n<li>א,ב,ד - highest, most abstract Theurgy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in all Path-working tends to make the Tree of Life far more personal to the individual. At first, the initiate probably only looks on the Tree of Life as a set of correspondences to be memorised: but after Path-working, i.e. experiencing the Tree at a psychic level, the correspondences are connected together in the Initiate's mind through the memories of the astral adventures. It thus becomes easier for the Initiate to invoke those forces in the future, because now they will stir his imagination vividly whereas before they would not.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the experience of Path-working seems to be that the Path-worker goes on a quest to find the lost parts of the self, and finds them through investigating the symbolism of the Tree of Life. When this is viewed in light of the use of the Major Arcana therein, it reinforces the pre-eminence of the Tarot as well - not just as a method of mere fortune-telling, but as a set of symbols of deep psychological significance. One of the side-effects of Path-working must inevitably be that afterwards, a given Tarot Trump is linked to the mystical revelation which the Path-worker experienced when investigating its corresponding Path. Hence the Path-worker cannot look at the Tarot again in the same light: before it was an arbitrary set of symbols; now they stir memories of great psychic import.</p>\n<h2 id=\"path-working:-a-suggested-method\" tabindex=\"-1\">Path-working: A Suggested Method <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/path_working/#path-working:-a-suggested-method\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The structure of the Path-working session will therefore follow the following lines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The preparation of the physical temple, and the Path-worker(s), by a suitable opening;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Composition of place. This will itself consist of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The visualisation of the starting-point for the path-working;</li>\n<li>The invocation of the magical forces involved.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Projection into the visualised scene;</li>\n<li>The main vision, which contrives to reveal to the worker the mysteries of the Path;</li>\n<li>The arrival at the destination-point;</li>\n<li>The closing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The preparation of the physical temple will involve furnishing it in the manner indicated by 777 - for example, one should use appropriate colours, incense etc. The opening in the very least will include the Lesser Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram.</p>\n<p>The starting point for the Path-working is the <em>Sephira</em> at the &quot;lower&quot; end of the Path. Hence, the composition of place begins with astrally forming a Temple which symbolically represents that <em>Sephira</em>. The <em>Sephirothic</em> Temple is aligned east-west, east being the direction of <em>Kether</em>, and west the direction of <em>Malkuth</em>. There are portals in the walls, corresponding to where the paths which connect to that <em>Sephiroth</em> would be on the glyph of the Tree of Life. For instance, <em>Yesod</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/path_working/yesod1.jpg\">Diagram</a></p>\n<p>A vital part of the Composition of place at this point consists of populating this temple with the appropriate God-forms. Among these will be the God-form that presides over the Temple (Hierophantic); those that represent the Officers of the Temple; the Kerubic forms which guard the four quarters; and the guardians of the Paths leading to and from the Temple.</p>\n<p>The Path-working begins by Opening the Temple, and by propitiating the Hierophantic God-form - to demonstrate that one has the right to be in that <em>Sephira</em> in the first place. At the very least this propitiation will consist of saluting with the appropriate grade-sign, and vibrating the Grand Name of that <em>Sephira</em> (e.g.: <em>Yesod</em> - &quot;<em>Shaddai El Chai</em>&quot;).</p>\n<p>Then, the Path-worker will need to propitiate the God-form who is the Guardian of the Path that they to work - to demonstrate that they are worthy to enter that Path. I suggest that this itself will at least consist of the Pentagram or Hexagram Ritual (or both) which is associated with the astrological or elemental forces of the Path.<br />\nThe following three tables give the correspondences - from a &quot;Golden Dawn&quot; point of view. For Zodiacal signs, the Hexagram ritual may be performed in addition to the Pentagram ritual, as the influence of the planetary can often be &quot;felt&quot; just as much as can the Sign's Triplicity.</p>\n<p>| <strong>Path</strong> | <strong>Tarot Trump</strong> | <em>(Supreme Hexagram Ritual of...)</em> |<br />\n| -------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- | --------- |<br />\n| 15       | The Emperor     | Aries                             | <em>Mars</em>    |<br />\n| 16       | The Hierophant  | Taurus                            | <em>Venus</em>   |<br />\n| 17       | The Lovers      | Gemini                            | <em>Mercury</em> |<br />\n| 18       | The Chariot     | Cancer                            | <em>Moon</em>    |<br />\n| 19       | Strength        | Leo                               | <em>Sun</em>     |<br />\n| 20       | The Hermit      | Virgo                             | <em>Mercury</em> |<br />\n| 22       | Justice         | Libra                             | <em>Venus</em>   |<br />\n| 24       | Death           | Scorpio                           | <em>Mars</em>    |<br />\n| 25       | Temperance      | Sagittarius                       | <em>Jupiter</em> |<br />\n| 26       | The Devil       | Capricorn <em>Saturn</em>                |<br />\n| 28       | The Star        | Aquarius                          | <em>Saturn</em>  |<br />\n| 29       | The Moon        | Pisces                            | <em>Jupiter</em> |</p>\n<p><strong>Path</strong>|<strong>Tarot</strong>|<strong>Trump</strong>| <em>(Supreme Pentagram Ritual of...)</em><br />\n...|...|...|...<br />\n12|The Magician| Mercury<br />\n13|The High Priestess| Moon<br />\n14|The Empress |Venus<br />\n21|The Wheel of Fortune| Jupiter<br />\n27|The Tower |Mars<br />\n30|The Sun |Sun<br />\n32|The Universe |Saturn| Earth</p>\n<p><strong>Path</strong>| <strong>Tarot</strong>| <strong>Trump</strong> |<em>(Supreme Pentagram Ritual of...)</em><br />\n...|...|...|...<br />\n11|The Fool| Air<br />\n23|The Hanged| Man| Water<br />\n31|Judgement| Fire| Spirit</p>\n<p>With the Planetary paths, only the Hexagram Ritual should be performed. Conversely, with the Elemental Paths, only the Pentagram Ritual should be performed.<br />\nHowever, one should note that according to 777, two of the Paths have double attributions: path 31, &quot;Judgement&quot;, to both Fire and Spirit; and path 32, &quot;The Universe&quot;, to both the planet Saturn and the element Earth. To be safe, I did two sets of Pathworkings for each of these paths. So in the case of Path 31, Shin, on the one occasion I worked exclusively with the Fire Pentagram and Fire Attributions; on the other, I worked exclusively with Spirit. Likewise with Path 32, <em>Tav</em> in its Saturn aspect, and <em>Tav</em> in its Earth Aspect.[^19]</p>\n<p>Therefore, with these two paths, the italicised Pentagram or Hexagram Ritual is meant to be an alternate ritual to be carried out on a separate occasion - not a complementary ritual to be used on the same occasion.</p>\n<p>When the Guardian of the Portal to the Path in question has been satisfied, the Path-worker then passes through the Portal into the Path itself.</p>\n<p>Here one should again vibrate the Divine (and Angelic) names associated with the Astrological or elemental powers to which the Path is attributed. The Divine Names will have been used already in the appropriate Pentagram or Hexagram Ritual. Pictures of a landscape corresponding to the forces of the Path will arise before the mind's eye - perhaps a three dimensional version of the scene represented in the Tarot key. Alternatively, the Path-worker may get a strong impression of a scene which fits with the attributions of the Path, but is unlike the Tarot card. In any event, the vibration of the appropriate names - and the foregoing rituals - should serve to call forth a scene which is at least appropriate to the Path.</p>\n<p>The first act of the Path-worker, on vibrating the names and establishing the scene is to remain still and call for a Guide to appear. The Guide will be a personification of the Path in question - in name, appearance, and demeanour. The Guide might be the character or one of the characters depicted in the Tarot key; it might be a God-form corresponding to that path; or it might be an Angel or Spirit qabalistically associated with the path. The Guide might also be a figure which defies easy classification but which nevertheless proves to be appropriate. In any event, the Guide will announce that it recognises the Divine and Angelic names which the Path-worker has been vibrating, and will give the correct sign in salute, where appropriate.</p>\n<p>A figure which appears but does not admit to recognising the Divine Names, or the correct Names, nor gives the correct sign, is not a proper Guide. It should be Banished immediately, and the Path-worker should again try to attract a real Guide.</p>\n<p>The main part of the Path-working will then consist of the Path-worker exploring the scene, accompanied by the guide. All the while, the Path-worker is attempting to discover, at the mystical, intuitive level, the innate meaning of the path. Practically, this will consist of trying to elicit answers to questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the symbolic significance of the scenery I am observing? What about the characters I can see in this vision?</li>\n<li>How does what I am experiencing relate to this Path's Tarot correspondence? To its Astrological or elemental correspondence? To its correspondence in the Sepher Yetzirah?</li>\n<li>How do each of these correspondences relate to each other?</li>\n<li>What about the magical power or powers associated with this Path? What do I need to know in order to exercise them properly?</li>\n<li>How do I make the transition from the mode of consciousness represented by the <em>Sephira</em> at the beginning of the Path, to that of the <em>Sephira</em> at the end?</li>\n<li>The last question is particularly important, as it is the one that enables the Path-worker to enter the destination <em>Sephira</em>, and thus bring the Path-working to its natural conclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ideally, the combined effects of the invocations, the visualisations, and the consideration of all the Qabalistic data regarding that Path will cause the Path-worker to have a flash of intuition which transcends the merely astral phenomena experienced during the Path-working session. This flash of intuition will not merely answer the Path-worker's questions, but will be a source of inspiration for him or her long after the Path-working session has finished.</p>\n<p>Assuming that this has happened, the Path-worker may then enter the destination <em>Sephira</em>, in the form of another <em>Sephirothic</em> Temple.

The element of Fire is very close kin to the idea of Spirit; so the letter Shin, belonging to Fire, may be taken to mean Spirit as well. There is a special reason why this should be so, although it only applies in later ages, since the introduction of the dogma that Spirit rules the four elements, and the formation of the &quot;Pentagram of Salvation&quot; connected with the Hebrew word IHShVH, Yeheshuah.</p>\n<p>&quot;With regard to Earth, it was considered adequate to make the letter Tau, belonging to Saturn, correspond also to Earth.</p>\n<p>&quot;These additions are clear evidence that the Tarot took definite and arbitrary steps to assert the new discovery in Magick some two thousand years ago; for no system is more rigid than a Hebrew system.

This paper represents my individual efforts to understand Whitehead’s philosophy more deeply by relating it to Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. There were two main reasons why I selected Buddhist philosophy as a way of engaging Whitehead’s philosophy more deeply. First, since I had some familiarity with Buddhist philosophy, I felt that relating Whitehead’s philosophy to this existing knowledge and experience would be an effective way to integrate it into my understanding. Second, after noticing a few intriguing similarities between Whitehead’s philosophy and Buddhist philosophy, I felt drawn to see what other similarities there may be, and to what extent these similarities stand up under closer scrutiny. Although I wanted to see in what ways these philosophies might converge, at the same time I felt it was important to honour their differences, and acknowledge that some of their similarities might be only superficial resemblances. Before discussing the similarities between Whitehead’s philosophy and Buddhist philosophy, however, I will briefly introduce these philosophies separately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whitehead-and-the-philosophy-of-organism\" tabindex=\"-1\">Whitehead and the Philosophy of Organism <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#whitehead-and-the-philosophy-of-organism\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) was a mathematician who later turned to philosophy. From 1900 to 1911 in Cambridge he collaborated with his former pupil Bertrand Russell on their <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, which attempted to deduce all of mathematics from strictly logical foundations. During the period from 1910 to 1924 Whitehead did work in the philosophy of science at the University of London and the Imperial College of Science and Technology. In 1924 at the age of 63, Whitehead accepted a position at Harvard University, where he focused on the development of his metaphysical system, which he called the philosophy of organism. Today, Whitehead’s philosophy is often referred to as process philosophy.</p>\n<p>According to Whitehead, “<em>the actual world is a process, and...the process is the becoming of actual entities</em>” (PR, p. 22). These actual entities “<em>are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything more real</em>” (PR, p. 18). An actual entity is not an inert and permanent substance, but a relational process of becoming: “<em>how and actual entity becomes constitutes what that actual entity is. ...Its ‘being’ is constituted by its ‘becoming’</em>” (PR, p. 23). This process of becoming is a creative synthesis into one actual entity of its many relations to other actual entities. Whitehead calls the process of unification <strong>a concrescence of prehensions</strong>, where prehensions are the ways in which other entities are taken in by, and felt within the entity, and where the concrescence is the creative process of pulling together these diverse prehensions of other actual entities into a novel, organic unity. Thus, “<em>actual entities involve each other by reason of their prehensions of each other</em>” (PR, p. 20). Because of this mutual co-constitution, “<em>you cannot abstract the universe from any entity...so as to consider that entity in complete isolation. ...In a sense, every entity pervades the whole world</em>” (PR, p. 28).</p>\n<h2 id=\"buddhism-and-the-mahayana-school\" tabindex=\"-1\">Buddhism and the Mahayana School <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#buddhism-and-the-mahayana-school\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Buddhism was founded in India around the 5th century BCE by Siddhartha Gautama, who is also known as the Buddha (i.e., the Awakened One). Over the course of hundreds of years, various forms of Buddhism developed and spread from India across much of East Asia. The <em>Theravada school of Buddhism</em> is the most traditional of the various schools of Buddhism, and bases its doctrines on the original teachings of the Buddha. The various <em>Mahayana schools</em>, in contrast, have more freely adapted and elaborated upon the historical teachings of the Buddha. All schools of Buddhism, however, share certain core doctrines. Central to the basic teaching (dharma) of Buddhism is the <strong>Four Noble Truths</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>there is suffering,</li>\n<li>there is a cause of suffering,</li>\n<li>there is an end to suffering, and</li>\n<li>there is a path to the end of suffering.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Buddha taught that all experience is fundamentally impermanent in nature, and that we suffer because we habitually resist this impermanence. We crave after a permanence that cannot be found, so we inevitably suffer. By cultivating selfless compassion [ <em>Chesed</em> ], and by reflecting and meditating on our experience, he taught that we can abandon our craving after permanence and thus attain freedom from suffering (<em>nirvana</em>).</p>\n<p>One of the core doctrines in Buddhist philosophy is that everything exists as a dependent arising (<em>pratityasamutpada</em>). According to the Buddha, all phenomena are dependent arisings, meaning not only that any process of arising is dependent upon prior causes and conditions, but also that the existence or establishment of any phenomenon is dependent upon other phenomena. In the <em>Madhyamika</em> (“Middle Way”) school of <em>Mahayana Buddhism</em>, the concept of dependent arising is also taken to mean that everything exists in dependence upon its own parts, and that everything exists in dependence upon the thought which designates it. In all these cases, the notion of dependent arising implies that phenomena lack independent existence. This implication is often expressed in terms of the doctrine of emptiness (<em>sunyata</em>): all phenomena are empty of any independent, separate essence of their own. This lack of inherent existence, however, does not imply that things do not exist at all. They do exist — but their existence is a dependent, not an independent, existence. The doctrine of dependent arising, therefore, avoids the extremes of substantialism (i.e., things exists as independent, separate essences) and nihilism (i.e., things do not exist at all).</p>\n<p>Dependent arising is also intimately related to the <strong>doctrine of impermanence</strong>: if things existed independent of causes and conditions, they would be permanent and unchanging; but since phenomena are impermanent and capable of change, they must arise in dependence upon causes and conditions. Another consequence of dependent arising is the law of cause and effect governing all action (<em>karma</em>). Because all phenomena arise in dependence upon other things, all events are the effects of previous events. The moral consequence is that our intentions result in actions that have inevitable causal consequences. Unwholesome intentions and actions result in a perpetuation of suffering, while wholesome intentions and actions result in beneficial effects, culminating in liberation from the cycle of suffering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"similarities-between-whitehead-and-buddhism\" tabindex=\"-1\">Similarities between Whitehead and Buddhism <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#similarities-between-whitehead-and-buddhism\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Having briefly introduced the philosophies of Whitehead and Buddhism, we will now examine some of their similarities. The primary areas of convergence that will be discussed are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>impermanence and process as fundamental aspects of reality,</li>\n<li>the emptiness and lack of substance of things,</li>\n<li>the relational and dependent nature of things,</li>\n<li>the notion of ignorance and mistaken perception,</li>\n<li>the possibility of freedom from ignorance and mistaken perception,</li>\n<li>the emphasis on subjective and experiential aspects of reality, and</li>\n<li>the fundamental limitations of language and philosophical systems in characterizing reality.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Kenneth Inada (1971, 1975) has also pointed out some similarities between Buddhism and Whitehead’s philosophy. As I will point out, however, the correspondences he makes differ in some respects from mine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"process-and-impermanence\" tabindex=\"-1\">Process and Impermanence <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#process-and-impermanence\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most obvious similarity between Whitehead’s philosophy and Buddhist doctrines is that both view existence as flowing rather than static. In Buddhism, this idea is expressed in terms of the impermanence of all phenomena, the fact that our actual experience is always changing and that all phenomena arise and pass away. We never find anything constant or permanent in our experience. For Whitehead, “<em>the elucidation of meaning involved in the phrase ‘all things flow’ is one chief task of metaphysics</em>” (PR, p. 208). In his process philosophy, the flow or process of things takes a central place. Indeed, the final real things of the world, according to Whitehead, are actual entities (PR, p. 18), and these entities are not permanent essences, but rather processes of becoming: “<em>how and actual entity becomes constitutes what that actual entity is. ...Its ‘being’ is constituted by its ‘becoming’</em>” (PR, p. 23). The actual entities of reality are thus never static, but are in a process of becoming and “perpetually perishing.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[NOTE: This is the basis of the game. Through the process of becoming, you enter the game. If you are successful in your becoming, then you will be able to continue. If not, you will fade away, or out.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Inada (1971) points out, however, Whitehead’s actual entities are not just processes of becoming. They also have an “objectively immortal” aspect that represents their potential for being prehended by other actual entities. An actual entity, according to Whitehead, is both a subject presiding over its own process of becoming, and a superject exercising its function of objectively immortality. These two irreducible aspects of the actual entity relate to the philosophical problem of acknowledging both permanence and change in reality. “There is not the mere problem of fluency and permanence. There is the double problem: actuality with permanence, requiring fluency as its completion; and actuality with fluency, requiring permanence as its completion” (PR, p. 347). Is there a Buddhist correlate, though, to the superject that represents the permanent aspect of reality? Inada suggests there is, since the Buddha taught not only the doctrine of impermanence, but also taught that there are certain structural features of experience, such as “the five <em>skandhas</em>, <em>twelve _ayatanas</em>, and eighteen <em>dhatus</em>” (Inada, 1971). These experiential structures, however, do not actually correspond well with Whitehead’s notion of objective immortality. For example, consider the five components of phenomena (<em>skandhas</em>): form and matter (<em>rupa</em>), sensations (<em>vedana</em>), perceptions (<em>sanna</em>), psychic dispositions or constructions (<em>samkhara</em>), and consciousness or conscious thought (<em>vinnana</em>). These Buddhist structures of experience more closely resemble various phases of concrescence in the becoming of an actual entity. The objective immortality of an actual entity, on the other hand, represents the entity’s potential for prehension by other entities, not phases of its concrescence. Rather than following Inada’s suggestion, I would suggest that a more accurate Buddhist correlate to Whitehead’s concept of superject is the notion that every impermanent phenomenon, every fleeting drop of experience, does not simply disappear without any trace, but always leaves behind consequences that enter into other moments of experience. In other words, the karmic consequences of each impermanent phenomenon constitute its objective immortality. Another way of stating this is that an entity’s relatedness to other entities (i.e., its emptiness of independent existence) is its permanent aspect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emptiness-and-lack-of-substance\" tabindex=\"-1\">Emptiness and Lack of Substance <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#emptiness-and-lack-of-substance\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The doctrine of impermanence is intimately related to the doctrine that all things lack inherent substantiality. The Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna argued that things cannot have separate essences because this would result in an unchanging world: “<em>If there is essence, the whole world will be unarising, unceasing, and static. The entire phenomenal world would be immutable</em>” (FWMW, p. 72). In other words, if something has its own separate essence, then it is entirely separate and without dependence upon anything else for its existence. As a result, it can never be affected or changed. Thus, if things had essences, then the whole world would be immutable and static, which is obviously false. The conclusion is that all things are empty of any such essence. This doctrine of emptiness (<em>sunyata</em>) is fundamental to Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. Similarly, Whitehead states that “<em>it is fundamental to the metaphysical doctrine of the philosophy of organism, that the notion of an actual entity as the unchanging subject of change is completely abandoned</em>” (PR, p. 29). Process philosophy departs from substance philosophy by denying any isolated, individual essence to things. The idea that things have essences is at best a useful abstraction, and at worst a profound misconception of reality: “<em>The simple notion of an enduring substance sustaining persistent qualities, either essentially or accidentally, expresses a useful abstract for many purposes in life. But whenever we try to use it as a fundamental statement of the nature of things, it proves itself mistaken</em>” (PR, p. 79).</p>\n<p>An important instance of this mistake is the Cartesian assumption that the human subject is a fundamental essence prior to human thought. Whitehead inverts the priority: “<em>The philosophy of organism...conceives the thought as a constituent operation in the creation of the occasional thinker. The thinker is the final end whereby there is the thought. In this inversion we have the final contrast between a philosophy of substance and a philosophy of organism</em>” (PR, p. 151). Similarly, a distinguishing feature of Buddhist philosophy is the doctrine of no-self (<em>annata</em>). As Buddhist practitioner-scholar B. Alan Wallace explains, <em>the self “is not a physical, psychic, or spiritual substance propelled through time; rather it is a sequence of dependently related events. It is dependent upon the body and the mind that are its basis of designation, upon other causes and conditions that give rise to the present state of its continuum, and upon the mental designation of the self</em>” (CR, p. 160). The self, however, is not a mere vacuity. Although it does not have an independent, separate essence, it nevertheless still has a dependent, interrelated existence. Whitehead echoes this with his statement that an actual entity is not lacking being entirely—rather, “Its ‘being’ is constituted by its ‘becoming’” (PR, p. 23). Thus, both Buddhist doctrine and Whitehead’s philosophy avoid the extremes of substantialism and nihilism, and propose that things have a relational, interdependent type of existence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"relational-dependent-nature-of-existence-and-causation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Relational, Dependent Nature of Existence and Causation <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#relational-dependent-nature-of-existence-and-causation\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In Buddhism, the emptiness and impermanence of phenomena are consequences of the fact that they are dependent arisings (<em>pratityasamutpada</em>). The concept of dependent arising has several meanings. The primary meaning of dependent arising is that any process of arising is dependent upon causes and conditions. For example, the original arising of my body in my mother’s womb was dependent on various efficient causes, such as certain events that transpired nine months before my birth. The subsequent arisings of my body were also dependent on causes, such as continued food, air, and water that were necessary to sustain it. One sense of dependent arising, therefore, is the intimate efficient causal connections between things. In Whitehead’s philosophy, this is the interdependence of actual entities at the level of causal efficacy: “<em>The deterministic efficient causation is the inflow of the actual world.... In so far as there is negligible autonomous energy, the subject merely receives the physical feelings, confirms their valuations according to the ‘order’ of that epoch, and transmits by reason of its own objective immortality</em>” (PR, p. 245). In one of his few explicit mentions of Buddhism, Whitehead explains that <em>this inflow into an actual entity of physical feelings in “the initial stage of its aim is an endowment which the subject inherits from the inevitable ordering of things conceptually realized in the nature of God. ...This function of God is analogous to the remorseless working of things in Greek and Buddhist thought</em>” (PR, p. 244). In addition, the causal dependence of things on each other implies that nothing exists apart from the web of causal efficacy, and that everything contains every other thing: “<em>An actual entity cannot be a member of a ‘common world’ except in the sense that the ‘common world’ is a constituent of its own constitution. It follows that every item of the universe, including all the other actual entities, is a constituent in the constitution of any one actual entity</em>” (PR. p. 148)</p>\n<p><strong>Causal efficacy</strong>, however, is only one of two major ways in which an actual entity prehends other actual entities: “<em>In each concrescence there is a twofold aspect of the creative urge. In one aspect there is the origination of simple causal feelings; and in the other aspect there is the origination of conceptual feelings. These contrasted aspects will be called the physical and the mental poles of an actual entity. No actual entity is devoid of either pole</em>” (PR, p. 239). The physical and mental poles of the actual entity, in other words, correspond to the dependence of the entity upon efficient, physical causes and upon final, conceptual causes, respectively. As Whitehead explains, “<em>the creative process is rhythmic: it swings from the publicity of many things to the individual privacy; and it swings back from the private individual to the publicity of the objectified individual. The former swing is dominated by the final cause, which is the ideal; and the latter swing is dominated by the efficient cause, which is actual</em>” (PR, p. 151).</p>\n<p>We have already seen that dependent arising in the sense of dependence upon efficient causes is the correlate in Buddhism to Whitehead’s efficient cause that dominates the physical pole of an actual entity. Is there a Buddhist correlate to Whitehead’s final cause that dominates the mental pole of an actual entity? Indeed, a very similar idea is found in other meanings of the Buddhist concept of dependent arising. In addition to arising in dependence on efficient causes, the doctrine of dependent arising also means that things exist or are established in dependence upon conceptual designation: “<em>Events are dependent for their very existence upon the power of the mind and convention that designates them</em>” (CR, p. 145). Thus, in addition to depending on their physical efficient causes, things also exist in dependence upon mental designation. In other words, an actual entity depends for its very determination as a particular existent upon the ingression of eternal objects through intellectual prehensions.</p>\n<p>The notion of dependent arising in Buddhism thus encompasses both physical and mental forms of prehension. Because it encompasses all the ways in which things depend upon each other, Inada (1975) suggests that this Buddhist concept is nearly identical to Whitehead’s principle of Creativity, which accounts for the integration of the plurality of actual entities into a web of interdependence. Although there is certainly a similarity between the two concepts, the Buddhist concept of dependent arising lacks the aspect of novelty that is essential to Whitehead’s principle of Creativity. In other words, the principle of Creativity implies more than just the interdependence of things — it also implies that the process of arising is an advance into novelty, and this aspect of the principle of Creativity is not present in the Buddhist doctrine of dependent arising.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ignorance-and-mistaken-perception\" tabindex=\"-1\">Ignorance and Mistaken Perception <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#ignorance-and-mistaken-perception\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>According to Buddhism, <em>the root of all suffering is our ignorance of dependent arising</em>. Based on this fundamental mistake, we imagine things to be permanent when they are impermanent, we imagine things to have isolated, independent existence when they are actually empty of any such independent existence, and we ignore the causal relationships between things. We then suffer when things change or pass away, or when we experience the unpleasant consequences of our prior actions. This ignorance is so deep that it is normally operative below the level of consciousness. The ultimate purpose of Buddhist practice is to become aware of this ignorance and change the habitual patterns of action that are based upon it.</p>\n<p>Although Whitehead’s philosophy did not originate in a soteriological context, it nevertheless contains ideas remarkably similar to the Buddhist doctrine of ignorance. First of all, like Buddhism, Whitehead associates the experience of suffering or evil with loss of things to the flux of becoming: “<em>The world is thus faced with the paradox that, at least in its higher actualities, it craves for novelty and yet is haunted by terror at the loss of the past, with its familiarities and its loved ones. It seeks escape from time in its character of ‘perpetually perishing’</em>” (PR, p. 340) “<em>The ultimate evil in the temporal world...lies in the fact that the past fades, that time is a ‘perpetual perishing’</em>” (PR, p. 340). Although both Buddhism and Whitehead associate evil and suffering with impermanence, they differ in that Whitehead roots evil in the impermanence itself, while Buddhist doctrine roots suffering not so much in impermanence but in our failure to come to terms with it.</p>\n<p>Another similarity between the Buddhist doctrine of ignorance and Whitehead’s philosophy is the idea that our normal conscious experience is mistaken or delusive. In Buddhism, due to our deep ignorance of dependent arising, we habitually perceive things as if they were separate essences. This mistaken perception, says Nagarjuna, is intimately related to the fact that we do not see the causal connections between things: “<em>If you perceive the existence of all things in terms of their essence, then this perception of all things will be without the perception of causes and conditions</em>” (FWMW, p. 69) [Chokhmah]. Whitehead presents a very similar view. For him, the more fundamental relational prehensions in the mode of causal efficacy are no longer apparent at the derivative level of presentational immediacy associated with normal consciousness: “<em>The former mode [of causal efficacy] produces percepta which are vague, not to be controlled, heavy with emotion: it produces a sense of derivation from an immediate past, and of passage to an immediate future. ...The percepta in the mode of presentational immediacy have the converse characteristics. In comparison, they are distinct, definite, controllable, apt for immediate enjoyment, and with the minimum of reference to past, or to future</em>” (PR, pp. 178-179). In other words, the distinct, definite, and isolated percepta of presentational immediacy are created by a process of ignoring the interdependence of things at the level of causal efficacy. “<em>Consciousness is only the last and greatest of such (formative) elements by which the selective character of the individual obscures the external totality from which it originates and which it embodies</em>” (PR, p. 15). The result of this obscuration is that “<em>consciousness only dimly illuminates the prehensions in the mode of causal efficacy</em>” (PR, p. 162).</p>\n<p>When the level of causal efficacy is ignored, the abstract, derivative percepta of presentational immediacy are mistaken as being the original concrete aspects of experience. This “<strong>‘fallacy of misplaced concreteness’</strong><em>...consists in neglecting the degree of abstraction involved when an actual entity is considered merely so far as it exemplifies certain categories of thought. There are aspects of actualities which are simply ignored so long as we restrict thought to these categories.</em>” (PR, p. 7). These ignored aspects of actualities are exactly their dependence upon causes and conditions. Thus, <em>the fallacy of misplaced concreteness is none other than the ignorance of the truth of dependent arising</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"freedom-and-emancipation\" tabindex=\"-1\">Freedom and Emancipation <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#freedom-and-emancipation\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The Buddha taught that it is possible to become free of suffering by cutting the root of our ignorance. This is possible because the truth of dependent arising implies that our very habits of ignorance are themselves impermanent, and thus all sentient beings will ultimately be liberated. In the Buddhist context, this liberation cannot be attained by mere intellectual understanding. It requires a profound transformation of the mind, typically over many years of contemplative practice.</p>\n<p>Whitehead’s philosophy was not created as a religious philosophy, as Buddhism was, with an explicitly soteriological purpose. Nevertheless, Whitehead does state that philosophy should reveal what has been obscured, and should serve to correct our mistaken perceptions: “<em>Philosophy is the self-correction by consciousness of its own initial excess of subjectivity. ...The task of philosophy is to recover the totality obscured by the selection [of consciousness]. It replaces in rational experience what has been submerged in the higher sensitive experience and has been sunk yet deeper by the initial operations of consciousness itself</em>” (PR, p. 15). In other words, the propositions of philosophy represent in rational experience what has been ignored or obscured by consciousness. Transformation is then effected by the inherent power of propositions as a lure for feeling at a deeper experiential level: “<em>The proposition becomes a lure for the conditioning of creative action. In other words, its prehension effects a modification of the subjective aim</em>” (PR, p. 273). Thus, the possibility of our own transformation is based on the creative ingression of intellectual feelings above and beyond physical prehensions in the mode of causal efficacy. “<em>The doctrine of the philosophy of organism is that, however far the sphere of efficient causation be pushed in the determination of components of a concrescence... beyond the determination of these components there always remains a final reaction of the self-creative unity of the universe</em>” (PR, p. 47). Whitehead’s name for this unity is the <strong>primordial nature of God</strong>. In addition to providing us with our potentiality for creative transformation, the consequent nature of God is also “the great companion — the fellow-sufferer who understands” (PR, p. 351). Inada (1975) suggests that the Buddha or Tathagata corresponds to the primordial nature of God, while the Bodhisattva corresponds to <em>the consequent nature of God, whose purpose is the attainment of value and intensity of feeling in the temporal world</em>. This correspondence seems accurate insofar as the Bodhisattva is dedicated to compassionate action in the world for the benefit of all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva, however, is not God but a highly evolved sentient being. As for the correspondence between the Buddha and the primordial nature of God, this would be more accurately stated as the correspondence between Buddha nature and the primordial nature of God, since the Buddha Gautama was also not God but an awakened sentient being.</p>\n<h3 id=\"experiential-and-subjective-nature-of-things\" tabindex=\"-1\">Experiential and Subjective Nature of Things <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#experiential-and-subjective-nature-of-things\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In contrast to materialistic philosophies of substance, <em>both Buddhist and process philosophies take reality to be fundamentally experiential in nature</em>. Whitehead leaves little room for doubt in his position on this matter: “<em>apart from the experiences of subjects there is nothing, nothing, nothing, bare nothingness</em>” (PR, p. 167). In addition, Whitehead’s “<em>final real things</em>” (PR, p. 18), <em>the actual entities</em>, are described as “<em>drops of experience</em>” (PR, p. 18). As for Buddhism, as a contemplative religious tradition, experience is the ultimate ground of reality. Beyond the common importance given to experience, Whitehead and the Buddha also shared a similar view regarding the relationship between philosophy and experience. For both, experience is the touchstone of truth for any philosophical system or concept. As Whitehead expressed it, “<em>whatever is found in ‘practice’ must lie within the scope of the metaphysical description. When the description fails to include the ‘practice,’ the metaphysics is inadequate and requires revision</em>” (PR, p. 13). As for Buddhism, the practitioner is told to test the doctrines against experience, and not blindly take them for granted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limits-of-concepts-and-philosophical-systems\" tabindex=\"-1\">Limits of Concepts and Philosophical Systems <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#limits-of-concepts-and-philosophical-systems\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Buddhist philosophy is formulated as a means to the end of liberation from suffering, and not as a final dogmatic metaphysical system. Although Whitehead’s philosophy was not formulated for explicitly religious purposes, he still has a similar attitude toward dogmatism: “<em>In philosophic discussion, the merest hint of dogmatic certainty as to finality of statement is an exhibition of folly</em>” (PR, p. xiv). Whitehead and Buddhism also share a similar view of the limitations inherent in language. In Buddhism, the ultimate truth is ineffable, and cannot be formulated or expressed in thought or concept. As for Whitehead, he assures us that “<em>philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles. Weakness of insight and deficiencies of language stand in the way inexorably</em>” (PR, p. 4). “<em>Language, in its ordinary usages, penetrates but a short distance into the principles of metaphysics</em>” (PR, p. 167).</p>\n<p>The Buddha and Whitehead, however, had different responses to these limitations of philosophy and language. For Whitehead, it implied that metaphysics was always subject to revision in light of deeper experience, insight, and understanding. The Buddha went further, though, to assert that it is possible to experience truth in an immediate, non-conceptual way. “<em>It is possible to experience a reality that transcends all conceptual frameworks once one’s mind is freed from all conceptualization. When first abiding in such a realization, one has no awareness of conventional reality at all. As one proceeds to full awakening, the challenge is to integrate this profound insight with one’s experience of relative truth, in all its diversity</em>” (CR, p. 150). This incomprehensible, integrated wisdom is appreciative of the unique value of each particular standpoint, and at the same time is not limited to any one point of view. It is even acknowledged that the Buddhist dharma itself cannot be put forward as an absolute truth. As the teaching of the way to end suffering, the Buddhist teaching is therefore not independently established as a final, absolute truth, but is rather a compassionate, responsive, dependent arising in relation to ignorance and suffering. To cling on to the Buddhist doctrines as absolutes, therefore, is inconsistent with the most fundamental principles at the basis of those very doctrines. In the words of Nagarjuna (FWMW, p. 83):</p>\n<pre><code>I prostrate to Gautama\nWho through compassion\nTaught the true doctrine,\nWhich leads to the relinquishing of all views.\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"a-critical-difference\" tabindex=\"-1\">A Critical Difference <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#a-critical-difference\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In contrast to Whitehead’s philosophy, Buddhist philosophy embodies a critical dialectical method that dynamically turns upon its own categories and doctrines. The Indian Buddhist sage Nagarjuna (circa 2nd Century, CE) applied this technique to the various categories of thought in Buddhist philosophy, with the goal of freeing the mind from clinging to philosophical constructs. Through subtle dialectical argument, Nagarjuna demonstrated that any concept or philosophical position, if taken as final and absolute, ultimately leads to logical contradiction. The successful application of this technique reveals that the concept or position is empty of any final or ultimate truth. Because the same technique can be used to show that the opposite concept or position is also empty of any final or ultimate truth, the result is that both extremes of thought are abandoned, revealing a middle way between extremes of dogmatic assertion and dogmatic rejection. Nagarjuna’s dialectical technique applied to phenomena of experience as well as to philosophical views shows that when reality is rigorously and carefully examined, no permanent, absolute, or independent entity, existence, or conceptual truth is found. This <em>“not-finding” is the discovery of emptiness</em>. It is not a positive conclusion or new experiential phenomenon, but a non-conceptual insight regarding what is not actually present in the nature of experience.<br />\nThe dialectical process does not even end there. If the discovery of emptiness is itself grasped and reduced to a conceptual conclusion or final experience, then Nagarjuna’s method can be applied again to reveal the emptiness of this object of grasping (i.e., the emptiness of emptiness). Another very subtle form of grasping can take place when Nagarjuna’s critical technique is itself grasped onto as a final truth. A consistent application of the dialectical method then will reveal that the technique is itself dependent on grasping. If there is no grasping to extremes, there can be no criticism. Therefore, even Nagarjuna’s own technique is empty. The dialectical method, therefore, has the ultimate effect of undermining itself, just as the successful application of any medicine will result in a state of health wherein the medicine is no longer useful. If there is no fixity or grasping, then Nagarjuna’s method is unnecessary, just a medicine is no longer necessary after an illness is cured. As long as we are poisoned with habits of grasping and suffer its consequences, however, the medicine of emptiness is relevant and valuable.</p>\n<p>Thus, to the extent that Whitehead’s philosophy has medicinal powers to dispel our ignorance of dependent arising, it is essentially in harmony with the spirit of the Buddhist teachings, even if it differs in some of its details. In spite of their differences, however, there are many significant similarities between these two philosophies. It is my hope that this paper will foster deeper understanding of both Whitehead’s process philosophy and Buddhist teachings, and help all sentient beings in their creative advance toward Buddhahood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bibliography\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bibliography <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_and_emptiness/#bibliography\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Garfield, J.

Central among these is the notion of a basic entity that is individuated in terms of what it ‘does.’ This type of functionally individuated entity is often labelled ‘<strong>process</strong>’ in a technical sense of this term that does not coincide with our common-sense notion of a process. Some of the ‘processes’ postulated by process philosophers are in agreement with our common-sense understanding of processes — temporal developments that can be analysed as temporally structured sequences of stages of an occurrence, with each such stage being numerically and qualitatively different from any other. But some of the ‘processes’ that process philosophers operate with are not temporal developments in this sense — they are, for example, temporal but non-developmental occurrences like activities, or non-spatiotemporal happenings that realize themselves in a developmental fashion and thereby constitute the directionality of time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What holds for all dynamic entities labelled ‘processes,’ however, is that they occur—that they are somehow or other intimately connected to time, and often, though not necessarily, related to the directionality or the passage of time.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"form\" tabindex=\"-1\">Form <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#form\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p><em>While process philosophers insist that all within and about reality is continuously going on and coming about, they do not deny that there are temporally stable and reliably recurrent aspects of reality.

Especially the standard interpretation of predicate logic in terms of static individuals with properties that are exemplified timelessly or at a temporal instant consolidates what is from the process-philosophical perspective an unhelpful theoretical bias. This has forced upon process philosophy a double role as metaphysical and metaphilosophical enterprise—pushing for a paradigm change, process philosophy has the double task of developing new explanatory concepts and providing arguments for why these concepts better serve the aims of philosophy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"becoming\" tabindex=\"-1\">Becoming <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#becoming\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In some process accounts, <strong>becoming</strong> is the mode of being common to the many kinds of occurrences or dynamic beings.

Substance metaphysicians recast this intuition as <em>the claim that the primary units of reality (called “substances”) must be static — they must be what they are at any instant in time</em> (time invariant). <em>In contrast to the substance-metaphysical <strong>snapshot view of reality</strong>, with its typical focus on eternalist being and on what there is, process philosophers analyse becoming and what is occurring as well as ways of occurring.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"process-metaphysics\" tabindex=\"-1\">Process Metaphysics <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#process-metaphysics\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p><em>If we admit that the basic entities of our world are processes, we can generate better philosophical descriptions of all the kinds of entities and relationships we are committed to when we reason about our world in common sense and in science:</em> from quantum entanglement to consciousness, from computation to feelings, from things to institutions, from organisms to societies, from traffic jams to climate change, from spacetime to beauty. <em>Moreover, results in cognitive science, some philosophers have claimed, show that we need a process metaphysics in order to develop a naturalist theory of the mind and of normativity.</em></p>\n<p>The bias towards substances seems to be rooted partly in the cognitive dispositions of speakers of Indo-European languages, and partly in theoretical habituation, as the traditional prioritization of static entities (substances, objects, states of affairs, static structures) at the beginning of Western metaphysics built on itself. In contrast, process philosophy shows fewer affinities to any particular language group and can allude to a rich tradition of reflection in many of the great schools of Eastern thought. As recently appeared, process philosophy also has an increasing practical dimension, since <em>only if we re-visualize our world as a system of interactions can we come to grips, conceptually and ethically, with the new phenomena of artificial life, artificial intelligence, and artificial sociality, and investigate the exceptionality of human capacities and the scope of moral obligation</em>. Thus contemporary <em>process philosophy holds out the promise of offering superior support for the three most pressing tasks of philosophy at the beginning of the 21st century</em>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It provides the category-theoretic tools for an integrated metaphysics that can join our common sense and scientific images of the world.</li>\n<li>It can serve as a theoretical platform upon which to build an intercultural philosophy and to facilitate interdisciplinary research on global knowledge representation by means of an ontological framework that is no longer parochially Western.</li>\n<li>It supplies concepts that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration on reflected technology development, and enable the cultural and ethical imagination needed to shape the expectable deep socio-cultural changes engendered by the increased use of technology, especially automation.</li>\n</ol>\n",

A light so bright that it traverses infinity.</p>\n<p>From my point of view, it looks something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>From the depth of my being rises the impulse.With enough power and faith, it bursts forth and engages the other. At that tangential moment/pt of contact, the “shock wave” spreads out in all directions, proportional to the impact/power of the interaction.</em> &gt;<em>It could be fleeting; it could be life changing.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/qkab/Diagram%20Kab3%20-%20Bullet.png\" alt=\"Like a bullet\" /></p>\n<p>In other words, everything that actually &quot;happens&quot;, occurs at the point of contact. Or, to be more specific, in the local area of “contact”, the meeting, or conjugal point.</p>\n<p>If a 2d object interacts with a 4d object, although this interaction might affect that 4d object in all 4 of its dimension, the 2d object would only be aware of the 2d interaction. If that contact is 2d, it is a 2d point of contact, and will only affect half of the 4d object/event.</p>\n<p>But for any point (whatever its dimension) to manifest, there must be a simple, powerful hadronic type of force that causes a 1d moment of “recognition”, of manifestation/form, yet it is one which has nothing but position (and intent?), perhaps shape and energy – but naught else! In some strange way, whatever the dimension, the only interaction really occurs at the actual point of contact.</p>\n<p>Hadronic energy = 1d energy – that is why it is so immensely powerful.</p>\n<p>It “holds” these energies for long enough for them to manifest.</p>\n",

And never stop.</em><br />\n<em>There is always a place of balance – the fulcrum upon which the two opposites rest.</em></p>\n<p>Most of my life I have been studying the ancient and modern texts of Judaism and Kabbalah. Combined with my mathematical background, and life-long fascination with the Quantum view. I have arrived at a four-dimensional, many-words view of the world, a view I call Quantum Kabbalah.<br />\nThis is derived from the insight that perhaps QP &amp; Kab are talking about the same realm, just using different language to describe it. Just as many claim that all religions are talking about the same God, or Divine realm, using different language and symbols to express this relationship.</p>\n<p>Growing up in the midst of this, studying texts translated from the Hebrew - with which I am familiar – to English, I had the insight that perhaps both QP &amp; Kab were speaking about the same things – just different language and symbols. The exciting part of this was that the “other” language was mathematics, while the former was Hebrew – neither of which was English, my mother tongue.</p>\n<p>Following the possibility that QP &amp; Kab might actually be speaking about the same realm, I ask the question – what shared characteristics can I identify?</p>\n<p>My method is one I call <strong>Pure Narcissism</strong>, where the only point of reference is you, yourself – what we call self-referential. The point of interaction, one dimensional, a thought, a feeling.</p>\n<p>The word narcissism has been perverted by modern psychology, based entirely on Freud’s idea of this particular human characteristic. I would like to use it in a pre-Freudian sense, and interpret it from its origins – the myth of Narcissus, the Greek youth who became enamoured by his own reflection in the water... and died. Which, by the way, is only one of the ways, most appealing in a grotesque manner, in which this could play out. And, as most of these Greek myths are, this is another of those love stories. Narcissus, rejecting Echo’s love, while pining for his twin sister. Echo, in the meantime has rejected Pan’s love, etc. etc. etc. The Greek gods definitely show basic, and ugly, human traits. And a basic tenet of our culture is that God is good, or for a human to believe in God is to strive to improve himself.</p>\n<p>In my interpretation, Narcissism is a topic that discusses human self-awareness.</p>\n<p>In my investigations into the material is identification of other as self. An empathic procedure and place yourself into the situation that you are exploring and trying to understand more deeply.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vibrational-space\" tabindex=\"-1\">Vibrational space <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/pure_narcissism/#vibrational-space\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If God spoke to us it would be with a wave/vibration. In it’s most basic form, all it needs is to be different, and then there can be communication.”Speaks/waters” .

Think of our instruments to measure and read this interaction – which on the most subtle level we call entanglement. They are human made, and thus suffer the imperfections and limitations of humans. Whereas we are divinely constructed, or at very least constructed by the same mind/ability, whether “nature” or something else, to be able to detect subtle frequencies that we cannot build machines to detect. -----&gt; <strong>Merkavah</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is an expression of “the waters cannot rise above their source”. Or the music heard can only be as good as the source played.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spirits\" tabindex=\"-1\">Spirits <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/pure_narcissism/#spirits\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Know that all the word sof this text are merely symbols (or representations) of the spiritual objects that they represent.</em> (Talmud Eser Sefirot).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Could not this be the case, except for our souls. Though our bodies might be the representation of our souls – the spiritual object referred to here. Once again, could a wolf not be the representation of a wolf spirit, and the mountain a mountain spirit and the stars, star beings, etc. etc?</p>\n<h2 id=\"time-and-space\" tabindex=\"-1\">Time &amp; Space <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/pure_narcissism/#time-and-space\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Aug 2019</p>\n<p>Everything material degrades, atom by atom. The universal mind, however, is unconcerned as to how long it takes, because it is beyond time and beyond space, being itself infinite.</p>\n<p>We, though, are bound in time. Thus we see it as a process, and we need to slow down during our lives, in order to extend the time of life. In fact, of any material (and some immaterial) object – your house, machines, you life, your love, your wealth, etc. Because only by slowing down, could we being to appreciate what we do have, and begin to be grateful. It is the difference between passing through life seeing from the window of a passing vehicle – drive-by tourism, or walking through the villages and countryside, with its smells and sights.</p>\n<p>Think of the bliss that you would enjoy spending one evening in love, or doing what you love. How it is timeless and often seems to last forever. Every moment is precious, every memory sweet. That only comes from a type of stillness, a slowing down – not through any fast racing by, on the way to the next thing. How bizarre that is, that the only way one can gain time is by slowing down... for time is not absolute (except in the minds of men), or to say that better, time is not the same experience for each one of us.</p>\n<p>Our purpose is to make peace with this dynamic, this paradox.</p>\n<p>If we remove time, it produces a feeling of fullness. If we remove space, one of emptiness. These are the doorways to a meeting with G!d or the mind of G!d.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-crossing\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Crossing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/pure_narcissism/#the-crossing\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Paradoxical nature of life<br />\n<img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/qkab/narcissism.png\" alt=\"Paradoxical nature of life\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whenever we move from the mundance to spiritual realms, there is a change of density – a “bending” of the light. Just as light entering water bends, so does the energy as it moves from one realm to the next.</p>\n<p>[Dim: In dimensional terms, when one looks at a 2d line from 3d, the space of perception has changed. From being planar to spherical. So it would change from a 4th dim perspective. Or more clearly, a circle in 2d becomes a sphere in 3d and a hypersphere in 4d.</p>\n<p>Or one can think of it as looking at oneself, or an event through a mirror.</p>\n<p>_Left is right, and right is left. _<br />\n<em>What is up, is down,</em><br />\n<em>and what is down must come up.</em></p>\n<p>This is called the “crossing”, for it is the only way to understand what happens when you cross the gap between the perceived and the occurrence, between the cause and the effect, the beginning and the end. And is symbolised as + in 2d, and X in 3d<br />\n.<br />\nGod is one half of the circle, the first half, the beginning. We need to complete the circle.<br />\nLight enters that circle, and Life begins. In Kabbalah, Life and Light are the same things. When it is spiritual, it is referred to as Light. When it is manifest/mundane, it is called Life. Simply, you could think of the circle as emerging, and still. God, the infinite being, is all of it - the circle, the space inside and outside of the circle. But something moves, and the circle begins to turn – or rather, energy flows down the one side of the circle, or, even better, the one side of the circle is energised. Think of it as a pendulum that has just enough energy to reach its nexus, but no more. It will need an extra push, some miraculous energy, to crest the top and return to its rest state at the bottom. Interesting enough, this nexus is a zero, or balance point too. In other words, the pendulum will stay a moment at its crest, before descending down, if it has enough energy to do so.</p>\n<p>Now, using the principle of the crossing, where up is down, the light descends till it reaches this place of existence, where life is manifest. It has just enough to cause it to reach this nexus, this zero-point, and then it is up to us to provide the energy for it to rise again. Use the pendulum image to understand this. Just turn it upside-down!</p>\n<p>In other words, though the dynamic that we are an expression of, is one whose impetus is downwards, it is up to us to invoke the will to rise up to complete the circle. This is called “influence from below”. As the Kabbalists say, “We are part of God’s healing.”</p>\n<p>In Kabbalah, creation is spoken of as a circle that extends equally in all directions, and is thus called balanced. Then the Holy Ari speaks of the Light of the Divine like a ray that enters this circle. We have a much richer vocabulary today. We can think of the 10 phases as dimensions, and thus understand how they are intertwined. For each higher dimension can be expressed in terms of a lower one. Yet it also speaks of this as a lightning bolt that descends via the sefirot, until it manifests in Malchut, the Kingdom, the manifest realm. However, we can only return via the central pillar, like an arrow that ascends or climb the ladder of discipline and practice.</p>\n<p>Many of us have this urge to rise above, embrace more, than just the mundance aspects of life. All philosphers, mystics and geniuses of all ilk have sought to penetrate, in one fashion or another, the mind of G!d.</p>\n<p>Admittedly many have reached hight levels of consciousness and amazing understandings and perception of the world around us. Yet were they truly enlightened, as the Son of God, or Satori, or Moslem Heaven – and is that the space that their consciousness was speaking from? Or were they still seeking?</p>\n<p>Judaism doesn’t even have such a concept, except that of prophecy – which no one knows how that was obtained, except that it ended with the demise of the last red heifer) – and of a meeting with God in the Throne room. But no state of enlightment.</p>\n<p>We end up with religion entering a stote of mind that would enable us to “receive” and accept the Messiah. Who will arise? Chosen by us, or God, or by himself or by the earthly powers?</p>\n<p>And for what purpose, I ask?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the glorification of God?</li>\n<li>Or power over mundanes?</li>\n<li>Understanding our purpose?</li>\n<li>Help humanity as a whole?</li>\n<li>Because you are called, have a driving, insatiable, deep need to understand?</li>\n<li>To find fulfilment, peace (shalom)?</li>\n<li>Because that’s just who you are and what you want to be?</li>\n</ul>\n",

Just as the question of whether the set of all sets is itself as set, the obvious reality in which we are born is a prededermined environment. It was here long before I was born, and will be here long after I am dead. So, It Itself is a &quot;something&quot;, even if just an existence. Though, if it has taken us, with our vaunted intelligence so many &quot;thousands&quot; of years to understand the little of what is going on around us that we do at present understand, whatever inhabits this universe, and designed it so explicitly, must &quot;know&quot; something we don't, something fundamental to this existence. And as such, is at the very least, a superior form of intelligence.)</p>\n<hr />\n",

These two directions, the blessing and the curse, are to be proclaimed on two mountaintops in the Land: Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Now it shall be, when the LORD your God has brought you into the land which you go to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.” (Deuteronomy 11:29)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today, Nablus rests between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, the mountains on which the Israelites were commanded to pronounce the blessings and curses upon entering the Promised Land. This is also the location of Biblical Shechem, the place where Abram built an altar to the Lord (Genesis 12:6–8).</p>\n<p>Each one of us has been given this same choice to follow Him or not; in fact, the entire direction of our lives depends on which path we choose—the path of His blessing or of His curse.</p>\n<p>Yeshua (Jesus) the Messiah also told us of two paths — the narrow path that leads to life — and the broad path that leads to destruction. Sadly, it seems that few choose the narrow path. Most walk that broad path of destruction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.” (Matthew 7:13–14)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"staying-on-the-path-of-blessing-during-trials\" tabindex=\"-1\">Staying on the Path of Blessing During Trials <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/blessing%20or%20curse/#staying-on-the-path-of-blessing-during-trials\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Sadly, human pride, love of sin, and opposition from spiritual forces of darkness keep many walking the broad path of destruction, preventing them from entering into a life of blessing through obedience to God. As well, too many new Believers think that coming to faith in Yeshua and living a life of obedience to God are supposed to make all the problems and trials of life disappear. Yeshua did not promise this. In fact, He assured us that in this life we will have trouble. He Himself was persecuted, as were His followers.</p>\n<p>Choosing to obey God’s commandments in times of trouble is not always easy, especially when the whole world seems to be going in a different direction. Going against the current can take a great deal of exertion and determination — whether for spawning salmon or for people desiring to live a righteous life. It takes effort to swim against the current. Even simply making the choice to obey God can be excruciatingly painful. We may not actually sweat drops of blood, but we may come to a crossroad in our lives where we must also decide whether to obey God’s will or to choose our own way — and the cost may seem beyond our ability to bear. But God has promised that His grace is sufficient for us in every circumstance. Choosing to obey God will lead to blessing; however, we may not receive our full reward until Heaven. For that reason, we must always live with an eternal perspective, not allowing the trials of life to weaken our faith.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.” (James 1:12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-steps-on-the-path-of-blessing\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Steps on the Path of Blessing <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/blessing%20or%20curse/#the-steps-on-the-path-of-blessing\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“For you are a holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.” (Deuteronomy 14:2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This <em>Parasha</em> emphasizes that the path of blessing includes not following false gods or false prophets. All elements of pagan worship must be purged from our lifestyle so that we may be the holy people that God has called us to be. The narrow way described in <em>Re’eh</em> includes God’s commandments regarding the consumption of clean and unclean animals: “You shall not eat any detestable thing.” (Deuteronomy 14:3)</p>\n<p>Although many Christians consider these dietary commands abolished, Yeshua did not support this kind of thinking. He made this astounding statement: “Don’t assume that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfil... Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 5:17–19)</p>\n<p>The path of blessing also includes giving tithes to the Levites, who were dependent on the people for their livelihood: “You shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he has no part nor inheritance with you.” (Deuteronomy 14:27)</p>\n<p>As well, generosity toward the poor is also important. God said we are to open our hand and our heart to give to the poor in our land:</p>\n<p>“If there is among you a poor man of your brethren, within any of the gates in your land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor brother, but you shall open your hand wide to him and willingly lend him sufficient for his need, whatever he needs.” (Deuteronomy 15:7–8)</p>\n<p>Prosperity and financial blessing are not simply the result of working hard. Neither is it owed to us because we are Believers. It is dependent upon exercising the spiritual principles of sowing and reaping. As we give, it will be given back to us (Luke 6:38). God will bless us as we sow generous seeds in giving to the poor and to God’s faithful servants.</p>\n<p>“You shall surely give to him, and your heart should not be grieved when you give to him, because for this thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand.” (Deuteronomy 15:10)</p>\n",

So is Chashmal!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All was fine, until we encountered electricity (<em>chashmal</em>). This was something we could only experience. We could not perceive it with any of our 5 senses. It was tremendously useful, and people were dying in their desire and need for its benefits and use. We did not hesitate at the door to this discovery, but rushed madly in - as if it was a new discovery of gold or diamonds - and began using this limitless font of energy we had discovered to benefit &quot;all&quot; [which as per usual, meant first those who could afford, or were lucky enough to be born into, access to it].</p>\n<p>No one thought to stop and the doorway and ask &quot;What is it?&quot;. Because we were still in the trance of the certainty of empirical measurements - as many still are. It is an essentially 2d comprehension of the world around us, rather like the behemoth. And so we rushed in, where angels might fear to tread.</p>\n<p>So onward intrepid explorers, armed with your electrically powered machines, and let us see what we can do... Well, we live in the <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/intention.html\">outcome</a>.

We were not aware of a lot of the following implications of this new force that followed the writ.</p>\n<p>And, in this time of lockdown, this decision is being tested. Just as the decisions that were made regarding <em>kashrut</em> were made in a time where certain context that have emerged were not yet present. At each step of evolution of the Jewish cultures and traditions, we have stepped forward into them, and, even though there might have been dissension in the ranks, eventually stepped forward into the new revolution.</p>\n<p>For instance, one man, Isaac Luria, the Ari, changed the course of Jewish evolution. Another Isaac..., not even an ordained rabbi, significantly influenced the way we conducted our affairs. Rambam, Maimonides, influenced many generations of Jews with his <em>Mishna Torah</em>. We had certain traditions that were clearly laid out during the temple era, which are no longer practised, and have, for the most part, been replaced by others.</p>\n<p>There are two major areas that need to take into account what is happening in the world around us, and not to bury our heads in the sand, saying &quot;God will save us&quot;. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/adam_eve.html\">Story of Adam and Eve</a></p>\n<p>The first is <em>kashrut</em>. The second is electricity.</p>\n<p>Let us begin with the latter. If we can no longer gather and take our services together, the best we have at this stage is to do it virtually. What if we recorded a shabbat service, and the screen automagically went on (ala <em>shaon shabbat</em>) and we could watch and participate in the service in one's own home.</p>\n<p>If we were allowed, we could even carry on the service together (ala <em>One Giant Leap</em>). This is the kind of collaboration we need. We cannot be held by these constraints that were interpreted by a bygone age. Just as the original tablets could be read by anyone in their mother tongue, so He would want us to see it through eyes that are true to the Beholder, and not trying to see what others see. If the intention is not to use it for spiritual upliftment, then it is not sanctioned. Remember, the truth is known to the One.</p>\n<h2 id=\"energy-is-energy-good-or-bad\" tabindex=\"-1\">Energy is energy - good or bad <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/#energy-is-energy-good-or-bad\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Energy is energy, whether good or bad, positive or negative, replenishing or diminishing.</p>\n<p><em>Chashmal</em>, electricity, as fire, is both and bad. To the universe, there is no difference – though to God there might be. Thus both are equal in the universal scheme of things – though the outcomes might be different.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it is a rallying call, a guiding beacon calling us, challenging us to “manifest” the upper in the lower, and thus transform the lower.</p>\n<h2 id=\"zero-waste-(energy)\" tabindex=\"-1\">Zero Waste (Energy) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/#zero-waste-(energy)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If the synergy is perfectly in sync, then there is <strong>zero waste</strong>, as all inputs will be used and all outputs nourish something in the chain of life [differentiate between local &amp; global in/outputs] (like the <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/oroborus.html\">Oroborus</a>).

It describes the line by its angle from the point of origin (with a baseline) and its distance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latter two introduces the concept of movement in a certain direction thus that of goal &amp; purpose. Male envisages movement as essentially linear. Thus, with power, he continues in a straight line to his goal, ignoring any collateral damage, and not knowing when he has crossed the line, except after the crossing. The discipline, and constraint, is to know when to stop, when you have reached the &quot;end&quot;.</p>\n<p>However, that is not the topic of the moment, just note that this now has three aspects, or parts, that can be designated: beginning, middle and end. This partition can be found elsewhere too, as past, present &amp; future, and inside, skin &amp; outside, etc. One could use this mapping to describe a three-dimensional space.</p>\n<p>This is often reduced further (by the effects of egotism, or narcissism) to a two-dimensional space of the border &amp; what is inside - ignoring the actual reality of what is outside the &quot;borders&quot;, however defined. For we &quot;<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/consciousness.md\">awaken to consciousness</a>&quot; inside, and begin to garner information through our skin of our vessels regarding the &quot;outside&quot;. If that outside is exciting, and inviting, and safe, we are more likely to respond to it, and be open to it. If it is not, we are more likely to create a harder shell of protection from a more hostile environment. This produces binary, us &amp; them, polarised thinking.</p>\n<p>On the outside is all that is unknown, and really contains the great adventure of life. For, is it not the Hero's Journey to venture out into the unknown, and, once having overcome all the challenges of his or her encounter(s) with the unknown, returns home a hero?</p>\n<p>The third polar fashion is an even more accurate representation of the dynamic of perception. Let us use sight as the example. Our eyes are drawn to look at something. Light travels in a straight line, so what you see is in line with the angle/perspective that you are looking at it from - thus we have angle and direction (and power). This angle is determined by the choice of the &quot;observer&quot; or if, participant, through his entanglement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"line\" tabindex=\"-1\">Line <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/line/#line\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>When we envisage a line, we envisage what is &quot;linear momentum&quot;, which is a point that moves along a certain trajectory (in this case, a straight line). However, that is incorrect. The line is actually a set of points, even though it looks like we &quot;draw&quot; the line. The collection we call, in this case, a line.</p>\n<p>Two ways to produce a line:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As described above</li>\n<li>By moving the background (an old movie trick). Remember, the background give the context of whatever &quot;story&quot; is occurring in the foreground.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"time-is-the-background\" tabindex=\"-1\">Time is the background <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/line/#time-is-the-background\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Time is the moving background in/upon which everything occurs, and in which our lives unfold. We spend much time trying to remain still, for things to remain as they are - even for a moment. So we practice meditation, to still our minds, so that we can be more prepared for this constant moving background of time in which we exist. Of course, the other option is to try and &quot;move faster than time&quot;. In other words, if I could fore-tell, prophecy, know the future, I would have out-smarted time. Or if I can avoid my time of &quot;death&quot; - perhaps the prime motivator for prophecy, if not a calling. But know this, time marches on inexorably - and to stop time - would be to stop life!</p>\n<p>Time actually &quot;is&quot;/becomes the story of your life. Your narrative unfolds in time... Thus we encounter the mystery of the entanglement of time and space - I would call them conjugates.</p>\n<p>How would you like it to end? Ideally, not in death, but having achieved your goals, &quot;completed&quot;, so as to say, your life. That you will die (inevitably), but that you would die fulfilled. The drive to reach the place of fulfilment, of peace, of love, or success, is extremely strong, and entwined with the survival instinct, you become so intimate with you own story, that you &quot;become&quot; the story - and lose yourself in it.</p>\n<p>Now this background upon which your particular life-story unfolds is a background that has a dynamic and momentum that is its own - and you are just like a leaf floating on the river, or a feather floating in the air, buffetted by the currents around you. You are born into the background, you will live in it, and die in &amp; from it. It is, and you are but just a moment in it.</p>\n<p>Thus you can</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ego: Fight this bg<br />\nThis is the alpha personality. The big person, who will make his stamp on history.</li>\n<li>Submission: Accept this bg<br />\nThis is the one who is disempowered, and submits to his fate.</li>\n<li>Flow: Merge with it</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"flow\" tabindex=\"-1\">Flow <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/line/#flow\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This is the ideal. It is to live as a servant to G-d, and try to obey His Will. That sounds so Biblical, doesn't it. So let's translate that into the much more complex modern vernacular. There are certain laws and principles of Nature and the Universe that if we don't obey, we will find ourselves in trouble. Try to ignore the law of Gravity, etc.</p>\n<p>What we don't take into account, that those areas that we are unable to measure, or unable to perceive, or are not even aware of, still continue to affect the system and our lives. This is the question that the Zen koan asks: &quot;What sound does the tree make in the forest when it falls, if there is no-one to hear it?&quot; Put more simply, even though it is unknown, it still can have a huge effect on the outcome.</p>\n<p>Think of it from a child perspective. As an adult, you know things that the child does not. You are aware of influences and effects and outcomes that the child is not. Hopefully he will in time, but that is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p>So it is with us, and our Father.</p>\n<p>This is exactly the scenario we are struggling with at present.</p>\n<p>But, let's keep our focus on the individual. It is easier to comprehend - and even perhaps more useful. Encountering this background through a patchwork collection of interactions, we create our taperstry - which I call my story. This is who I am. This is what I do. This is my name. This is my profession. I am a doctor, worker, employee, president... We differentiate and separate ourselves by our narratives. Do you agree with my version (thesis), or not (antithesis) - now you are a potential threat to who/what I am.</p>\n<p>If I seek conflict, or reject your version, we remain stuck in this perpetual cycle of thesis vs. antithesis. But, synthesis is a choice!</p>\n<p>Similar is my relationship with this background. I can submit, which is the general notion, and the easiest. Or I can try and fight it. If I lose, I pay the price for rejecting it. If I win, I am successful - but estranged from it. So I will need to surround myself with a bastion of others who will benefit similarly from my/our success. This requires us to create and maintain our version of the what is really happening in this background. So we build a &quot;system&quot;, a society, in which we can hold this narrative, which has succeeded for me and my supporters. The end result is that you believe so completely in this narrative that you relate to it as if the narrative (and not the actual event) is real - and made of real things that cannot be changed. [Ala <strong>Wisdom Mantra</strong> - G-d grant me the Wisdom...]</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is why it has been called an &quot;ego trip&quot;. Because your ego has identified (and been nourished) by this story, that you begin to fully live it - and thus now perpetuate it - so that it does become &quot;real&quot;. Real laws, real prison, real weapons, real killing.</p>\n<p>The success of this venture will always depend on how true its description of the background is.<br />\nSo, to the most balanced and productive relationship with this background within which we exist, would be to synthesise with it. To &quot;dance&quot; together with it. Like a surfer riding a wave to the shore. This is called &quot;<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/flow.html\">Being in the Flow</a>&quot;. It is attuning yourself to the current of time you are in. As we say: &quot;It is not the right time&quot;, &quot;It is time for you to...&quot;, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"formlessness\" tabindex=\"-1\">Formlessness <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/line/#formlessness\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What do we have? We have the background. We have the point - which we called the &quot;beginning&quot; - and it exists somewhere inside this background. This is the only point of reference we have, which we also refer to as &quot;the point of origin&quot;. This is a &quot;static&quot; point, in relation to whatever line is formed. If the line is continuous and coherent (can be tracked) - then we can always find the beginning... But, that point is not real anymore. It happened, and it could take billions of years for you to realise that. And the only place you can realise it from is your present point of awareness - which the moment you are aware of, it changes! Thus the only solution to this conundrum is to enter a state of formlessness and merge, become One, with the background, like a fish in the water. So that you can flow with the currents of time, holding your self, not your position or your place in the story. Remember, like reading a book. You remember your place so that you can return to that story and continue where you left off. But once you continue, you no longer need the bookmark. And to remember every bookmark along the way, would be foolish - and never let you get on with the story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"memories\" tabindex=\"-1\">Memories <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/line/#memories\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Are memories real?

Perfection reigns, endless peace and harmony, no disturbance, no ripple.... complete nothingness - and infinite ocean of bliss. Upon this background it is impossible to depict anything, to say anything. For how could one use finite minds to describe an infinite event? However, something changed, something shifted, something happened to disturb this endless emptiness, and we say that &quot;a point emerged&quot; ex-nihilo - out of nothing. We call this &quot;the beginning&quot;. This is know as the centre - or middle point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bow-and-arrow\" tabindex=\"-1\">Bow &amp; Arrow <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math/line/#bow-and-arrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://neshama.com/posts/img/qkab/math/gikatilla.png\" alt=\"Like an arrow\" /></p>\n",

In order to be sovereign, one has to have no dependencies on anything or anyone else. In other words, one would have to be completely self-sustaining&quot;. That is perhaps an interesting definition of G-d! It is patently obvious that nothing in existence is truly sovereign. The only possibility is that that which is or contains everything, would, in fact, by definition be self-sovereign.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We need the proper air to breathe. That air has to be &quot;produced&quot;. We need water to live. That water has to &quot;sustained&quot; else we die. We need food for nourishment. When hungry, we will eat anything. A hungry man is an angry man. Worse, is to eat toxic food - for then the person becomes toxic, and that can manifest in many If food is not made from food that is grown from the earth, would it not essentially be classified as a drug? And as such should be monitored? If a chemical agent is added to something that is imbibed, is it not essentially a drug? The active elements in the growing plants, from quinine to psilocybin, are not the same drugs - though the active element they contain might be chemically the same <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/\">extracting the &quot;spirit&quot; of the plant</a> and should not be labelled as drugs. Drugs are manufactured elements that affect our environment chemically. All the active elements found in plants need to be taken in the context/spirit in which they have grown. All drugs are best taken in isolation. (In fact there is little information on the effects of multiple drugs) ]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every other living thing is dependent on its environment for its continued existence. Just as every single human being is dependent on countless unnamed, unknown, invisible people who have enabled the environment in which we live. We awaken in this garden. Yes, it has its dangers - after all, the bane of all life is death. And death is the bonded sister of life. For the truth is, there can be no life without death. And those who believe they can cheat death, die - within or without - and often become dealers in death themselves. Let us say, in the beginning it might be just a pastime, but as death approaches, it will eventually become an obsession. It is perhaps the existential question that is being asked in these time: Are we more powerful than G-d? Can we &quot;cheat&quot; (I am sure they prefer the word &quot;overcome) death and achieve eternal life - thus becoming like G-ds! Truly having the power of life and death over mere mortals!</p>\n<p>Overcoming death means that your focus is death - that is why you become a death dealer. It properties to run under the banner of life. But it will ask the questions of &quot;Why do we die? Is there something we can tweak to slow or stop this process?&quot; This is the classic mechanistic approach. As if we are essentially machines, and thus if you improve the material... We have even upped it a notch. Perhaps if we tweak the defence system, we will improve the overall longevity of the entity under investigation. Unfortunately, that entity is us.</p>\n<p>Overcoming life means that your focus is life!</p>\n<p>Is it truly <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/sustainable/light_dark.html\">death</a> that we wish to overcome? Is it not life that you would rather live? Is not the ideal to live a &quot;good&quot; life - in all senses of the word? So would it not make sense to build communities around living a wholesome life? And instead of beginning at the top - as long as you believe in .... G-d, or money, or family, or... and start in the real empirical world. In the world of <em>Assiyah</em>, of Doing, this Kingdom of G-d, the world we live in (and the only one we know). If a person (young or old, man or woman) eats &quot;well&quot; - and by well I mean healthily (local, organic, seasonal food) - he has more chance of growing up hale and hearty - unless G-d has other plans. Because we know (besides the science, it is also simple common sense) that if you eat toxic food, it will make you toxic and sick. Thus how can we live in a society that justifies the manufacture of toxic food - or at least has toxins in it! How can we continue to live a life in which we are turning our water - the very life blood of our existence - toxic?</p>\n<p>Our vaunted cities are rat infested cesspools with patches of shiny veneers. Is it because we cannot look at ourselves in the mirror of what we have created for ourselves and recognise ourselves in the reflection of what we see around us. Can we not see the trees because of the thickness of the forest? We as a collective sit at this point of radical re-evaluation - just as all adults have passed through - where we need to take responsibility for our own lives. No mama, no pappa to bail you out. You are know the &quot;adult&quot;. This is &quot;our&quot; creation - this that we are in. Do we continue to barrel on doing the same things and expecting a different result? Or do we decide to begin to do things differently? And what is that difference? Let us gather under the Banner of Life. Let us work together to build a way for us to sustain and support our lives.</p>\n",

Composed of two equilateral triangles whose apexes are defined by the six radial arc points of a circle, this six-pointed star is an important esoteric symbol, associated with the heart Chakra in Tantric yoga and discovered in the ground plan of Stonehenge.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> It has long been though that it was Arabic alchemy that in the West most popularised this symbol of equilibrium between the opposed archetypical forces of fire (the expansive force represented by the upward pointing triangle) and water (the contractive force represented by the downward-pointing triangle). Since it was in the early Middle Ages that the hexagram began to be featured prominently in Jewish magical texts and amulets, most modern historians have concluded that it was probably through this Arabic source that the hexagram was most directly transmitted to the medieval Spanish Kabbalists. But since in the Arabic literature employing this symbol the hexagram is normally given a Hebrew derivation through the terms &quot;Solomon's Seal&quot; or &quot;Shield of David&quot; by which it is called,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup> it may well be that there was a continuous association of the Jewish esoteric tradition with this esoteric symbol of David and Solomon that preceded Islam. The Talmudic reference to the hexagram engraved on the seal ring of Solomon<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup> supports the possibility of an early association of the hexagram with Jewish esoteric understanding and practice reaching as far back as the biblical period.</p>\n<p>Gershom Scholem supports the contrary view that “the hexagram is not a Jewish symbol.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup> He does admit that this figure and its names “Seal of Solomon and Shield of David . . . go back to pre-Islamic Jewish magic”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\">[5]</a></sup>, but considers that the hexagram “had one and only one purpose in its career as magic: to serve as protection against demons.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\">[6]</a></sup>. But Raphael Patai, in his important book The Jewish Alchemists, has traced a very different history for the alchemical tradition that must cause a major revision of the received opinion concerning the relationship of Jews to alchemy and its hexagram symbol. As he reveals:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first nonfictitious alchemists of the western world live, as far as can be ascertained, in Hebraic Egypt. And the earliest amongst them was Maria Hebraea, Maria the Hebrew, or Maria the Jewess, for whom our chief source is Zosimus the Panopolitan. Zosimus is the first Greek alchemical author whose actual writings have survived. He lived in Hellenistic Egypt, about 300 C.E. . . . We can thus tentatively assign her to the third century C.E. at the latest.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the quotations from Maria’s teachings, cosmological principles appear that have been thought to emerge only later in the Kabbalah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”One becomes two, two becomes three, and by means of the third and fourth achieves unity; thus two are but one” . . . “Join the male and the female, and you will find what is sought.” . . . “If you do not render the corporeal substances incorporeal, and the incorporeal substances corporeal, and if you do not make the two bodies one, nothing of the expected will be produced.” . . . She (Maria) said: “The philosopher (Pseudo-) Democritus said . . . ‘Transform nature, and make the spirit which is hidden inside the body come out . . . Destroy the body, and make it become water, and extract that which is in it.’” . . . “The ‘water’ which I have mentioned is an angel, and descends from the sky, and the earth accepts it on account of its (the earth’s) moistness. The water of the sky is held by the water of the earth.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maria Hebraea reveals alchemy to be a sacred science much like the more theoretical sacred sciences of geometry, harmonics and number, the precise procedures of metallurgy, the first human technology, being studied and valued not only for their mundane usefulness but for what they can reveal of the principles governing both natural law and cosmic possibility. Her first quoted rule, which we are told “the Hebrew priestess shrieked,”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\">[9]</a></sup> seems to foreshadow the kabbalistic doctrine of the <em>Partzufim</em>, the divine personalitities. Appearing in the <em>Bahir</em>, the <em>Zohar</em> and Lurianic Kabbalah, are the five main such <em>Partzufim</em> related to the ten circles, called <em>Sefirot</em>, of the Tree of Life Diagram.</p>\n<p>The Tree is a diagram composed of ten circular <em>Sefirot</em> and the twenty-two paths connecting them. The names of the ten <em>Sefirot</em> both define the attributes of a single divine figure and the five Partzufim into which they are transformed in the course of cosmic history. These names are <em>Keter</em> (Crown), <em>Chokhmah</em> (Wisdom), <em>Binah</em> (Understanding), <em>Chesed</em> (Mercy), <em>Gevurah</em> (Judgement), <em>Tiferet</em> (Beauty), <em>Netzach</em> (Eternity), <em>Hod</em> (Splendour), <em>Yesod</em> (Foundation), <em>Malkhut</em> (Kingdom). As <em>Partzufim</em>, <em>Keter</em> is identified with <em>Arikh Anpin</em> (Long Face), the original <em>Partzuf</em> who is the source of the next two <em>Partzufim</em>, <em>Abba</em> (Father), identified with <em>Chokhmah</em>, and <em>Imma</em> (Mother), identified with <em>Binah</em>, whose continuous mating is responsible both for the continuous process of creation and the generation of the originally androgynous <em>Ze’ir Anpin</em> (Short Face), the son figure identified with the six <em>sefirot</em> from <em>Chesed</em> to <em>Yesod</em>, from whom the daughter-bride <em>Partzuf</em> of the <em>Nukvah</em> (Female), identified with <em>Malkhut</em>, separates in order to mate intermittently with <em>Ze’ir Anpin</em> and so both direct the course of Providence and generate the higher souls of the righteous. The six-<em>Sefirot</em> <em>Partzuf</em> of the son is clearly the most important, and may also be said to combine a divine upper triad (<em>Chesed</em>-<em>Gevurah</em>-<em>Tiferet</em>) with a human lower triad (<em>Netzach</em>-<em>Hod</em>-<em>Yesod</em>), a unification of the infinite and finite that fulfils and models the purpose of Creation. This purpose is the generation both of the supernal son and so achieve the unification of these two levels of divine sonship, a cosmic purpose previously presented as the priestly secret doctrine of the son.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\">[10]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Let us know apply the kabbalistic concept of the <em>Partzufim</em> to Maria Hebraea’s statement: “One [<em>Arikh Anpin</em> (Long Face)] become two [<em>Abba</em> (father) and <em>Imma</em> (mother)], two [<em>Abba</em> and <em>Imma</em>] becomes three [<em>Ze’ir Anpin</em> (the short face and son)], and by means of the third [<em>Ze’ir Anpin</em>] and fourth [<em>Nukvah</em> (female of <em>Ze’ir Anpin</em> and daughter-bride)] achieves unity [a metaphorically sexual unification]; thus two are but one.” The meaning of this “unification” of the transcendent or “incorporeal” with the immanent or “corporeal” is well understood by what the tenth-century Arab alchemist Ibn Umail understood Maria to mean by the descending water or angel through which nature can be transformed to realise the spirit within it: “As for her statement ‘[The water] descends from the sky’, she meant by this the child which they say will be born for them in the air, while conception had taken place in the lower (region); this being (through) the higher celestial strength which the water has gained by its absorption of the air.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\">[11]</a></sup> The sexual model, imputed not only to humans but to metals, is important because it sees the Great Work of alchemy to be such a unification of the opposing metallurgic procedures for dissolving the fixed and coagulating the volatile as can generate a more precious new being, “the child which they say will be born for them in the air,” one whose perfection consists precisely in the conjunction of both these purified qualities—truly a new definition of what I have shown to be the Hebraic secret doctrine of the son.</p>\n<p>Maria Hebaea’s alchemy also seems already to suggest use of the hexagram model, the descending “water of the sky” not only denoting the descending triangle of the hexagram but also the concept of the upper and lower waters in the Genesis creation account, which we shall later see can also be modelled by the hexagram and in a way whose clarification of otherwise inexplicable features of the biblical account reinforces the early association of the hexagram with the sacred science of the Hebraic priesthood. The alchemical revelation of Maria Hebraea would seem, then, to be a direct outgrowth of the an earlier and continuing Hebraic sacred science and to provide a link to the later theoretical elaborations of the tradition in the more sexually generative form of kabbalistic myth.</p>\n<p>Patai provides much evidence to show that “Jewish alchemists were the teachers of both Muslim and Christian alchemists in the Middle Ages, just as they had been of Hellenistic alchemists in antiquity.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\">[12]</a></sup> One Arab work, falsely attributed to Khalid Ibn Yazad, is particularly indebted to Maria Hebraea, as can be seen by the following quotation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But this dissolution and congelation, which I mentioned, is the dissolution of the body and the congelation of the spirit, and they are two but have one single operation, because the spirit cannot be congealed except with the dissolution of the body, and similarly the body cannot be dissolved except with the congelation of the spirit. And the body and soul, when they are joined at the same time, each acts on its partner, making it similar to itself. . . . For the composition of artifice or magisterium is the conjunction or matrimony of the congealed spirit with the dissolved body...<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\">[13]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again this essential alchemical marriage of opposites seems suggestive of the hexagram model, the “dissolved body”, signified by its ascending triangle, “joined at the same time” to the “congealed spirit”, signified by its descending triangle, a conjunction that represents the culmination of the Great Work of alchemy, the production of the “Philosopher’s Stone”. As Patai indicates, in considering the alchemical legends surrounding Solomon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The close association between Solomon and the philosopher’s stone is show by the fact that the materia prima of the stone was sometimes represented as the two interlaced triangles of “Solomon’s seal”. . . . the sign of the “fiery water”, since it consists of a combination of two symbols: that of fire, which rises upward and hence is symbolised by the upward pointing triangle, and that of water, which descends from the sky and is represented by the downward pointing triangle. The old midrashic interpretation of the Hebrew word for heaven, <em>shamayim</em>, namely that it is a combination of the words esh, fire, and <em>mayim</em>, water, was known by the alchemists.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\">[14]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Recognition of the coherence between the doctrines of alchemy and the Kabbalah appears in a Jewish sixteenth-century treatise entitled <em>Esh M’Saref</em> (The Refiner’s Fire):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But know that the mysteries of this wisdom (i.e., alchemy) do not differ from the supernal mysteries of the Kabbalah. For just as there is a reflection of predicaments in sanctity, so there is also impurity. And the sefirot which are in <em>Assilut</em> (the first kabbalistic world)... are also in <em>‘Assiya</em> (the fourth kabbalistic world of matter)... yea, even int hat kingdom which is commonly called Minerals, although on the supernal plane their excellence is always greater... Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, is of the type of the vulgar students of nature who set about contemplating the valleys and profundities of nature, but do not descend into its secrets, wherefore they labour in vain and remain servants forever. They give counsel about procuring the son of the wise, whose generation is impossible for nature. (2 Kings 4:14). But they can contribute nothing to his generation. . . .<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\">[15]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The great secret shared by both the Kabbalah and alchemy is that which I have termed the secret doctrine of the son, that “son of the wise, whose generation is impossible for nature,” and who unites the essential qualities of the higher and lower planes, of the infinite and the finite...</p>\n<p>In the Maria Hebraea of the second or third century C.E. Alexandria, we may see a union of Hebrew esoteric teachings with some seed elements of an Egyption Hermentic practice of metallurgy that bore the new ideological fruit of alchemical formulation.</p>\n<p>But at the same time in Palestime there was a parallel theoretical development that showed a similar concern with the opposing qualities of fire and water and so with the possible employment of the hexagram to symbolise their union. This is the most important text of Hebraic sacred science, the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>, in which the fire is correlated with the mother letter <em>Shin</em> and the head, water with the mother letter <em>Mem</em> and the abdomen, and the air, which mediates between these opposed elements and their upper and lower location, is correlated with the letter <em>Aleph</em> and the chest. As in alchemy, though differently, this text defines the process of generation the cosmic man. Given that in the latter alchemical tradition, the circumstances of upper fire and lower water betoken the model of the hexagram, referent to the hexagram in the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>, concerned as they both are with the same sacred scientific quest to study those features of theoretical or technological science whose precise process appear to reveal the structure and purpose of existence. One difference between these teachings, however, is that Maria Hebraea synthesises Hebraic sacred science with some early developments of metallurgy in Egypt while in the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> Hebraic sacred science is synthesised with the Pythagorian sacred science of Greece. But the most important point to be made is that somewhere between the second and third centuries C.E. there was a separate flowering of Hebraic sacred science both in post-Temple Palestine and diaspora Alexandria whose similarities would seem to imply the same source.</p>\n<p>The source is most likely to be the members of the priesthood deprofessionalised after the destruction of the Temple, who would have become private teachers of what must have been a long tradition of Temple sacred science. And one feature of this ancient science that appears to have surfaced alike in the teachings of Maria Hebraea and the <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> is a peculiar join definition of fire above and water below, which in the later alchemical tradition was identified with the figure of the hexagram and given a Hebrew origin in the names by which it was known, Solomon’s seal and the Shield of David. As with the discovery of Troy just where Homer had claimed it to be, so it seems reasonable to conclude from the long association of the hexagram with Hebrew kings that his geometric figure was, indeed, a particular aspect of the Jewish esoteric tradition going back at least to the Temple priesthood... It is appropriate at this point to review the method by which the hexagram is geometrically constructed. As will be seen, it is a method that recreates the primal acts of creation as they are defined from these very geometric processes in the esoteric traditions that have a geometric base.</p>\n<h2 id=\"footnotes\" tabindex=\"-1\">Footnotes <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#footnotes\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\" />\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See John Michell, <em>City of Revelation</em> (New York: David McKay, 1972), p. 55. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See &quot;Magen David&quot;, in <em>Encyclopedia Judaica</em> and Sholem, <em>Kabbalah</em>, pp. 362-368. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See Scholem, <em>Kabbalah</em>, p. 363 <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Gershom, Scholem, &quot;The Star of David: History of a Symbol,&quot; <em>The Messianic Idea in Judaism and Other Essays on Jewish Spirituality</em> (New York: Schocken Books, 1978), p. 259. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ibid., p. 264. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn6\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ibid., p. 266. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn7\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Raphael Patai, <em>The Jewish Alchemists</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995), p. 60. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref7\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn8\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ibid., pp. 66, 67, 68. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref8\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn9\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ibid., p. 66. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref9\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn10\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>For my comprehensive text-based history of this doctrine, see <em>The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah</em>, particularly pp. 30-73. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref10\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn11\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Patai, <em>The Jewish Alchemists</em>, p. 69. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref11\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn12\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ibid., p. 140. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref12\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn13\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ibid., p. 127. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#fnref13\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn14\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ibid., p. 28.

However, guilt is decided according to the criterion and biases of the legal context within which this guilt is being decided. In the case of religion, there is the application of the laws of God according to the perspective and understanding of that particular culture - all influenced by human foibles and weaknesses and desires.</p>\n<p>In fact, this premise of intrinsically evil, has resulted in the doctrine of &quot;Original Sin&quot;. Which proposes that God made us, and the world around us, essentially evil. If it is, in this case, up to Christ to redeem us, at worst. At best, for each one of us to make the right choices - even when we receive the wrong education - one that teaches us how to serve in society, but not how to deal with the moral, ethical or spiritual aspects of one's life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-create-evil\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why create Evil? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/original_beauty/#why-create-evil\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If God is Good, why create evil people? No. Rather, why create everyone evil, and then we need to spend the rest of our lives &quot;redeeming&quot; ourselves? It is like being born in debt, and having to spend the rest of your lives paying someone back for the debt you &quot;inherited&quot;.</p>\n<p>If one has a purpose, would you not want those that you exercise influence and control over to be performing their true work, expressing their G-d given gifts for the benefit of all? In other words, would not a true leader look after his people - not like a shepherd herding his sheep because as is said: &quot;The sheep spend all their lives afraid of the wolf, when it is the shepherd who they need to fear!&quot;? Ensure and enable them to express their best, obey the will of G-d, so as to say? Would not a King have to be a priest as well? Or at least a Shaman? Able to guide His people - just like Moses?</p>\n<p>Instead we fritter our way our time and resources, and many lives, fighting this very evil placed in us? Perhaps this acceptance of an intrinsic sin in the human being is incorrect. We arrive neither intrinsically good nor bad and are formed and &quot;taught&quot; by the influences and general environment we grow up in. We are shaped by what we encounter during our &quot;<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/consciousness.md\">awakening into consciousness</a>&quot;.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are surrounded by love, you learn love</li>\n<li>If you are surrounded by anger and violence, you learn love that is consists of anger and violence...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this realm, there are no absolutes - besides birth &amp; death. &quot;Every natural law has an exception&quot;. So, there are some who are bad - and some who are good. And their influences wax and wane, in an eternal cosmic dance. Thus, any system has to take into account the bad extremes. In the words of Warren Buffet: &quot;It is not a victory that will ever wipe you out. But one loss certainly can.&quot; In every barrel, in every toss, there is the possibility (however slight) of a &quot;bad&quot; apple.</p>\n",

[Perhaps the very term Quantum Physics is an anachronism, like Real TV. Perhaps this &quot;Quantum Physics&quot; is not physics at all, as everything it talks about is non-physical actually. Yet it does a good job of &quot;proving&quot; its reality. In the same way, if the Shaman could produce results that could be empirically measured (according to the accepted, standard measurements - those measurements that are acceptable to the accepted rules of measurement. This is the same as the impact of a new legal system on indigenous people - which needs always to be backed up by military power) who now have to accept new measurements of social behaviour imposed by the ruling class (which is what actually makes them the &quot;ruling class&quot; - not any inherent human characteristics. Which is why we have more popular respect for the successful entrepreneur, rather than the privileged noblesse. We look at them with the fascinated stare of the mouse watching the snake as it slithers towards it, hoping that it will strike the mouse frozen beside it. We know that these people have the ability to destroy our lives in a moment if they so wish. We fight to hold back their desire to control everyone and everything. But we must remember that they are just scared of the Divine nature of the universe and themselves - which is the last thing they will be able to acknowledge, having spent their entire existence catering to the empirical (measurable according to standard accepted measurements) human nature of their being. And this is an attempt to build walls around the terror of extinction, of not being anymore, forgotten in the ashes of time. So they need to build huge edifices to their greatness, pyramid and towers. They have to fight great wars and accomplish grandiouse (and often idiotic) things - to impress everyone, and everyone can applaud their greatness.</p>\n<p>But I ask you O great ones who rule over us and wish to control us like ants, like little slaves to do their bidding, and feed their petty, mostly material, desires with our juices - how large is your pyramid next to the giant nebula that gaze upon us in pity? If you are remembered for a 1000 years, O my Emperor, how long is that in the eyes of our very planet, which your science says has been here for 15,000,000,000 years? Well, I say, however, or whatever built this planet, is going to be remembered for far longer than any one of you will be. And is capable of producing things far greater than any of you, or your wizards, whether of science or magic, could ever hope to imagine.</p>\n<p><strong>The beauty of this strange Viral time is that it is clearly showing the difference between these two.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-maccabean-test\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Maccabean Test <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/change/#the-maccabean-test\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We are standing told that in order to continue to live our lives normally, we will need to kiss the ass of the statue of the pig that they have placed in our temples. Is not the &quot;virus&quot; that keeps us from gathering in our temples, and the vaccination that will allow us, the same thing? It is not the virus that is preventing the communal prayer, but the rules of our society that are not allowing us to gather there as they say there is a virus that prevents us. That is the pig they have created and placed there. Now, in taking the virus, you are kissing the statue - you are agreeing, nay willing, your body to act in accordance with the wishes of this new rule. And in doing so, are accepting their mandated behaviour. For to need accept it, is tantamount to revolution. And the punishment for such treason follows soon after. At first, no-one is forced. But once a critical mass is reached - they called it &quot;herd immunity&quot; - the balance will be upset, and they will have to become mandated, because if those who have submitted, believing that the new rule will improve their lot - which is the common mantra of those in power, or who wish to be in power - and it seldom improves the lot of this class, except that the chaos causes movement of certain segments, and when the dust has settled, the system will produce the same situation of the ruled and the rulers.

But, let those who write stories come up with the myths and legends that will feed us and calm us in the dark nights. What I speak of is the <strong>vision</strong>, that silent sound that cries and moans in the background, hidden half-hidden in the stillness between two waves on the ocean. That something that you struggle to understand that leads you along strange and often uncomfortable paths, and takes you into dark and challenging spaces. Often you too have sufferred trauma as a child - I mean. nowadays we talk of the very trauma of birth</p>\n<pre><code>though there is little popular talk of the emotional trauma of the solution to that - ripping the baby out of the mother's womb through a pre-birth incision in her belly through which the child now enters the world.

There may be a spiritual calculus which can be used to describe the interactions that is more descriptive. Just as mathematics challenged and made more coherent, a large portions of our interactions with the world around us, so this spiritual mathematics would do to challenge much of the flotsam that floats around the central lake.</p>\n<p>Mathematics does not posit a self as fundamental to being, just a sense of self. We, however, have a false sense of self by believing that any meaningful understanding of this self can be separate from the environment in which it was and is experiencing, as if we could be separate from the brain processing. I mean, we think in our native tongue... and how many different languages have humans already spoken that we know of - and how many more are there to come?</p>\n<p>---## Spiritual/Material</p>\n<p>We enmesh the spiritual in the material in a very human way. We hide our lies and deceptions in that hidden, imaginary space, as well as our beauty and love. But what if the consequences of what we do materially have, essentially, material consequences, and not the spiritual ones that we normally are concerned about. Let us first focus on the purely material consequences of our actions, before we delve in the hidden aspects - and that is what I think jurisprudence is expressing. However the judicial system that emerges is crafted by those in power, and thus becomes a tool for maintaining that power - if not in the beginning, but without a doubt emerges at some stage. It starts with revolution to gain freedom, and then the leaders of the revolution become the oppressors - just different faces.</p>\n<p>[NOTE: Revolution - from the world revolve. So a revolution does not mean inherent change, they are generally just face-lifts. Evolution speaks of inherent change in the way it was done. To quote a Sages: &quot;That the only form of evolution is to one in which you become better than your previous self&quot;.]</p>\n<p>Notice here, I do not say that they do not affect the spiritual realm, but perhaps not in the manner and due to the events as we believe. As the system is continuous, or recursive - in that the every event is based on a sequence of events that occurred so that the seminal event could manifest. One cannot have vision without an eye, and a &quot;brain&quot; or perceptor of some nature that can &quot;see&quot; the vision. In other words, it has both the mechanism/technology available to see, and the perceptive capability to perceive and cognite (in some meaningful fashion) what is being seen. The one is purely technical, or empirical, the other is uncertain. To the materialist, it is the chemicals, or microtubules, or some other physical measurable event that occurs... whereas to the imaginative, there seems to be another element involved that we cannot measure with our empirical measurements, and is uncertain as to where exactly it is situation (in the brain - or elsewhere) - this we realm of spirit, or soul.</p>\n<hr />\n",

It feels so ominous. I don’t know about you - I teach Torah for a living - but each year, I dread these days. I’m dreading sitting in synagogue for hours and hours, doing my best to pay attention, but mostly spacing out. The prayers are in Hebrew, but even in the English, there’s so much poetry, it’s difficult to understand, and relate to. I feel guilty about that. Guilty that these days are supposed to be really important, and more often than not, I don’t prepare, or don’t prepare well enough that I can understand and follow everything.</p>\n<p>Could it be that these days are so difficult to relate to because of all the guilt? <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> is known as the Day of Judgment; <em>Yom Kippur</em> as the Day of Repentance or Atonement. It’s like guilt-fest. Each year, we sit and remember about how horrible we’ve been, and we resolve never to be that way again... Except, how many of us really do, are even able to do, complete and utter repentance, walking away from our sins, never to repeat them?</p>\n<p>I’m supposed to feel guilty for my failures. I try to do <em>teshuvah</em>, repentence, but really I know I’m just gonna sin again, so I feel guilty that my <em>teshuvah</em> isn’t real <em>teshuvah</em>, and that kinda makes me not wanna do <em>teshuvah</em>, and then I feel guilty for that, I mean, it’s just one big, bad loop.</p>\n<p>What if I were to tell you that the words <em>Yom HaDin</em>, Judgment Day, never appear in the Torah?</p>\n<p>That’s it! Cancel shul! We’re going to Disneyland!</p>\n<p>No, not quite. The sages in the <em>mishnah</em> are the ones that teach us that <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> is Judgment Day. But what I want to suggest is that the reason why you can’t find Judgment Day in the Torah, is because judgment... isn’t the true essence of the day. And until we understand what <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> really is about, at its core, we’re not really ready to observe it with the right frame of mind.</p>\n<p>Let us explore deeper what <em>Rosh Ha'shanah</em> is really about, and how it might help us stand before G-d, and before ourselves, not feeling the harshness and the gloom of guilt, but truly celebrating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"segment-2\" tabindex=\"-1\">Segment 2 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Firstly we have to deal with this problem: The words <em>Yom HaDin</em>, or Judgment Day in English, don’t appear anywhere in the Torah. The Rabbis in the <em>Mishnah</em> call this day “Judgment Day,” and that’s how we got to all the laws and the customs and the prayers about Judgment Day. But still, that should give us pause. I mean, did the rabbis just make this stuff up? Where did <em>they</em> get this from?</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at what the Rabbis themselves say about this day and see if we can pick up any clues. Here's how the <em>Mishna</em> describes that judgment. On <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>, &quot;all the inhabitants of the earth pass before G-d&quot;, like “a flock of sheep.”</p>\n<pre><code>            וְכָל בָּאֵי עוֹלָם יַעַבְרוּן לְפָנֶיךָ כִּבְנֵי מָרוֹן כְּבַקָּרַת רוֹעֶה\n               עֶדְרוֹ מַעֲבִיר צֹאנוֹ תַּחַת שִׁבְטוֹ כֵּן תַּעֲבִיר וְתִסְפֹּר\n                              וְתִמְנֶה וְתִפְקֹד נֶפֶשׁ כָּל חָי\n                 וְתַחְתֹּךְ קִצְבָה לְכָל בְּרִיָּה וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם\n\n      As a shepherd herds his flock,\n      Causing his sheep to pass beneath his staff,\n      So do You cause to pass, count, and record,\n      Visiting the souls of all living,\n      Decreeing the length of their days,\n      Inscribing their judgment.\n</code></pre>\n<p>As it says in Psalm 33:15 - הַיֹּצֵ֣ר יַ֣חַד לִבָּ֑ם הַ֝מֵּבִ֗ין אֶל־כׇּל־מַעֲשֵׂיהֶֽם<br />\n- G-d, the One who forms all of our hearts, who understands all of our actions, examines our souls, looking at us closely, at who we are and what we have done with our gifts - like a shepherd counting His sheep. So it’s exactly what we have been told. The sages are describing G-d, kinda like the eye of Sauron, lidless, always watching, seeing all the sins and misdeeds, judging us for them.</p>\n<p>But that’s not all the sages say about Judgment Day. In fact, upon further study, we begin to see that they actually gave us a different notion of this day. It discusses what are the appropriate prayers to say on Judgment Day. Instead of telling us to be guilty and pray for mercy because: “the great lidless eye is watching, the shepherd’s gaze escapes no one, beg, beg for forgiveness!” The sages in the Talmud say something else. They suggest three basic themes of prayer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Praise</strong>: <em>Malchiyot</em> - Kingship<br />\nThese are verses that describe G-d’s kingship. <em>Imru lefanai malchiyot kedei shetamlichuni aleichem</em> - &quot;say before Me verses of praise so that you will crown G-d as king over yourselves&quot;.</li>\n<li><strong>Remember</strong>: <em>Zichronot</em> - Rememberance:<br />\nThese verses describe fond memories that G-d has of His Holy people of Israel. Say verses of memory - <em>Kedei sheya’aleh zichronchem lefanai l’tovah</em> - &quot;so that your memory should come up to Me in a good way&quot;.</li>\n<li><strong>Sing</strong>: <em>Shofrot</em> - from the <em>shofar</em>, the ram's horn, sound.<br />\nThese verses reference the <em>shofar</em>. In the words of the <em>Gemara</em>: &quot;<em>Ba’meh</em>, how will you be remembered? You will be remembered through <em>shofar</em>&quot;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All told, it’s a kind of mysterious three-fold formulation of the day. These three categories of verses end up being the center of gravity around which our prayers on <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> revolve, but why? What does <em>malchiyot</em>, <em>zichronot</em>, and <em>shofrot</em>, have to do with this larger idea of <em>Yom HaDin</em> - a day of judgment?</p>\n<p>Well, it seems, the prayers aren’t quite what we’d expect them to be when we consider Judgment Day. They seem to see something deeper about this day than simply weighing your deeds and confessing your crimes. Something that has to do with <em>malchiot</em>, <em>zichronot</em> and <em>shofrot</em>, Kingship, Memories, and the <em>shofar</em>. This is kinda nice, what kind of Judgment Day is it without guilt? And - if none of this is in the Torah - are they making all of this up?</p>\n<h2 id=\"segment-3\" tabindex=\"-1\">Segment 3 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Let’s take a look at what the Torah itself says, and see if it can give us more clarity on the essence of the day, and maybe help us see what the sages saw that made them understand <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>, our day of Judgment, as a day of kingship, memories, and <em>shofar</em>. In fact, that description does not reference the idea of a day of judgment at all, instead the Torah characterizes <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> with as a day of <em>Zichron Teruah</em> - a day to remember the sound of the <em>shofar</em>!</p>\n<p>What exactly does this mean? It seems to be hopelessly ambiguous, a day of remembering the cry of the <em>shofar</em>. But whatever it means it certainly doesn’t seem to be saying it’s a day of judgment. I mean if you wanted to say it was a day of judgment, just come out and say on the first day of <em>Tishrei</em>, that’s a <em>Yom HaDin</em> - a day of judgment during which G-d has these scales and weighs the lives of everybody. Instead it is <em>Yom Zichron Teruah</em> - a day of remembrance of the cry of the <em>shofar</em>, as if there was some event that we are supposed to remember involving a <em>shofar</em>.</p>\n<p>And, guess what? There actually was, and the Sages actually tell us exactly what event it was. Listen to the words that we say as part of our <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> prayers right before we actually declare the verses of <em>shofrot</em> - the verses during which the <em>shofar</em> speaks. Here’s the text: <em>Atah nigleita ba’anan kevodecha</em> - &quot;You, G-d, revealed Yourself in a cloud of glory&quot;; <em>Al am kodshecha</em> - &quot;to Your holy people&quot;; <em>L’daber imam</em> - &quot;to speak with them&quot;; <em>Min ha’shamayim hishmatam kolecha</em> - &quot;from the heavens You made Your voice heard&quot;; <em>V’nigleita aleihem b’arpelei tohar</em> - &quot;and You revealed Yourself to them in thick clouds of purity&quot;. And when it happened: <em>Gam ha’olam kulo chal mi’panecha</em> - &quot;the whole world trembled before Your Face&quot;; <em>B’higalotecha Malkeinu al Har Sinai</em> - &quot; when You, our King, revealed Yourself on Mount Sinai&quot;. Yes, that’s the event the Torah is talking about. <em>Zichron Teruah</em> - that is what we’re supposed to remember on <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>. It’s the memory event in which we first heard the cry of the <em>shofar</em> - the cry of the <em>shofar</em> that we all heard, way back at Sinai. If you read the text of revelation at Sinai you’ll find there was a <em>shofar</em> blast there. The sound of the <em>shofar</em> seems to be what the remembrance of this day is about.</p>\n<p>Let’s pause here for a second. If it’s really true that on <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> we’re supposed to remember the revelation at Sinai, so the Torah could have just named it <em>Yom Zichron Sinai</em> - a day of remembering Sinai - that would have been clear enough. However, for some reason, the Torah is emphasizing the <em>shofar</em> blast at Sinai as a key part of the experience of revelation. Which is strange, as most of us would say that the main aspect of Sinai is the Torah. Yet, <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> comes along and says, <em>Yom Zichron Teruah</em>. Which is actually saying that the way to remember Sinai, is when we<br />\nblow the <em>shofar</em> <em>Yom Zichron Teruah</em>, in essence, that the <em>shofar</em> blast is the way you should remember it forever. Why would that be? Why would the sound of the <em>shofar</em> at Sinai be so important?</p>\n<p>Well, this is revealed in the very first words of that paragraph we’ve been reading, <em>Atah Nigleita</em> - &quot;You revealed Yourself&quot;. Listen<br />\nto the sentence one more time. <em>Atah nigleita ba’anan kevodecha</em> - &quot;You revealed Yourself in a cloud&quot;. Strange, that’s an oxymoron. How could G-d have revealed Himself in a cloud? Clouds don't reveal, they conceal. Even later on in Deuteronomy when we talk about the Sinai experience, we talk about it in terms of <em>Choshech</em> - &quot;it was dark&quot;, <em>Anan</em> - &quot;it was a thick cloud&quot;, <em>Arafel</em> - &quot;you couldn’t see a thing&quot;. How disappointing! Here’s the greatest event in the history of our nation, a Divine Revelation shared by the community, and it’s obscured by clouds. It’s like the biggest anti-climax. So what’s going on? How come it was so cloudy? How come it was so dark?</p>\n<p>Actually that wasn’t coincidental. There was a reason for that. Later on in Deuteronomy, again talking about the Sinai experience, Moshe picks up on the fact that you couldn’t see anything. He tells the people, &quot;You didn’t see anything at Sinai&quot; - <em>U’temunah einchem ro’im</em> - there was no vision, there was no picture, nothing to see, <em>Zulati kol</em> - all there was, was sound. Eventually that sound coalesced into words, and you heard the Ten Commandments, but even before that you heard the <em>shofar</em>: <em>Kol shofar chazak me’od</em> - &quot;the voice of the <em>shofar</em> was very loud indeed&quot;. There weren’t any physical <em>shofars</em> that were blowing at Sinai, what you heard was a supernatural sound. The sound of the <em>shofar</em> was G-d communicating with you even before He spoke to you.</p>\n<p>Why was sound the medium through which we encountered G-d, not sight? If you and I could choose to encounter the Almighty with any one of our senses, we probably would choose sight. It’s the most certain way of perceiving something - &quot;I saw it with my own eyes. It's true!&quot; - and the way we would want to encounter G-d. But sorry folks, that’s not the way it works. You can’t see G-d. Because sight is a sense by which human beings directly encounter something. When you see <em>x</em> you perceive <em>x</em> directly. Fragile human beings can’t have that direct an experience with the Almighty in this world, they won’t survive. As G-d says to Moshe later: <em>Loh yirani adam v’chay</em> - &quot;A person cannot see Me and live&quot; through that experience. But you can hear Me, you can hear My Voice. When you hear something that comes from 'x', you don’t perceive 'x' directly. You hear an vibration that emanates from 'x', but hearing is still a genuine encounter. It’s the most direct encounter I can provide for you, G-d says, you can encounter Me through My voice, and live.</p>\n<p>Now every year we have <em>Yom Zichron Teruah</em> - a day of remembering the voice. When we hear the <em>shofar</em> it takes us back, it stirs something in our collective human souls. We know that voice. It was the moment we made contact. It’s the moment that changed everything for us. After that moment we could never be the same.</p>\n<p>That memory of the shofar, of that first encounter with G-d, that actually is the essence of <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>. I’d argue that if we aren’t relating to that, if we don’t remember that core encounter, we’re missing the essence of the day. <em>Yom HaDin</em>, <em>malchiyot</em>, <em>zichronot</em>, and <em>shofrot</em>. They are all expressions of that primal encounter with G-d, of the day we first met Him and heard His voice. That’s a very different <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> than the one many of us are used to, but I believe it’s the one the Sages intended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"segment-4\" tabindex=\"-1\">Segment 4 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-4\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We have discussed about the real essence of Rosh HaShanah - the memory of our first encounter with G-d, at Sinai. Now we’ll try and examine how the sages understanding of Judgment Day relates to the essence of <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> and the encounter with G-d. I guarantee your <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> will never be the same again. But we still need to answer that gnawing question we’ve had from the beginning: What about this Day of Judgment thing that the Sages talk about, that seems totally unrelated to <em>zichron teruah</em>, to hearing G-d’s voice at Sinai. Where do they get that from?</p>\n<p>I don’t think the sages got it wrong. <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> is judgment day, just, not in the ways we always thought. I want to suggest that the sages knew that the essence of this day is <em>Zichron Teruah</em>, a day where we remember that close encounter with G-d. But the sages see expressions of that essence as a day of judgment, and as a day that is worthy of declaring G-d’s kingship, a day of memories, and shofar. Let me show you what I mean.</p>\n<p>Put yourself in the shoes of the nation at the moments leading up to Sinai. Imagine hearing G-d’s voice sounding something like a <em>shofar</em>, getting louder and louder. You’re trembling, hearing, and feeling, even seeing - the Torah describes this as total sensory overload, so that they were seeing His voice and not only hearing it. If you encounter G-d, what would that event have meant to you? How would you have processed it, rationally, and emotionally?</p>\n<p>The sages give us a guide: <em>malchiyot</em>, <em>zichronot</em> and <em>shofrot</em>.</p>\n<p>When we first heard G-d’s voice, in that instance... you know that there IS G-d. Not just that He exists - I think the generation that went through miracles in Egypt and the splitting of the sea, they knew He existed. But also that there is no denying that knowledge when you encounter G-d directly. At that moment, as we stood in front of G-d, we knew, He is our Lord and our Master, He is our leader, our G-d. This is how <em>malchiyot</em>, at least, is just one expression of The Sinai event.</p>\n<p>The Sinai event, the revelation event, what was that really about? One way of thinking about it is that day was the day that we recognized G-d as King. It was, in a word, coronation day. The Torah itself seems to call it that. G-d proposes to Israel this grand bargain at Sinai: <em>Atem tiheyu li mamlechet Kohanim</em> - you’re going to be a nation/community of priests. No such thing as a community without people, and priests without a Divine Source.</p>\n<p>// <em>A kingdom is a community ruled by a king. A community with a leader is not a kingdom - it is just a functioning community. The kingdom flourishes or descends according to the whims of the king. A community rises or sinks according to the efforts of the leader AND the community. Fascism, and dictatorships, are just kingdoms under a different nomenclature. That is the problem I have with these appelations of king and royalty. It brings in images of gold and jewels, grand castles and produce grand egos, and embedded power structures. We have to find a new language to express this relationship with G-d. I would not call G-d a leader either - that is what Moshe Rabeinu was, He is more, much more, than a leader, or a king. Perhaps it is sufficient to say simply that He is our G-d, and we accept Him as That, Ha'Shem, creater of the Universe, Source of all existence.</em> //</p>\n<p>To accept G-d (as king) is really to accept Him as our Leader. // <em>leader - as the one who guides us along His Path. Difference from the modern spirituality which is to ask G-d for help to follow &quot;my own true path&quot; - not realising that your only true path is His Path.</em> // It is to make a commitment to follow His Voice, to let Him lead you, and that, of course, was the Sinai experience. We accepted the Torah from G-d, which contained the directives of the Master of the Universe. Our acceptance of these laws indicated our willingness to follow Him, as we considered those laws binding.</p>\n<p>Every year when we remember that day, when we remember that sound on <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>, we crown G-d anew. It’s a day to declare anew our oath, our binding. We’re just re-enacting what that first moment of meeting.</p>\n<p>We’ve explored <em>malchiyot</em>. What about <em>zichronot</em>, <em>shofrot</em> and Judgment Day? How are they expressions of the essence of <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> - of that Divine encounter with G-d?</p>\n<h2 id=\"segment-5\" tabindex=\"-1\">Segment 5 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-5\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We suggested that <em>malchiyot</em>, declaring G-d’s kingship, is an expression of the idea that we are remembering Sinai. When we hear G-d’s voice, we know He is All-powerful, and thus we tremble in awe as if to royalty. However, this is no mere king, it is the King of the Universe. Could it be that <em>zichronot</em>, <em>shofrot</em> and <em>Yom HaDin</em> are also a reaction to hearing G-d’s voice? Let’s start with <em>zichronot</em> - memories:</p>\n<p>What role does memory play in <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>? Does that too take us back to the Sinai experience somehow? Go back to Sinai - really consider that experience. We talked about that experience from the perspective of accepting G-d’s leadership. But, as wonderful as accepting the Torah is, as wonderful as accepting G-d’s kingship is, that event can also provoke a crisis.</p>\n<p>You see, you and I, the average, everyday Joe or Jane, who doesn’t experience revelation, live what one might call normal lives. I’m doing my own thing. I was born in San Francisco and then I moved to New York when I was a teenager... I can tell you the whole story of my life, what I’m trying to achieve, what I’m trying to do. I have my story.</p>\n<p>But imagine what happens if Joe or Jane experiences revelation at Sinai. The Being who originated the universe is right here and you are standing around the mountain. It changes everything. Who am I anymore? I am so small in the face of the Master’s immensity. I am so overwhelmed that I am in danger of losing my entire sense of self. What does my little story matter anymore? What significance does it have that I moved to New York when I was thirteen and a half?</p>\n<p>That is the crisis. But if <em>malchiyot</em> provokes that crisis it also contains the seeds of an answer to it and those seeds are known as <em>zichronot</em> - the notion of G-d’s memories <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/:/akashic.org\">Akashic Records</a>. Let us explore the idea of memory. What does memory do? What exactly is its function? Well, obviously, memory helps you remember. But memory does far more than that. It’s actually the way we grasp who we are. Our identity itself, the way we understand ourselves, is formed through our memories - the reason being that memory is really about storytelling, about creating a narrative. When you remember things you’re actually connecting the dots between your various experiences, weaving them together to form a tapestry - your story. That’s actually the only way you do remember anything.</p>\n<p>If you think about it, that means that some points in my life are going to be more important to the story than others. Let’s say I’m a big, fancy investment banker. As I’m rushing out the door to work one morning, on the way out, my seven-year-old daughter spills orange juice on the floor and I need to clean it up before I go to work. That might have been what actually happened, but in the way that I talk to myself about my life, you know it’s a rather disconnected dot, it doesn’t really contribute to the grand story of my life - at least the way I see it. However, the birth of my first child will be a well-connected dot that will contribute greatly to the grand narrative of my life.</p>\n<p>Here, now, there’s another way to think about the crisis of <em>malchiyot</em> that we talked about before. If there really is a King in this universe, maybe there’s a grander story than the one I’m telling myself? Maybe the Creator has a story too?</p>\n<p>You think your life is about your story, and from your perspective when your daughter spilled orange juice that wasn’t a big deal, it was a disconnected dot. But maybe the Creator in His story, maybe He doesn’t think so? Maybe when you stopped and you patiently cleaned up that mess and smiled to your daughter, maybe that was a really meaningful dot? Maybe everything needs to be seen as how it connects to that dot? Maybe your life in the Creater’s view is not just about what a good hedge fund manager you are but how well you balance your career and family? Because if there’s a Creator there is a grand soundtrack out there. There’s a story being told in this universe, and it’s so much larger than just you and me. There’s a grand weave of history and if you could be part of that weave in a meaningful way, if you and your whole life could be a dot that connects in some visceral, significant, redemptive way in the world, how can there be more meaning in life than that?</p>\n<p>We speak about <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> as the beginning of the <em>Yomim Noraim</em> - &quot;the Days of Awe&quot;. What is awe? We feel awe sometimes when we’re in the presence of something like the Grand Canyon, or when you sit on a grassy knoll looking up at the stars at night. But ask yourself, why do you feel awe? Is it just because you feel like you are small and this is big? I don’t think so. Then you would say, &quot;Okay, fine. So I’m small, and that’s big.&quot; The reason why you feel awe when you have those experiences is because you sense that there might just be a larger story here. And if there is, I have to figure out how I fit because I want to be a part of that larger story. Sure, if you don't want to you don’t have to - you can continue telling your own story, but at what price?</p>\n<p>For those of you who read Harry Potter, remember that moment when Harry is at Platform 9¾ and he’s trying to figure out where that train to Hogwarts is. So he’s asking around and he asks somebody, a guy by the name of Joe, and Joe doesn’t know. He says, &quot;I’ve no idea. I’ve never seen Platform 9¾ before&quot;. Imagine you’re Joe. You have your life. You’re doing your own thing, but one day you figure out you’re part of J. K. Rowling’s novel. There’s a creator here and there’s a grand epic story. It’s Harry Potter, and he just bumped into you and asked which way the train was?</p>\n<p>Now in that moment of revelation - revelation itself - when you see the Creator and you realize there’s a grand story here - the Sinai moment as it were - what do you want most deeply? It’s like you could petition the author and ask, &quot;Could I have a more significant role in this story? I don’t want to just be the guy who got bumped into to ask where the train is. How can I help? How can you take my life, my personality, my gifts, my track record, what I’ve done, and weave me into that story?&quot;</p>\n<p>So yes, on the one hand, the Sinai moment, the encounter with the Kingship, implies <em>Din</em> - judgment. You’re going to look at my life. You’re going to examine who I am. You’re going to look at my record, what have I done, how I can contribute. But that is a glorious thing that judgment. It’s not judgment in order to be punitive and decide what terrible things you deserve to be subjected to in orderto be paid back for all your sins. No. This judgment is a marvelous opportunity. It’s my opportunity to be a part of the grand unfolding story.</p>\n<p>Count me in.</p>\n<p>// <em>The grander the narrative, the greater the challenges, thus the greater the trials and risks.</em></p>\n<p>It’s incredible to think of judgment as an expression of our original closeness with G-d. It’s a thought that gives us great hope. A place that we can leave the guilt of <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> behind, but also approach <em>Yom HaDin</em> with a certain kind of reverence and even joy... It’s an idea that promises to transform how we stand before G-d on <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"segment-6\" tabindex=\"-1\">Segment 6 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-6\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Over and over, we’ve asked where the sages got the idea of <em>Yom HaDin</em> from and how it relates to Sinai and now, I think the answer is finally clear: <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> is all about closeness with G-d. <em>Zichron Teruah</em>, the memory of Sinai, is really about waking up to the fact that G-d is our Master, our Leader, and so we spend time during <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> recognizing G-d’s mastery. But the memory of that encounter also fills us with awe and creates a crisis - G-d is the memory-keeper for all humanity. He is the great storyteller in the sky. How do I fit into His story?</p>\n<p>// <em>On this plane, it is like working for a year at a company, and doing a &quot;performance review&quot;. Did you achieve your goals set out in the previous review? That is how we mark it here - in the world of measurement.</em></p>\n<p>However, <em>Yom HaDin</em> is the adult version, and more like, after a year of work at your company, filing documents, landing clients, pursuing marketing campaigns - whatever it is you do at your business - you take a day out each year to look at the corporate mission statement. How do my action align with the corporate goals? It states here we’re pursuing growth, profit - did I make money this year? Great. Check. Let me keep reading... pursue growth while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Hm, how’d I do there? Well, I missed all of my kid’s soccer games. I haven’t been connected with my wife lately. I need to change something!</p>\n<p>The adult version of <em>Yom HaDin</em> isn’t the court case of G-d vs. Rivka Stern, “haul in the scales of sins vs. merits!” - it’s <strong>WHO AM I</strong>? What does G-d want of me? What is my true mission statement? How do I align with that? What is G-d’s story, and what’s my story? Do they align?</p>\n<p>Is there guilt involved? Yeah, sure. But we’re not meant to worship that guilt. It’s not a blessing to fill yourself up with self-loathing, and the more you hate yourself, the better <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> you will have. If you do that, you’re missing the point. It’s about the encounter with G-d. It’s about closeness. It’s about a relationship. Life is complicated. We have families, we have work, we pursue leisure. Sometimes we forget that G-d wants us to live that life with Him, not around Him.</p>\n<p>How are our businesses a part of G-d’s story? How are our families a part of G-d’s story? The simple things that we enjoy - how can we enjoy them together with G-d, as part of our relationship with Him. That’s <em>Yom HaDin</em>. That’s a day of Zichron Teruah.</p>\n<p>Take a look at that teaching again, the one that is the source for <em>Yom HaDin</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> all the inhabitants of the earth pass before G-d like “a flock of sheep.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do you see the difference now? G-d’s judgment isn’t the great lidless eye of Sauron waiting for you to fail. It’s that of the loving shepherd, who, honestly has a lotta sheep, but is taking the time to tend to each one and making each one of us feel special - making our stories matter. And remember, the Rabbis gave us a verse to support this conception of Din, it was a verse from Psalms, <code>הַיֹּצֵ֣ר יַ֣חַד לִבָּ֑ם הַ֝מֵּבִ֗ין אֶל־כׇּל־מַעֲשֵׂיהֶֽם</code> - &quot;G-d, the One who forms all of their hearts, who understands all of their actions&quot;.</p>\n<p>He’s not probing our thoughts and our hearts to find our misdeeds. Consider the difference between a judge in a courtroom, and our Judge the Creator. When a person judges you, they don’t know your full story. They don’t know your desires, your passions, your struggles in life, what led you to the moment of “failure”. They judge you on an objective scale, that frankly, isn’t fair. But The Creator? He formed our hearts, He understands the true nature of all of our deeds. He judges us subjectively, and that’s a good thing. That is the judgment of <em>Avinu Malkeinu</em>, our merciful and loving Father and the all-knowing, all-seeing leader.</p>\n<p>I don’t know about you, but this conception of <em>Yom HaDin</em> is a very different one than the one I grew up with. So we’re going to spend some time together trying to fuse the <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> we experience every year with this deeper <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> that celebrates our encounter with G-d.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If this notion of Rosh HaShanah as commemorating Sinai feels too foreign for you and you’re looking for just a little more evidence, I recommend you check out this video of the only recorded Rosh HaShanah celebration in the Torah, and the echos of Sinai you’ll see there. I really recommend it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"segment-7\" tabindex=\"-1\">Segment 7 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-7\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Up until now we’ve talked about a bit of a paradigm shift from <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> as a scary guilt-fest into something more mature, the memories of that Divine encounter at Sinai, and how those memories produce a sort of <em>Yom HaDin</em>, causing us to take stock of who we are vis-a-vis G-d, and to do some re-aligning.</p>\n<p>But that’s only part of the story. <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> is also, essentially, a celebration. It’s a holiday, remember? We’re feasting, we’re partying. It’s not just the solemn task of mission statements, there’s something to be enjoyed about, and I don’t want us to forget it. Remember, the fundamental idea of <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> is remembering that primal encounter with G-d. That relationship itself is worth celebrating. It’s coronation day, remember? We make G-d Lord over us because we’re utterly dumbfounded that the Master of all the Universe should care about us. That the Master Storyteller should weave us, US, into His story!</p>\n<p>Consider what that means. If G-d is the great storyteller in the sky, He is shaping the future, determining, yeah, the basic things like health, security, the plight of the sick, the destitute. He is deciding whether the things we pour our lives into should succeed: our careers, our relationships, our dreams. When we pray to G-d, the memorykeeper, the storyteller, we beseech Him to shape our story for good. That’s what so much of our prayer on <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> is doing.</p>\n<p>The Sages tell us how to pray on <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> - through <em>malchiyot</em>, <em>zichronot</em>, and <em>shofrot</em>. Let’s revisit those prayers one more time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>malchiyot</em> - say before Me verses of kingship so that you will crown G-d as king over you.</li>\n<li><em>zichronot</em> - say verses of memory; remind me of your shared story, remind me of your merits <em>Kedei sheya’aleh zichronchem lefanai l’tovah</em> - &quot;so<br />\nthat your memory should come up to Me in a good way&quot;. So that G-d will incorporate us into His story. The Talmud continues - <em>Ba’meh?</em> - how will G-d remember us? Through the <em>shofar</em>!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The shofar has a double meaning for us on this day. On the one hand, we use it to remember G-d’s voice. When we’re in shul on <em>Rosh HaShanah</em>, and we hear the <em>shofar</em> being blown, we are transported back to the primal voice. Remember it, and remember all of its implications.</p>\n<p>But the sages have us pick up the shofar, not just to remember G-d, but to have Him remember us too. G-d chose to communicate with us wordlessly, at first. So we could just hear His voice and know him. We do the same. We blow our shofar, back to G-d. It is our wordless prayer, a desire to fuse our <em>kol</em> with his <em>kol</em>, the perfect union - to join our voices with His voice, to join our story with His story. And in the end, to join our souls with His.</p>\n<p>When the shofar blows, forget the words to your prayers. What do you want? <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> is a day of celebration because it celebrates our relationship with G-d. It reminds us that He cares about us enough to hear our voice, to hear our desires, our hopes, our prayers, and to weave them into His story. I don’t know about you, but I think that’s remarkable, it’s awe-inspiring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"segment-8\" tabindex=\"-1\">Segment 8 <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-8\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We now have a transformed vision of Rosh HaShanah - a day of connection with G-d. But, how can we make these ideas practical?

We are the receivers, and now we come to deliver our message. It matters not to us whether you hear us and act accordingly or not. For we will continue, as the when we have nothing to receive and our awaiting our next task, we watch, and thus are known as the <em>Neshemot</em> or Watchers. For many centuries much of our knowledge was hidden, and transmitted in secret to a select few. As it is said, &quot;Speak of the Secrets to one who is learned in all the texts, but never reveal to two&quot;. With the advent of the written word, and much of the knowledge was written down, as the principle of Truth reigns supreme, and both can never lie. Thus the truth will always hide in plain sight. So it was with the messengers of the <em>Mekubalim</em>, and those who had been trained to read the codes, knew how the disguises were formed, and how to navigate the pathways that our people had placed for us. Thus we could recognise one another just by the way a certain phrase was uttered, or a sentence interpreted. It was like the dancing bears, or the &quot;four-twenty friendly&quot; of the Grateful Dead entourage. During this time, and in various guises our wisdom permeated various cultures, and geographical areas, and laid seeds that would sprout when the environment was conducive to its emergence. Again and again we have called to you. Sometimes in small groups, sometimes in nation states comprising hundreds of millions of people. In this time, and in this place, we begin to transmit once again.</p>\n<p>In the beginning it will be brief expose's. According to your reaction, and to your ability to comprehend what is being said, the appropriate doors will open.</p>\n<p>There is one more thing. There are two aspects to this check-up. The first is the empirical the second in the imaginative.</p>\n<p>We are not healers. There are those who are called to heal, sometimes they are doctors, sometimes they are medicine people. There are those who are teachers, or community leaders. We are not any of those. We are keepers of the Tree of Life. For without the Tree, there is no life.</p>\n<p>As we know there are 3 trees in the garden. [Actually four, but the 4th is a secret tree, and because it is secret, we will no longer speak of it]. The Tree of Life, and the Tree of Death, and the Tree of Knowledge (of Good &amp; Evil). And what is evil to the being conscious of being alive? It's death or anything associated with that, of course. Therefore there are those who work for the Tree of Life, and those who work for the Tree of Death. And the two are eternal enemies. We simply say, that good is to emulate G!d, and evil is to turn one's back on the Divine expression that not only are we surrounded by, but are also a part of.</p>\n<pre><code>Personal Question: If we are G-d's psyche having a Divine experience, what is G-d's need for all this pain and suffering? What does He get from all of this insane hurting of one another?\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n",

I was walking home one day, when a group of young guys dragged me into a shed and abused me, both sexually and emotionally. It was a terrible experience, but yet, in that awesome place of helplessness and terror, there was a gift.</p>\n<p>This is my story.</p>\n<p>There was a point at which I could not longer fight, and had to just submit to survive. At that point, it was like I had left my body, though not completely, because I could still feel, and hear everything that was happening. There was a part of me that was watching, and another that was - how can I say - enjoying it. Even feeding off the energy of the situation - as bizarre as that may seem.</p>\n<p>I realised then, and have confirmed since, that many, many women (and men) suffer from the - the only word I can use here is juicy - feeling that arises. It is like a feeling of something being nourished. This is where the essential existential issue around sexual activity arises. The assumption/belief is that that which is being nourished is evil, or bad,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it evil? It is one of, if not the primal, source of life (and its experience).<br />\nPerhaps one needs to journey to that place, and speak to it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and thus needs to be repressed...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is an energy. Modern man can think of electricity, primitive man can think of fire, and some can see it in water. But, like all energy it needs to be constrained to be useful, else it will become destructive. We also find that repressed energy will eventually erupt violently. Energy must also be moderated so that the recipient can handle it, and does not &quot;fuse&quot;, or get burnt to ashes, or drown in the tsunami. In fact, it has to be carefully modulated so that it feeds the appropriate amount in the right sequence at the correct time to the receiver.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and all this is based on religious doctrine. This is where my the experience turned me, or turned some light on, and I could see something I never saw before. There are religious truths, which are based on a narrative to explain the world we live in, and try and forge ways of living in it in community. And there are spiritual truths, which are based on Truth.</p>\n<p>For example, my story is based on the fact that I was brutally raped at 15.. and then my subsequent life was built around this seminal fact - upon which my particular story is based. That is the &quot;religious/cultural&quot; context. It was terrible. I was bruised and sore for weeks after. The emotional scars were deep and affected my relationships for the rest of my life. And what did I do to deserve it? I was an innocent girl, and suddenly the evil wolves jumped from between the buildings and attacked me. What G-d, may His Name be raised high, would create this, I have asked, over and over, again? I know many have had similar terrible experiences, some even far worse than what happened to me. But this was my experience, my particular event. I have to own it in some way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A basic assumption of human existence is that my life began when I was born. This is ungoldy. Because it ignores the incredible confluence of events that had to gel to make your birth possible. That my awareness of my own life begins when I was born, ignores all the lines that came together to produce this particular minute event in the macrocosm of our universe alone, let's not take into consideration the whole of creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because we have a limited view of the totality, we can only see through the window that is availabe to us. If we see trees through the window, we assume that there are trees everywhere, and you see trees when you look through your window. And not only do you see trees, but the natural egoistical assumption is that you see the same trees as me. But from your tower, the landscape might be different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a meditation on <em>Netzach</em> &amp; <em>Hod</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would be easy to hide behind a denial - and say well G-d, the all-merciful, the all-seeing un-seen, does not exist. Throw the baby out with the bathwater. But there were elements that were present in that event that were filled with awesome - what? Things that occurred that were not of this world, but felt like they occurred in another... dimension? Could that be. I wanted to say another realm - but that is not accurate. It was a realm that is attached to, is of, this realm, but yet not of it. My body was experiencing the reality of what was happening to it, and I was feeling it, like I was there - but yet, here I was, watching it happen too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Christians base their religion on the fact that Jesus, the Son of G-d, blessed be His Name, lived and died for our sins. Moslems base it on the fact the Mohammed is a prophet of G-d, may His Name be blessed, Much of the rest is to contextualise the narrative. Jews base their religion on the fact that G-d, may His Name be on my lips for evermore, gave the Jews the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At some point someone told a story, and enough people believed his story - and a religion is born. The only difference that the Jews claim is that theirs was a communial revelation. The Eastern faiths seems to have permeated more subtly into the people's mind. But, not being an expert in neither their cultural history nor their faiths, I hesitate to speak to much of them in this context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Through the years, I have realised that there are many others of us who have had a seminal event (some a series thereof) that has shaped their lives. It is like we are born a block, almost like piece of clay, that is then shaped by the hand of G-d, may I never forget Your Name, or for some Nature, or Chance, or &quot;Some Thing Else&quot;. But it was not any of us, collectively or separately, that we know! So whatever put me together, before I was raped, is not of this that I know, whatever name I might give it, or not. Perhaps the DNA is that map, just as every seed contains the map for its particular type of tree. Then the elements and environment shape it in according to the particular set of events that it experiences. We see this in the rings of ancient trees that have been cut [and cut and cut, until there will be no ancient trees left].</p>\n<p>This horrible event shaped me in the same way. I have seen these twist people into really ugly shapes and I pity them. But I do cannot truly judge them. I can only make sure that it has not twisted me into a pretzel version of myself.</p>\n<hr />\n",

Because, in actual fact, it is a movement - though it is not a horizontal movement, as moving from one home to another - but one could almost think of it as a vertical movement - though that too is not accurate. I would like to express it, and hope that it is, a dimensional move. In essence, it may be expressed as the movement into another dimension. Though that is not 100% accurate. It is the inclusion of the awareness of another dimension, and acknowledgement of those who are able to work with and in that dimension. Listen to them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"types\" tabindex=\"-1\">Types <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/the_movement/#types\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There are 2 types of people who joined the movement.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Those who were playing out their childhood traumas</em> - as this space allowed for a wider playing field in which to express these traumas.</p>\n<p>This is a natural result of a society becoming more successful and thus more affluent. It allows the inheritors of this affluence a greater sphere of activity, and thus inevitably foster expressions that are challenging to the fabric of the society, and eventually the very fundamental principles upon which it is based.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Those who wished to build a society based on a different, a new narrative</em>. It was if they had heard something, and were awakened to a vision.</p>\n<p>None were sure what it was - they just new what it &quot;felt&quot; like, or what they dreamed it could feel like. Many of them went in search of this &quot;feeling&quot;. Some went to the plants to see if they could teach them, some went to the sacred texts and sought answers, some joined cults religious, or otherwise, believing that community was the solution - but it is also the problem. Many believed that the Mother, the earth that nourishes us all, would have the answer - but against the deadly onslaught on everything living that is we are a part of, it is unlikely that there will be any earth left to teach us. We will have turned all the forests into commercial plots by then.</p>\n<p>We sat in circles and talked about the vision of the New Earth, and we tried to build communities based on these New Principles, but we inevitably fell back into the patterns we were familiar with, and in all these efforts we saw the same dynamics play itself out - and these were the same dynamics that happened in all groups, whether religious or not, commercial or social.</p>\n<p><strong>The Game has to change</strong>. With the same volcanic effect that the theories of quantum dynamics had on classical physics. [Perhaps the very term Quantum Physics is an anachronism, like Real TV. Perhaps this &quot;Quantum Physics&quot; is not physics at all, as everything it talks about is non-physical actually. Yet it does a good job of &quot;proving&quot; its reality. In the same way, if the Shaman could produce results that could be emperically measured (according to the accepted, standard measurments - those measurements that are acceptable to the accepted rules of measurement. This is the same as the impact of a new legal system on indigenous people - which needs always to be backed up by military power) who now have to accept new measurements of social behaviour imposed by the ruling class (which is what actually makes them the &quot;ruling class&quot; - not any inherint human characteristics. Which is why we have more popular respect for the successful entrepeneur, rather than the privileged noblesse. We look at them with the fascinated stare of the mouse watching the snake as it slithers towards it, hoping that it will strike the mouse frozen beside it. We know that these people have the ability to destroy our lives in a moment if they so wish. We fight to hold back their desire to control everyone and everything. But we must remember that they are just scared of the Divine nature of the universe and themselves - which is the last thing they will be able to acknowledge, having spent their entire existence catering to the emperical (measurable according to standard accepted measurements) human nature of their being. And this is an attempt to build walls around the terror of extinction, of not being anymore, forgotten in the ashes of time. So they need to build huge edifices to their greatness, pyramid and towers. They have to fight great wars and accomplish grandiouse (and often idiotic) things - to impress everyone, and everyone can applaud their greatness.</p>\n<p>But I ask you O great ones who rule over us and wish to control us like ants, like little slaves to do their bidding, and feed their petty, mostly material, desires with our juices - how large is your pyramid next to the giant nebula that gaze upon us in pity? If you are remembered for a 1000 years, O my Emperor, how long is that in the eyes of our very planet, which your science says has been here for 15,000,000,000 years? Well, I say, however, or whatever built this planet, is going to be remembered for far longer than any one of you will be. And is capable of producing things far greater than any of you, or your wizards, whether of science or magic, could ever hope to imagine.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The beauty of this strange Viral time is that it is clearly showing the difference between these two.</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"the-call\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Call <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/the_movement/#the-call\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h1>\n<p>Hogsback -</p>\n",

His ability to think in global terms, analysing many of the large scale issues that need to be dealt with, is commendable.

However I question his uncompromising support for a form of World Government based upon the current political and economic framework. The Government could turn out to be even more distant from the average person, the citizens. It could become another form of the present government, only perhaps larger and more bureaucratic and politicized, and even more unaccountable. How tedious the process of change or agreement or action would be? How distant, how unaccountable would that body be in the end, to the average person. And once set in motion, how incredibly difficult it would be to change any direction.</em></p>\n<p><em>NOTE: The other point is that in order to have a world government we would need a global community that required and participated and supported and interfaced with it.

To unpack this statement more fully, will take a certain amount of training in the language. Hopefully <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/4d-vision/dimensions.html\">these explanations</a> will help. You can of course just <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/....\">google</a> it.</p>\n<p>Let me explain from a more humanistic level. We live in a world that we call 3 dimensional. A world that has length, breadth and depth/height.</p>\n<pre><code>It is interesting to note that perspective. We have only length - short or long. We could say shortness instead, and do sometimes, but shortness means a very brief length. We never think of long as a very long shortness. Also in its very grammer one can see a difference. Length is a state of something, whereas shortness is a description of a state of something, length is the the measurement of something, and is often called distance - which just clarifies the equivalent adjectival use of long and short. Similarly with breadth and her twin width - which is identical to the constellation of length, and had wide (though not wideness). Though breadth could be looked at as derivative or secondary, as breadth does imply some measurable distance, though distance does not necessarily imply any measurable breadth. Finally, we have depth, which is makes it clear that this is from the perspective of a point or plane of origin, for it implies an above and below.\n\nBefore delving into that, let me note that both length and breadth also contain points of origin by implication, something which is not obvious upon speaking of length. Let me explain. Length is easy. It implies a beginning and an end point (and by implication a midpoint - all the rest are debatable). The beginning (or any other point on the line) could be taken as the point of origin. Though, we normally speak of the distance between two points as being the length. I could now speak of breadth in the same manner, but I wish to take you on a slightly different path. Though breadth/width is often thought of in linear terms, i.e. the width of the tunnel, or the breadth of his reach, it is actually more representative of a circle, and thus it becomes actually &quot;the midpoint of the linear measurement of the width of the channel is the &quot;moving point of the center of the circle that is defined by the breadth of the midpoint upon which it moves&quot;. If this channel is uniform, as a highway, then one can measure the breadth by measuring the radius of the circle that is bounded by the width of the road, and you will have your breadth, and your point of origin. One speaks of the average width of a river, that it is narrow at some places and broad at others. But with depth, there is always a height, a dynamic, an up or a down!\n</code></pre>\n<p>We call it the world of measurement, though more often it is called the emperical world, or more scientificially: based on emperical evidence - which just means &quot;measurable&quot;, or more accurately, &quot;objectively&quot; measurable. In the beginning, we had our senses, and they consisted of 5 measuring instruments, our 5 senses. Interestingly enough, during that &quot;primitive&quot; (I prefer early) period, we also have records of other senses, which have been largely discredited in our modern era. But that is really <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/4d-vision/neshama.html\">another topic</a>. Even those five have been reduced to the three above dealing almost exclusively in identifiable objects and surfaces in our explorations of our surroundings.</p>\n<pre><code>with the demotion of smell, and taste (touch, which has been slowly removed, cannot be exclusively denied, as it is a constant of our existence, and is, in fact, one of our primal senses, together with smell and taste - all 3 of which have been largely superceded by the commercialisatory forces. Taste by sugar &amp; salt and other flavouring; smell by perfumes and deodorants (and now in foods too); touch with the synthetic materials that &quot;feel&quot; like the real thing, with sexual mores, and other such manipulable fashions\n</code></pre>\n",

All it will see are the bottom of your boots - from the side. In fact, if you take a step, it will be almost magic to him, for your boot will dissapear - if he is lucky, he will have a glimpse of the sole of your boot, and then reappear somewhere else, probably a decent distance away for him, but for you, it was just a step. Your voice will come from the &quot;heavens&quot; (G-d knows where that is!) - but somewhere &quot;above&quot; him - if he even has the concept of above, otherwise he will percieve it all around him. You kindly kneel down to show him yourself, but this wierd visage, something he could never recognise, let alone describe will suddenly appear close to him, perhaps as large as a mountain. As he has no depth perception or, for the sake of our story, very limited ability, he will only see a partial image of your visage. Something like those sculptures of a face emerging from a rock. I do not think it will assuage his terror at your appearance.</p>\n<p>3d's - to the 3d's you are like an ant, or worse, he might not even be able to perceive you, as he has limited 2d perception - though I propose his consciousness is 2d, though the reality that he live in is 3d. He needs to be trained to live from a 3d perspective and is not necessarily more effective than a 2d entity.</p>\n<p>Then above 3d, we encounter, or are &quot;under&quot; 4d, something we can only intuit, but not perceive - as we do not have 4d consciousness. But you have to remember something about consciousness - it is like a wave, and thus is an expression of energy, and energy is infinite in expression. That is, it can and will express itself anywhere. In other words, it will find and outlet, using whatever material is available to express itself. The only manifestation will be like the &quot;waves on the ocean&quot;, soundless but full of sensation/feeling.</p>\n<p><strong>Every sensation you feel, every thought you are conscious of, every heartbeat is an expression of the energy that permeates - nay, Is - the entire existence.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n",

But G-d wants that these things should exist only in order that man should reject them as contrary to His very; so theirs is an existence whose inner essence – those function and raison d'être – is not to exist.</p>\n<p>Let us use the metaphor of digestion to explain the phenomenon.</p>\n<p>Digestion is the process by which food passes through the various organs which break it down and separate its finer elements from its coarser ones. At each phase of the process, this separation grows more and more defined; ultimately, the finer elements in the food evolve into body-building cells and energy, and its coarser elements are ejected by the body. Both the nutrients and the waste are products of the digestion system; but the former is generated to be used, while the latter is generated to be rejected and thereby enable the body’s absorption of the former.</p>\n<p>By the same token, the Chain of Evolution is like the cosmic “digestive system” in which the essence of creation is processed into the substance and the energy of the universe that G-d desired. This process (like every process we know) also generates waste – elements that must be separated and disposed of in order for the desirable product to function.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_dis/#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\">[12]</a></sup></p>\n<p>(Of course, G-d could have evolved His world in such a manner that the good develops without any separation of waste, or, for that matter, He could have not evolved it at all. But G-d desired that the good in creation should be all the more sharply defined by its contrast with the rejected evil; that human life should be an exercise in refinement – in distinguishing between the calories of divine energy and the sludge of putrid waste in our own self and character, our environment and our world. Indeed, the very concept of good, as we know it, would be devoid of all meaning were it not for the challenge of rejecting the evil that vies for validation and indulgence.)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_dis/#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\">[13]</a></sup></p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_dis/#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\">[14]</a></sup>Based on the above, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, explains the following incident related in the Talmud:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_dis/#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\">[15]</a></sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, Rabbi Yehushua and Rabbi Akiva were walking along the road when they heard the sounds of the crowds of Rome in the distance.

Shall we not weep?”<br />\nSaid he to them: “That is why I am laughing. If for those who transgress His will it is so, how much more so is it for those who do His will.”<br />\n<em>(Talmud, Makkot 24a-b)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Akiva is saying: If the waste produced by the divine desire in creation can yield such pleasure for the hedonist, imagine the pleasure to be derived through the fulfilment of His will, which is the source of all pleasure!</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-the-fortieth-year\" tabindex=\"-1\">In the fortieth year <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_dis/#in-the-fortieth-year\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Therein lies the deeper significance of the idolatry (of <em>Peor</em>)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_dis/#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\">[16]</a></sup>, and the explanation of why the people succumbed to it on the eve of their entry into the Land of Israel.</p>\n<p>On the face of it, the idol worship (of <em>Peor</em>) was a particularly repulsive activity. In truth, however, this was but the physical encroachment of what a person does every time he prefers an unG-dly pleasure over a G-dly one: he is worshipping the offal of creation, venerating something whose only significance is its need to be rejected in favour of the energies that are extracted from it.</p>\n<p>This is why the vulnerability (to <em>Peor</em>) came about at the close of their forty-year sojourn in the desert, as they camped on the east bank of the Jordan River poised to enter and settle in the Land of Canaan.</p>\n<p>For forty-years, the people had enjoyed a wholly spiritual existence. They were fed, clothed and sheltered by daily miracles, leaving them free to pursue the divine wisdom of the Torah, without the distractions of the material state. Most telling of their state was the fact that the mann, the “bread from heaven” on which they lived, was wholly absorbed into their bodies, engendering no waste. They inhabited a spiritual idyll, in which the waste of creation was unknown.</p>\n<p>But now they stood at the threshold of a new era: they were about to settle the land, till its soil, engage in commerce and polotics – i.e., to live a physical life sustained by physical means. For the first time in their history as a nation, they were to be in direct contact with the nether levels of the Chain of Evolution – with that part of the cosmic digestive tract which separates the waste from the body of creation. For the first time, they were called upon to differentiate between vital matter – matter that nourishes a spiritual end – and dead matter – matter as an end in itself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_dis/#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\">[17]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Not all were equal to the challenge.

If the pleasure is not spiritual that you seek, it will then be attracted to and by objects that are on the same lower, denser, and more beastly level – what one would call the level of idolatry – which is to pray to idols – the lower, base manifestations of the divine!

Thus the end would be defined as the point furthest away from the source. Furthest in this sense would mean the most unlike the source. Something like the broken telephone. The further away from the source of the message, the more the message drifts from its original. Or if you imagined the light as the source, then it would be darkness on the other end. If it was life, then death would be the end.<br />\n(ii) But what we are talking about here is process or chain of evolution from the source of evolution itself. Thus it must evolve from something to something else – and the only place the unity, perfection can move to, is the opposite of everything that it is.<br />\n(iii) Thus this evolution becomes an evolution from the source to whatever the source is not, and thus it becomes unconducive to whatever radiates along this chain of evolution.<br />\n(iv) Thus if we name the Source, G-d, then the statement of whatever G-d desires, is inconclusive. Because this very chain of evolution is G-d’s desire. For nothing can exist without G-d wanting it to exist. Thus, it is not contrary to G-d’s desires, unless we interpret G-d’s desire to be what radiates from the Source, and thus as it gets further and further from the Source, it begins to contain less and less of it and thus is less able to conduct the “desire”.<br />\n(v) Remember, this is not spatial, although we have to use spacial constructs to explain it. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_dis/#fnref7\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn8\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>It is similar to the process of conductivity.

Thus in the usage of some archetypes, we use a word that is common to our culture. However, we do not wish to restrict it only to that context. If we speak of G-d, we think of G-d as both transcendent and immanent, as the One that is everything, everywhere and without whom nothing would exist. It could be Ha’Shem, Jehovah, the Holy Spirit, Allah, the Source, the Creator, Great Spirit, Buddha, Jesus, the Holy Prophet, blessed be His name, and the names of all the prophets. These all call to that infinite Being that cannot be named by any name, by is called by all names.</p>\n<p>If we refer to anything or anyone, include G-d, in a particular gender it is not to diminish any other. We could play the game of using She instead of He, or even It. But It is neither He nor She nor It. But we are restricted and constrained by the terms and manner of the language and its cultural norms. In English, we could use It. However, in Hebrew, there is no it – thus G-d is either He or She... and they chose He! Now we can turn all the He’s into She’s and then the gender problem will be solved....</p>\n<p>The debate over gender is only pertinent with the background of gender discrimination in a society. It has no intrinsic effect on that. Perhaps we have a bible that contains He and another version that uses She instead. The first is used by the men, and the second by the women. BTW, if that was done in the Hebrew bible, it would require the verbs to be changed to the feminine form in these cases too.</p>\n<p>I would rather seek to understand what we mean when we use He and what aspect of G-d are we expressing when we use the feminine pronoun. Let us explore deeper the feminine expression of G-d, and then only change those. We could possibly continue to use the masculine form of the verb, as is often done in modern Israel, with the feminine pronoun. I have to point out that there are many commentaries, some relying on the Gematria (numeration) of verses to derive certain conclusions. Many of these would no longer be relevant if we amended the text.

These webs are made up of affinity groups. This affinity can be on many different levels. It could be financial, it could be familial, it could be philosophical, cultural, or religious.</p>\n<p>Take your friends, for instance. The people you are close to, and whom you share parts of your life. They form an affinity group that you are part of. That group might be connected to another pod in a web that might consist of an organisation like a department in a university, or a project team that are part of a project that is occurring in a corporation, and so on outwards, further and further.<br />\nWe are all connected via these strands that connect us all, making the tapestry of our lives and the human race itself.</p>\n<p>If this is so, you might ask, then what is the element that we speak of that we would like to insert into this web within web that already exists? It is one of consciousness. Of becoming conscious of these interactions, and what is occurring.</p>\n<p>There are many articles that have been written about these webs since the WWW arose. They explore this concept that all organisational structures, structures that manifest a certain coherency, and thus are all networks of some form. Webs are networks, trees are networks, blood vessels are networks, lungs are networks, even forests consist of webs of interactions.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"our-journey\" tabindex=\"-1\">Our journey <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#our-journey\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Our journey begins on the inside, with the inner <strong>‘I’</strong>, consistent with the view that we need to manifest our spiritual aspect in the material realm of consensual reality, rather than the other way round. This requires us first to awaken and become more consciousness of the effect we are having on the world around us. Thus begins the hero’s journey into the inner reaches of your own self – what we call the first soul, the <em>Nefesh</em>. That <strong>‘I’</strong> that I am in the world around me. However that is not the cause, not the first cause, and you will begin to understand that as you head deeper into the reaches of your inner being. There you encounter both forgiveness and responsibility. That you have to take responsibility for your part in the things that have happened, and what is presently happening in your life – not the things you have no control over, but those that you do. Nevertheless, most certainly, you need to take full responsibility for your relationship with the “inevitable” events of your life.1 Those that seem to be part of your destiny. And believe me they are! For each one of us has a purpose, some big, some “small”, but just as it takes a village to make a village, so it will take the entire human population to fashion a global community.</p>\n<p>Then you need to forgive yourself for what you have done that was not true to your inner purpose and will – as in “Thy will be done, in heaven as on earth”. This is the place of the second soul – Ruach. That is when you enter the court and there encounter the breath of the Divine Creator, the one we call King. It is when you begin to experience awe and deep understanding of how it is all connected, and that we are all part of a purpose that is so beyond purpose that it leaves you breathless.</p>\n<p>What we need to understand, truly understand is that there is a template within which each one of us is born – we can even refer to as a Space – a space that has been granted each of us, and in this space we are “divine”. We have been granted the right to do with it what we wish. Pollute it, destroy it, allow others to violate it. In this realm, we call it our body – the material manifestation of this space. It consists of the skin, the barrier, that divides the inside from the outside. Yet it is some-where in this body, in this space, that our consciousness lives. Where is this place? Each of us is an version of this template, both inside and outside. Each one of us is formed from the same template, perhaps you can think of it as the same idea.</p>\n<p>This continues out and in, above and below, large and small. Each atom is made from a template, whose measurements and behaviour we think, are quite well described nowadays. The galaxies are formed in similar ways, and gravity is gravity, however you interact with it. But how accurate is our description or knowledge of what it actually is?2</p>\n<p>We, human beings, and all of life, in fact all of creation, exist within the constraints of this template. That we cannot change.3 But we can be whatever we wish within the spaces of this template – the space of which we are conscious. That is the place of choice.</p>\n<p>We eat to feed the body. Food cannot feed the soul. It is then our relationship with the food that will feed the soul. Our affinity to it. So it is with everything that we interact act with. If we have a “soul- full” relationship with it, then it feeds our soul. If not , then it goes to some other place... what that is we can speak of at another time, for that is not the topic under discussion, but that of creating the seeds of the web that I wish to speak of. These are the heart spaces from which these seeds will come.</p>\n<p>Commitment is to step into the physical reality that we live in. They define the lines, the limits, which form the foundations upon which our structures rely. Commitments used to be made with our word - we called them oaths and vows, when all a man had was his word. In fact creation begins with words “And He said... let there be light.”</p>\n<p>Once we have commitment, we can begin building the Tree of Life, from whose fruit new life will be seeded. If we make a commitment to connecting with others who believe that every relationship is sacred. A sacredness that comes from the awareness of the Oneness of everything, expressed in knowing that everything is connected. That everything you do has consequences, and nothing exists in a vacuum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sacred-communities.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sacred communities. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#sacred-communities.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>At the centre of the community, it core, so to speak will be a space, which is designated as the Temple, and it is dedicated to Truth. It also carries the creed of “peace before truth”. Speak only if necessary, maintaining essential silence. And if you speak, consider the effect of your words. But if you do speak, speak only the truth – or else pray instead for forgiveness and mercy.</p>\n<p>That is the centre, the pillar around which all will stand.</p>\n<p>In this sacred space, the deeper the truth spoken, the more we can know the person who speaks. In this way we create a communal space, within which to recognise the areas of positive resonance, and the work/service necessary to enable, support and encourage the manifestation of those areas in the lives of those affected.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of talk nowadays of the ideal way of life. There is a huge debate on what makes the ideal lifestyle.[^4] On the physical side, it might be to have lots of money, and a big house and a nice car and a lovely wife and good children.<br />\nOn the emotional side it is to have a loving family and caring supportive community. On the mental side, is to do something meaningful or challenging. On the spiritual side, it is to be honour, obey and serve the Divine, both within and without.[^5]</p>\n<p>With this plethora of information, many people are starting to ask difficult questions about the fruits of this way of life that we are in, or heading towards, realise that something needs to be done to change the direction we are heading in.</p>\n<p>We may be feeling totally overwhelmed, and disempowered. This is because there are still not enough of us. The “thoughts” have not yet reached critical mass. Similar to what nutritionists tell us. Even though we know we should not eat “bad” food, we still indulge, even over-indulge – until we encounter a health crises. That is the difference between knowing and doing. It is made up of “I can’t because ...” Let us stand up, all of us that believe in a different way of living, and relating to the earth, and begin to do it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"temple-meeting\" tabindex=\"-1\">Temple meeting <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#temple-meeting\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Start each meeting with an acknowledgement of Spirit in whichever way that is meaningful to all. In other words express the movement from the mundane to the Sacred, the passing through the Machsom, the barrier, that sits between the two. Like the skin, that separates, and thus both blocks and protects, the inner parts of your body from the outer.</p>\n<p>And end each gathering with a blessing of gratitude to those Spirits that gathered to help and protect and guide the gathering.</p>\n<p>We gather to talk of and plan actions in order to envisage, and collaborate in creating spaces and platforms that facilitate a more (w)holistic lifestyle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"start-with-the-food-and-water\" tabindex=\"-1\">Start with the food &amp; water <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#start-with-the-food-and-water\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Start with the food and the water. Reams has been said and written on this topic. From the nutritional to the spiritual, not ignoring the emotional nor the mental aspects of our food and the manner in which we absorb the nutrition and the effect it has upon us.</p>\n<p>This, in itself, will produce a change in everything. In order to obtain organic and free-range food, will require a change of lifestyle, it will feed those who have also embarked on a spiritual path. What we require from them is that they too will be part of the community or at least the web of communities.</p>\n<p>I will not even begin to speak of the effort that it might take to ensure that we all have good water to drink. Because at this stage most water that we drink is no longer free. In fact we have sunk so low, that we drink it out of plastic bottles in which they have been confined. I would suggest that we drink more cress water, and less adulterated water in the form of soda’s, or caffeinated drinks, etc. Once that has been achieved, then the hunt is on to find pure water, water that itself has been less adulterated by human interference than most of our tap water.</p>\n<p>Similar to the concept of <em>Kosher</em> or <em>Halaal</em>, where we restrict ourselves to “spiritually” acceptable food, and never indulge in food that is not “kosher”, that is firstly, physically harmful, and secondly spiritually inappropriate.</p>\n<p>If we focus on these aspect of our lives, these very practical and essential items, many things will begin to change right there. Even if you are practicing this, there is probably still some room for improvement – or for service. Helping others attain this; making it easier for each of us to obtain this food, etc, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"collaboration-not-competition\" tabindex=\"-1\">Collaboration, not competition <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#collaboration-not-competition\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Collaboration, not only competition, needs to be a basic principle of each of the communities. With this, we can begin to build cohesion. At least being in agreement of what it means in relation to the food that we eat and that we produce to be “honouring the earth and the creatures of the earth.”</p>\n<p>Though all of this might seem a far of dream and even idealistic too many.</p>\n<p>Let me get more prosaic, and call on pure common sense, of which it seems many are just lacking. It is not about wars, and weapons and pollution, etc, but on carrying out actions and supposing a lifestyle that is destructive to both yourself and your environment. It is very likely that much of what is making us sick is also toxic to our environment.</p>\n<p>I could ask the question why in the name of all that is holy would someone want to poison himself? Well there are a number of reasons, and even necessary reasons, though if deemed unnecessary, one would call it an addiction.</p>\n<p>I realise we are not perfect and we make mistakes, but it is not the mistake that is the issue, it is the not rectifying it, or trying to improve that becomes the sin, what we would call dishonorable behavior.</p>\n<p>Now, if there are pesticides, which are poisons, in my food, why would I eat that, if all things being equal, I had a choice? Now, there might be a percentage that could find it appealing and continue with the poisoned food, but that would only be a small percentage.</p>\n<p>Surely it makes sense to eat things that come from the earth, and are grown with the minimum of human inputs? Though this might vary from place to place, and thus different solutions might be appropriate for different circumstances, I still don't understand how economically it is cheaper to sell processed food rather than unprocessed?</p>\n<p>So this economic system obviously incentives the processing of food, and not the growing and distribution of unprocessed foodstuffs. I believe we have the capacity to change this, and we can only do it together, through an organised network of collaboraters.</p>\n",

But only if he experiences divine pleasure in its being,<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end1\" name=\"_top1\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[1]</sup></a> will he achieve the true fulfillmint of his desire, to touch its soul. However, the degree and intensity of this pleasure is governed by the object of desire’s place in the chain. The more spiritual the thing that is desired is, the more fulfilling will be the pleasure it yields – for it is closer to the source of all pleasure.<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end2\" name=\"_top2\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[2]</sup></a> The ultimate experience of pleasure lies in the experience of union with the Source, where pleasure resides in its most pristine form.<a name=\"_top3\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end3\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[3]</sup></a></p>\n\n\t<h4><i>Pleasure as Displeasure</i></h4>\n\t\n\t\n\t<p>In its lowest reaches, the Chain of Evolution yields things that are\n\tinconducive<a name=\"_top4\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end4\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[4]</sup></a> – or even contrary – to what G-d desires.<a name=\"_top5\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end5\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen, font-weight:\">[5]</sup></a>\n\t</p>\n\t\n\t<p><a name=\"_top6\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end6\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[6]</sup></a>The capacity of these things to give pleasure is an existential paradox.\n\tAll pleasure is but the embodiment of the divine pleasure in creation, while these pleasures are divine <u><b>dis</b></u>>pleasures – things contrary to creation>.<a name=\"_top7\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end7\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[7]</sup></a> Yet they, too, are products of the divine desire, since their capacity to give pleasure fills a certain function in G-d’s purpose in creation: G-d desired that we be confronted with a choice between\n\tgood and evil (so that our deeds should be meaningful and significant). But G-d wants that these things should exist only in order that man should reject them as contrary to His very existence; so theirs is an existence whose inner essence – those function and raison d’ētre – is not to exist.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Let's use the metaphor of digestion to explain the phenomenon.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Digestion is the process by which food passes through the various organs which break it down and separate its finer elements from its coarser ones. At each phase of the process, this separation grows more and more defined; ultimately,\n\tthe finer elements in the food evolve into body-building cells and energy, and its coarser elements are ejected by the body. Both the nutrients and the waste are products of the digestion system; but the former is generated to be used, while the latter is generated to be rejected and therby enable the body’s absorption of the former.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>By the same token, the Chain of Evolution is like the cosmic “digestive\n\tsystem” in which the essence of creation is processed into the substance and the energy of the universe that G-d desired. This process (like every process we know) also generates waste – elements that must be separated and disposed of in order for the desirable product to function.<a name=\"_top8anc\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end8\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[8]</sup></a></p>\n\t\n\t<p>Of course, G-d could have evolved His world in such a manner that the good develops without any separation of waste, or, for that matter, He could have not evolved it at all. But G-d desired that the good in creation should be all the more sharply defined by its contrast with the rejected evil; that human life should be an exercise in refinement – in distinguishing between the calories of divine energy and the sludge of putrid waste in our own self and character, our environment and our world. Indeed, the very concept of good, as we know it, would be devoid of all meaning were it not for the challenge of rejecting the evil that vies for validation and indulgence.)<a name=\"_top9\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end9\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[9]</sup></a></p>\n\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BDoufaoMDLM/X29YnxOpGtI/AAAAAAAAD8g/mv1fOFT2kUscYEBtY2Hfzl3cLfHKcJD9wCPcBGAYYCw/s249/250px-Adolf_Behrman_-_Talmudysci.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" width=\"320\" data-original-height=\"202\" data-original-width=\"249\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BDoufaoMDLM/X29YnxOpGtI/AAAAAAAAD8g/mv1fOFT2kUscYEBtY2Hfzl3cLfHKcJD9wCPcBGAYYCw/s320/250px-Adolf_Behrman_-_Talmudysci.jpg\" /></a></div>\n\t\n\t<p><a name=\"_top1\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end10\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[10]</sup></a>Based on the above, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, explains the following\n\tincident related in the Talmud:<a name=\"_top11\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_end11\"><sup style=\"color: lightgreen\">[11]</sup></a></p>\n\t\n\t<p>Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, Rabbi Yehushua and Rabbi Akiva were walking along the road when they heard the sounds of the crowds of Rome in the distance.

Thus, it is not contrary to G-d’s\n\t\t\tdesires, unless we interpret G-d’s desire to be what radiates\n\t\t\tfrom the Source, and thus as it gets further and further from the\n\t\t\tSource, it begins to contain less and less of it and thus is less\n\t\t\table to conduct the “desire”.\n\t\t\t</li><li>Remember, this is not spatial, although\n\t\t\twe have to use spacial constructs to explain it. <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/pleasure_as_displeasure/#_top5\"><span style=\"color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold\">↩</span></a>\n\t\t</li></ol>\n\t\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<a name=\"_end6\" style=\"color: lightgreen\"><b>6) </b></a>\t\n\t\t\tInterestingly enough, this is what happens to those who begin to descend into the \t\n\t\tdarkness.

Thus in\n\t\tthe usage of some archetypes, we use a word that is common to our\n\t\tculture. However, we do not wish to restrict it only to that\n\t\tcontext. If we speak of G-d, we think of G-d as both transcendent\n\t\tand immenent, as the One that is everything, everywhere and without\n\t\twhom nothing would exist. It could be Ha’Shem, Jehovah, the Holy\n\t\tSpirit, Allah, the Source, the Creator, Great Spirit, Buddha, Jesus,\n\t\tthe Holy Prophet, blessed be His name, and the names of all the\n\t\tprophets. These all call to that infinite Being that cannot be named\n\t\tby any name, by is called by all names.\n\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>If we refer to anthing or anyone, include G-d,\n\t\tin a particular gender it is not to diminish any other. We could\n\t\tplay the game of using She instead of He, or even It. But It is\n\t\tneither He nor She nor It. But we are restricted and constrained by\n\t\tthe terms and manner of the language and its cultural norms. In\n\t\tEnglish, we could use It. However, in Hebrew, there is no it –\n\t\tthus G-d is either He or She... and they chose He! Now we can turn\n\t\tall the He’s into She’s and then the gender problem will be\n\t\tsolved....</p>\n\t\t<p>The debate over gender is only pertinent with\n\t\tthe background of gender discrimination in a society. It has no\n\t\tintrinsic effect on that. Perhaps we have a bible that contains He\n\t\tand another version that uses She instead. The first is used by the\n\t\tmen, and the second by the women. BTW, if that was done in the\n\t\tHebrew bible, it would require the verbs to be changed to the\n\t\tfeminine form in these cases too. \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>I would rather seek to understand what we mean\n\t\twhen we use He and what aspect of G-d are we expressing when we use\n\t\tthe feminine pronoun. Let us explore deeper the feminine expression\n\t\tof G-d, and then only change those. We could possibly continue to\n\t\tuse the masculine form of the verb, as is often done in modern\n\t\tIsrael, with the feminine pronoun. I have to point out that there\n\t\tare many commentaries, some relying on the Gematria (numeration) of\n\t\tverses to derive certain conclusions. Many of these would no longer\n\t\tbe relevant if we amended the text.

I envisage a network of sharing that will enable them to be far more effective as well as a larger network that will enable them to be supported by a larger community upon which they can call upon in times of need and use as a market for their products and services. This is the part of the space which the network will serve – enabling more effectiveness, to be utilitarian and beneficial to all members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"internet\" tabindex=\"-1\">Internet <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#internet\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"scale-free-network\" tabindex=\"-1\">Scale free network <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#scale-free-network\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is a collection of routes linked by various physical lines. Ideally, the Internet would be a growing network with no central control authority. However, there are certain &quot;essential&quot; nodes, often referred to as hubs, and these will have influence over, and access to, many of the nodes connected to it.</p>\n<p>In the creation of a new seed, the basic node, or affinity group, two factors will determine whom to connect to: distance and bandwidth. While distance puts obvious constraints, bandwidth, which is a measure of the connection between the two people in a group, will typically be the dominant factor</p>\n<p>The study of Internet topology is crucial to investigate the robustness of the network under failures, which involve nodes randomly, and attacks, which purposely decimate network hubs. If the network is highly connected and dominated by few hubs, then random failures are generally not problematic, but a successful attack on a vital hub would have Draconian effects.</p>\n<p>Although the channels of communication are directed and controlled, what is being communicated and who hears it is controlled for the main part by the participants of this communication - until recently.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This has to be one of the most important issues to address in the creation of a sovereign, private, community driven and facilitated network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-world-wide-web-(social)\" tabindex=\"-1\">The World Wide Web (Social) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#the-world-wide-web-(social)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>This is a connected web in which nodes represent Web pages and edges are the hyperlinks between pages.</p>\n<p>This type of network is known as unweighted, as it is makes no intrinsic difference to the network how many connections any page is linked to, except for mapping purposes.

Our family is one. Your social circle is another. Both provide good examples of interlinking networks, webs are they are commonly referred to. Or one could think of them as circles that intersect at a certain point. John, your best friend works at IBM. Jill, your girlfriend works for an NGO... etc.</p>\n<p>Social networks link people according to various &quot;affinities&quot;, like friendship, interests, work, desires, and more mundane activities, like shopping &amp; entertainment. They are of extremely efficient mechanisms for the spread of information - both accurate and inaccurate - within groups, providing an accurate picture of the currents, both active and passive, in the ocean of human societies. They are wonderful tooos to better understand and anticipate the spread of ideas, innovatios, fads, as well as biological and computer viruses.</p>\n<p>For instance, the dominant position of hubs in sexual networks -- people with an extraordinary number of sexual partners -- has been adopted as an explanation of the partially unexpected diffusion and persistence of AIDS epidemic, which defies the predictions of classical epidemic models based on the homogeneous, random network hypothesis. Indeed, due to their high connectivity, hubs are easy to be infected and, once infected, they potentially can pass the virus to all linked people.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, social networks has been extensively used to measure the social standing of people participating in the network. The interpersonal directed links in a social network are interpreted as input-output channels for the transmission of influence, and the possibly negative weight of links captures the endorsement strength between individuals.</p>\n<p>These social networks are tracked, and can be easily exploited for various goals - mainly marketing - and through this social information, influencing the emergent social, political, media and information networks.</p>\n<p>Wether this exploitation is positive or negative is dependent on the intentions and goals of those wielding the information.</p>\n<p>Some of these networks are made by nature, other are built by humans. All of them are webs without a spider: there exist no central authority that regulates their growth, but evolve in a self-organized and decentralized way.<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/complexity.html#systems\">Complex Systems</a></p>\n<p>The majority of the natural networks have existed for many years. Some of them (biological networks) have been here since millions of years. In the last years many researchers independently showed that real networks have similar topologies, regardless of their age, function, and scope, that elude the random world. Nature doesn't play dice, and neither should the human builders of networks.</p>\n<p>It would behoove the architects of these social networks and communication systems to take a lesson from nature's book, and ensure that these networks are also no central authority that sits at the center of the web controlling its growth.

The rooted themselves in their own communities by only using all the services that the community offered them – exclusively. They purchased all their food from the community – as it has to be kosher. The education was provided by the community as they wanted their children to get a good Jewish education. (See the notes accompanying discourse on TOL). They taught them to read and write, to do arithmetic and to think critically, producing excellent doctors, accountants and lawyers, thus empowering them to both deal with the societies they found themselves in, and to be able to access essential services from within the community. In addition, when someone catered to a non-Jewish client, or worked for a non-Jewish employer, most of their earnings were pumped back into the community.</p>\n<p>This enabled them to enrich their own communities, as more money was coming into the community then was bleeding out of it – that is, supply exceeded demand.</p>\n<p>This structure has a number of qualities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It had a moral imperative that you could activate within the community. Thus there was recourse to a Rabbi who would make a moral decision about conflicts, rather than relying on an external legal process.

It is a bit animal like, eat and reproduce – though as we all know that its food is not organic, but economic – lacking the “higher” skills of judgement, morality, social consciousness, etc.</p>\n<p>That is one of the main reasons that we are speaking about it in terms of a nation, a nation being an entity that has a government, as a managing body, that is answerable to the members of the nation.</p>\n<p>What if we declared this network a Sovereign entity with citizens, laws, codes of behaviour, etc? Just as the Jewish culture has created a culture that is in essence a sovereign nation.</p>\n<p>I choose the concept of a nation, because our web has aspects of a nation, and that is why I sometimes speak of it as a community too.

And most times if there is something that one of the sanctioning countries, they will break the sanctions overtly or covertly.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Boycotts are better, because they are more personal. Through boycotts, once the critical mass is reached, we will be able to effect much change very quickly. As the call to arms has stated, “We vote with our dollars”.

We have to being to perceive our existence and what is happening and why from a 4d perspective, using the 3d structures, but not being constrained by its strictures.<br />\nOne could the 4d as movement in 3d. In fact, it is through this very movement/change of 3d objects, that have enabled us to discover and describe the 4d version of said 3d object. Only through some movement, some change of state in 3d, that we could not describe using our 3d mathematical tools, could we even become aware of the possibility of the existence of such a 4d entity, leading us to more accurate (4d) descriptions (of the 3d empirical experience of matter). We describe the 4d objects as a composite of what we know, 3d objects – just as 2d may form a composite of 3d forms.<br />\nAnd just as 2d is highly effective in a 3d environment, it is limited and be predicted and controlled from a 3d perspective... so it is regarding one who has a 4d perspective on our 3d existence.<br />\nUp till now, we have presented this 4d landscape in religious, mythological and sociological terms, emphasising the qualities of love, kindness, humility, gentleness, etc. Though it includes pride, greed, lust, desire, etc. too. One could describe this as the 4d aspect of human beings, an unpredictable indescribable experience that that can have huge effect on our lives. Even among the aspects of 4d that we do know or recognise, they all “suffer” from unpredicable, yet known, behaviour. That is, although we know how it behaves, we cannot say what it will do at any moment with any certainty, until it has already done it (made its choice – so as to say).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>We have managed to overcome much of what has threatened us in the past. I believe many of the ills that we suffer from now, at this point of human evolution, are caused by humans... us. // We are our own worst enemy. We say that on an individual basis, and, it seems, as regarding the present crises we are facing. \\ We are supposed to be an intelligent species – and we are. But if this is the best we can do, then it seems that some beastly, self-destructive urge is what has driven us to this evolutionary point.<br />\nMy message it for us to enter the timeless zone of 4d prepared, because judging from what is unfolding, we are passing through into this amazing place, full of incredible surprises and amazing gifts. But let us not charge blindly into the space that angels fear to tread.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shamans-and-mystics-(and-mekubalim)\" tabindex=\"-1\">Shamans &amp; Mystics (&amp; Mekubalim) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/4d-designs/#shamans-and-mystics-(and-mekubalim)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Shamans and mystics, those intrepid explorers of the other realms, have indeed encountered this space in the earliest of days. How they did, we do not know. But there are many records of such journeys and dealings with this realm from all over the world.<br />\nIn a time when the only language one could use to describe these realms was story and myth, we used archetypes and symbols that would awaken the unconscious mind, from mandalas to myth. However, we do have another language today to describe that space, although it is like the prince that will not take his place on the throne, denying all connection to his family – and that is the language of mathematics.<br />\nScience suffers from all the ills of any living religion. From the fanatics to the liberals, and all the various levels of interpretations of its texts, often by those who do not understand the original language it was written in.<br />\nSo let us enter into the magical realm of 4d and work together to live in a future that is not decreed and driven by this 3d chaos, but embraces where life is leading us, and gather to ensure a future for being human.</p>\n",

In that virtual reality you can project any persona you like, be multiple personalities, engaged in all sorts of social interactions – virtual for the most part, of course.</p>\n<h3 id=\"earthers-and-utopia\" tabindex=\"-1\">Earthers &amp; Utopia <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/game/#earthers-and-utopia\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Yes, the Earthers might decry this situation, where most of the world spends the majority of their time plugged into another reality (or realities), whatever tasks they are doing in the world of matter. These Earthers might sing the praises of a earthly lifestyle, where one grows ones own food, and eats the food that comes straight off the land, fresh and organic – while the rest of the world eat processed foods, synthesised and manufactured in human laboratories, as effective as that might ultimately be. Some even say it might be healthier – cleaner, more trustworthy as to the nutrient values, not subject to the vicissitudes of a fickle G-d. That we need to exercise regularly and breathe fresh air, swim in the ocean waters, walk amongst real trees.</p>\n<p>But what if you could be sitting in your comfortable chair and in your mind, be walking amongst the trees. You can smell the fresh pines and oaks, hear the birds chirping. Then stop off to take a swim in the river – knowing it was clean and safe. And you can experience all of this from that special chair in your living room, or lying on your comfortable, personally adapted, mattress – next to your loved one(s). Or you could decide to visit Paris and walk in the Louvre, with no one else around you could spend your afternoon gazing at the Mona Lisa – no crowds, no noise, just you and her. And if you wanted to, you could at the same time get close-ups of the painting, hear its history, or discuss painting techniques with the artist or others.</p>\n<p>Is that not the utopia we have always dreamed of? And now that we are on the precipice of this dream, we are baulking and saying that the price is too steep. But hear me, Earthers, you cannot stop the river of life from flowing along its path.</p>\n<p>Utopians have dreamed of a world without hunger and poverty. A world in which people live together in harmony, and work out disagreements and problems in a non-violent manner. Where everyone has access to the basic resources they need to live a decent life. Education is free and available to all. All the books and information (except for certain particularly harmful items) is available, subject to requester’s qualities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"present-future\" tabindex=\"-1\">Present future <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/game/#present-future\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>But have we ever thought about what that would look like with seven billion, 7,000,000,000 people on the planet – and growing every year exponentially? How much energy it would take to power that many people? What enormous amounts of food and water it would take to feed them? Or the amount of construction it takes to house them, especially if the majority have two places of abode – work and home. And let us not even touch on the amount of waste that is produced in the support and maintenance of this huge population of people. Include in this services, utilities, etc, etc... and we have a huge complicated mixture global and local systems of governance, trade, information, banking, etc. vying and competing to survive, cooperating for the most part, reluctantly.</p>\n<p>In fact the figures very quickly become mind boggling. If the average use of water is one litre per day, we use seven billion litres of water a day. There is not a dam in the world that can hold anything close to that. [more specific info?]. And we know that the average is probably larger than that, even if its distribution is extremely skewed, and that the excess usage in many countries is, thank God, balanced by the under usage, one could say starvation, of the less fortunate majority.</p>\n<p>So what if the future looks kind of dystopian? As long as we are not warring and killing and hurting and lying to one another as we are doing now. As long as people are no longer pretending to be someone else, and seek to express their authenticity, even if it is in the virtual world. Isn’t that what is most important? For the evil is not in the technology but in the hearts and minds of people.</p>\n<p>For instance, would it not be wonderful for a child to explore those fantasies and dreams that he has in a facilitated virtual reality environment? He could experience things that he would never have been able to experience, and might never experience again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addiction-and-aps\" tabindex=\"-1\">Addiction &amp; APS <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/game/#addiction-and-aps\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Yes, there is the danger of addiction, of anti-social behaviour, etc. etc. etc. But perhaps there will be enough to occupy the potential addict, perhaps we will have been thoughtful enough to place safeguards. Or perhaps that person’s soul journey is one of addiction. Perhaps the AI/cybercontract mechanism would be able to monitor such occurrences, and then there must be human/AI interaction with the affected youngster.</p>\n<p>But with APS – all pervading surveillance, how could one hide an addiction, especially of the sort that requires a connection to this virtual realm? What possibilities for crime here – just like smuggling people across countries when the world was caught up in national fever. And how to determine between an addiction and a healthy focus with concentration upon a certain topic or project.</p>\n<p>We could design it, build it, develop it, test it – and even run projections and collect information on its effect on other parts of the system. Then we could transition the project into the real world slowly, with checks and balances in place.</p>\n<p>[Addiction: those who become addicted. Don’t want to leave.

But could this not result in the same situation? If you have lots of credits, you can afford to spend a huge amount of time in cyberspace. But if you are earning credits, why would you waste your time in fantasy land?</p>\n<p>Plus there is the problem of a huge population that will have nothing to do, and nothing to incentivise them, that could turn very restive. There was only one solution – provide a living, and let them play in fantasy land.</p>\n<p>Could there be a way of earning credits in fantasy spaces? Of course there are. [Later – discussion of earning possibilities]</p>\n<h3 id=\"fantasy-land\" tabindex=\"-1\">Fantasy land <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/game/#fantasy-land\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>In fantasy land you can create any life you want. You can spend the evenings with your family and children, and then during the day, enter the fantasy land, where you can live any life you desire. You could be an engineer, building in outer-space, or an explorer of unknown realms. You could be an emperor in a far away land, with a harem and spend your days in erotic bliss... but that then become an addiction, and nothing will come of that. We cannot live in that empty limbo for long without causing ourselves inner damage. Thus it will need to be incentivised – for instance, an emperor might have to defend his empire. Just like the hackers of today, would there not be those who might steal or even peddle your erotic fantasy, one that you might have spent years building up and perfecting?</p>\n<p>It is similar to what is happening in the global financial system today. Where money has become more important than the actual item it represents. And where huge amounts of money are made and traded in the realm of money – an artificial, one could say, virtual realm. The realm of derivatives, loans, interest, etc.</p>\n<p>Everyone would be able to express his or her deepest dreams and fantasies, while all the rest was being taken care of by an AI/MI/cybercontract society. The price would be that it would know everything about you – what you did, every conversation, and now, every desire. However, there would be no incentive, as there is today, to exploit this information to get money out of you – this would and might only take place in the virtual world – and only those that allowed that. Invitations to participate in new worlds, projects, ideas and research.</p>\n<p>This would be closer to utopia than we have ever become. We may have found a wonderful solution to what ails us.<br />\nHow real, and how fantastic, do you want your fantasy to be. You could participate in things with real avatars – avatars that represent real people, even though they might have taken on another persona. A man might offer himself up as a women, and then have sex with many “men”, whose avatars have remained bound to the same sex. One could even be having sex with alien “beings” - who are avatars of real people. As opposed to fantasy avatars that you (or your group) might have created from your imagination, and your narrative unfolds between you and these avatars. A type of 4th generation solitaire. Or playing chess with yourself – except that you can interface with a AI or intelligent androids to create surprises and interesting twists. Of course you can decide what level of control you will have over the project.

This attitude has bothered me, as it appears in a number of significant places. For instance, Jacob is the good guy, and Esau the bad one, though, as the story unfolds, Jacob is the one that lies and betrays his brother's and his father's trust. Is it because he is a not of Israel? And thus cannot be claimed as a Jewish prophet?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_blalak/prophecy.html\">Prophecy</a><br />\nOr is that a certain, special type of prophecy has been granted to the children of Israel, and a different prophecy laid upon the other peoples? Perhaps the people of the Holy Land, sons of Zion, are able to receive the prophecy directly. While the others receive indirectly, through other means? This would explain their need for deification of the messenger!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But this is something that is only granted to those who are of Jewish blood. That is, once again, materialising what is spiritual. It is granted to all those who live in the Holy Land - which is not Israel (I am dreadfully sad to announce). This is shown by the fact that after two-thousand years of praying, and begging, and wanting to return to the Land of Israel, the people rush headling creating a nation that does not put G-d and His Commandments in the forefront of all that they do. From the beginning, all of it is rejected as extinct (or expired) - at least no longer relevant. Yet it is this very &quot;narrative&quot; that brought us back to Israel - which we then fill with all the detritus of the modern, godless society that run the world today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, it is those, all over and everywhere who still firmly and deeply and authentically believe in God, and try to live their lives serving as best they understand G-d's Will. Even if they fail, at least they are trying. They are believers. And in what do they believe? In a heaven on earth, as idealistic as that might seem, where we can live as human beings and interact in the way that most human beings wish to - kindly and lovingly - unless they have been twisted into some obscene shape by the non-believers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although Balaam has been portrayed as an evil man (who deserved to die at <em>Ba'al Peor</em>), in this reading - which, I must point out, is not named after him, but after the King, Balak, who coerced Balaam into cursing the Jewish people - he is not portrayed as an evil man.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_blalak/Balak.html\">Balak</a>. Perhaps there is also a deeper lesson hidden here, as we evolve and gain deeper insight into the words. We punish the perpetrator of a crime, the one who harms the other, even if he or she is carrying out the crime in the name or under the authority of someone else. We do not tend to go over the one who is issuing the orders. This is an pertinent exaple of this. Balak is actually the one behind Balaam's crime. Thus it make sense for the reading to be named after Balak, as he is the true perpetrator of Balaam's sin. Balaam would not have sinned so without Balak incentives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Looking at the story, a king (albeit temporary according to some texts) of a powerful nation requests that he, Bilaam, curse this people of Israel, who, to be honest, pose a threat to his kingdom. I mean, if a tribe of <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/judaica/parasha_blalak/nomads.html\">nomadic people</a>{what today has become refugees! For nomadic people naturally move with the seasons} had to appear at your border, you would be a little concerned too.</p>\n<p>I must also admit to a modicum of confusion about what the relationship of Moab was to Midian. Why did Balak consult the Midianite elders as well? Was this due to an alliance that he wished to forge with them? But if he wanted to use Balaam, why then did he approach the Midianite elders before doing so?</p>\n<p>Balaam really did not have too much of a choice. When a powerful king, Balak, enlists your aid, how do you refuse him? It will play out today as well. If the president asks a person for something...</p>\n<p>After the event, he had upset Balak, and thus the Midianites – who obviously were interested in enlisting his (Balaam’s) aid. He tried to make amends by advising them to engage the Israelites by enticing them with their women. He obviously had more connections to the Moabites and the Midianites than to the Israelites, and he needed to “repair” these relations after blessing the Israelites instead of cursing them. So he offered them this advice.</p>\n<p>30 June, 2018<br />\nNumbers Chap 22: 1. Interesting that it becomes named after Balak, who wished to curse the children of Israel, and not Balaam, who is the actual “hero” or protagonist in this portion. 2. v8: Upon the emissaries of Balak appearing before Balaam to induce him to curse the people, he responds to them, saying: “Spend the night. And if the Lord will speak to me. . .” He does not just succumb to their offer of reward, but says “if the Lord will speak to me”, in other words he must first wait for “instructions” as to how to proceed.<br />\nThere are more aspects to this interaction, for instance, although Balaam is not from the children of Israel, he is visited and speaks regularly with the Lord. How is that? It seems he has some way of communicating with the Lord, and is familiar enough to be able to hear and understand Him. We find examples of this peppered across the Torah. It seems, as well, that he is fairly competent at this communication, for one, he is known as a prophet, in addition, he asked them to stay the night, not longer, for him to “speak with the Lord.”<br />\nWe could ask the question of whether it is the same Lord God that he is speaking to? But there is only one Lord in the Torah.<br />\nBe that as it may, what I find fascinating is that he has communication with the Lord of Israel, even though he is not of the tribe of Israel. 3. v9: And as we see in v 9, he is correct, and indeed that evening “the Lord comes to Balaam, and speaks to him”. What is strange here, is that He asks him, “Who are these people?” as if he would not know.<br />\nv12: This time, as we read, He tells Balaam to send them away. “Do not go with them.” 4. They do not desist, and return again and again, offering him more and more. 5. v18: The final offer, almost open ended, is presented. “I will reap rewards and bounty upon him”. As if to say, name your price. Balaam again tells them to stay the night, as before, and that he has to ask the Lord, for as he clearly states, “I cannot transgress the Lord”, even though they offer him riches beyond his wildest dreams. 6. v20: Again the question: “Who are these men?” Why is He asking? What is missing here?<br />\nThis time the response however is “Go with these men, if they are emissaries of Balak.” 7. Immediately upon Bm setting out on his journey, we read that him heading out on this mission “Invokes the wrath of the Lord.” Why is that, I ask? In v20 he says if they are Balak’s people, go with them?” So why did that arouse anger in the Lord?<br />\nNevertheless it did, and He immediately dispatches an angel to. . . kill him? 8. Now we have the saga of the she-donkey, referred to hear as אָתון, though the Hebrew word for donkey is Chamor. What does <em>aton</em> actually mean? I ask this, because I ask what sort of animal this was that he “rode” on. For it is turns out that this <em>aton</em> sees angels and can speak (or communicate) with us.<br />\nIt is interesting that the angel appears 3 times, for the triple repetition is common. 9. v28: “He opens the mouth of the donkey” and the donkey speaks, quite rationally.<br />\nSome might say that it was the Lord who spoke through the mouth of the donkey, and that it was rational speech, might even be used as evidence of this. That might be sufficient for many, but I would like to see if I can understand it on a more prosaic level, for if one invokes the first explanation, then it overrides all others, and this statement eradicates any other possible explanation, and allows the commentator to continue, without having to wrangle with the depths of this teaching.<br />\nIn addition, why, if He had sent an Angel down, was it then necessary for the Lord Himself, Blessed be His Name, to have to speak through the mouth of a donkey? Why use a donkey – and not the angel that He had sent down? Is it perhaps that until Balaam’s eyes were open to seeing the Angel, he could not hear it either? Why is that? [It is common for the it to be said that the angel comes down, and the Lord, Blessings on all that He does and Is, speaks to him.<br />\nHow did he so easily understand and accept that the donkey could speak, and so rationally, to him? For he does not seem surprised by the donkey’s conversational tone. Surely he would have realised at that point he was being addressed by the Lord, if that was the case.</p>\n<p>This is such an enigmatic scene. Riding along on my donkey on a lovely day, my mind focused on this finely balanced goal of cursing the tribe of Israel for Balak, and suddenly my donkey speaks to me – in Aramaic or was it Hebrew – nevertheless in a language that I understand. Although, the Lord, who is All, can fashion and do anything, the actual mouth and tongue and vocal cords are not sufficient for it to speak in a human fashion – not that that would be a problem for the One that is Omnipotent. But why? Why not make it easy, and send someone, an angel even, to give him the message – just like the three strangers that came to Avraham, our father.</p>\n<p>I say that there is a “universal” language (I hesitate to call it a language – unless we decide to define a language as a set of symbols which are meaningful to the transmitter and the receiver. This could be sounds, shape, engravings, statues, images, etc. It could also be “chashmal” – the silence that speaks – for to speak is to “communicate” symbols. One could call it a type of telepathy – soundless communication, a “mental” transfer of images. It is “as if” it was speaking. One can hear the words, but there is no voice.</p>\n<pre><code>10. v30: He opened Balaam’s eyes, just as He opened the mouth of the donkey.  Although the Lord, who is King over all, opens Balaam’s eyes to see the angel (v30), He never opens his ears to hear Him (nor the donkey’s) speak. There is also the aspect of hearing – and understanding. For the donkey understood and answered Balaam quite clearly.\n11. v32: The angel now speaks to Balaam, using similar language as the donkey. [Does it say that?]. So, telepathy is a modern word, perhaps the more ancient and accurate word would be “angelic communication”. But why was Balaam thwarting the Lord’s wishes, when he had been instructed to go with them? And why was the Angel sent to kill him? And if the sentence was capital punishment – what was the mortal sin that Balaam had committed? Was he being punished for or by killing him, would prevent, the heinous act of cursing the tribe of Israel – of whom he was not a member, and who was being coerced by a powerful king to act. It seems that the sentence was rather server, and  if the sentence was that severe, how could the donkey’s seeing the angel have saved Balaam? How is that just the fact the she saw the Angel was sufficient to annul his punishment?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Balaam then offers to return, unaware of the Lord’s wrath, until the Angel announces it. 12. v35: However, the Angel’s response is for him to continue. Now if that is the case, then what was the previous “drama” about? I mean, Balaam was just obeying orders. . .<br />\nv38: What is added here are more explicit instructions on “speaking My words”. Did He not say that when he told Balaam to set out on his journey?<br />\n[I have just stumbled over the circular method of narrative that was apparently used for biblical stories. This would explain the strange circlularity of some of the narrative. Apparently it is a style that was common in those times. Today, it seems we have a more linear, or deterministic, way of telling our stories. Not that the story lines do not interweave, but it is more like a double helix arrangement, but seldom are the circular.<br />\nWhat I find interesting here, is there is no mention of the dignitaries nor the two servants that accompanied him when he set out. Which makes the use of the donkey even more interesting – for why not use one of the servants to speak to him instead? Why us the donkey...<br />\nChap 23: 13. v4: After preparing the first ceremony, the Lord “chanced” upon Balaam. What does “chanced” mean in this context? The Lord just happened to bump in to him on His way to. . .?” 14. Anyway, He “placed” something in Balaam’s mouth – “say as follows”. It is both scary and exciting when the Lord places something in my mouth. When I am fully conscious and present with the words that come from my mouth, it seems that it is the Lord that is speaking. The times when I am unaware of what I am really saying, are the times that it my Nefesh that is speaking 15. Balaam reiterates in v8, “How can I go against the Lord?”. And again in v12: “I must speak what the Lord puts into my mouth.” 16. v15: “I will be chanced (upon) here?” so says Balak. Is this referring to Balak or to G!d? (using Anochi - אנוכי). He could also be referring to Balaam, as the chancer. Will I be tricked (chanced) here too? But he is correct, for it says: The Lord chanced upon Balaam. v16. 17. Again Balaam says he has no choice, but must speak the Lord’s words.<br />\nChap 24: 18. v1: Balaam saw 19. v2: “Spirit of God rested on him”. So there is Balaam, not a Jewish prophet, who is visited by the Lord. As a result, this time G!d doesn’t put anything in his mouth, he just speaks – calling himself “the man with an open eye.” 20. v4: Lovely description 21. v13: After blessing the Jews, again Balaam says he cannot transgress the Lord’s wishes to Balak. 22. v4 = v15: open eye 23. v17-v24: strange prophecies<br />\nChanges:<br />\nBaal Peor: 24. v4: Hang the leaders 25. v5: The judges to kill the leaders. The leaders of what? Of the people. Or of specific people? Were there leaders who were leading this assimilation that was occurring?<br />\nPinchas 26. v6: bring woman into camp “in front of the eyes of Moses and the eyes of the children of Israel, who are weeping.” Why are they weeping? Is it because of what he is doing? Or is it because of the plague? 27. v8: Pinchas kills the two of them, and then the plague ceases. A plague, which killed 24k, that we did not hear about until now, unless we connect it with the “wrath of God” mentioned previously in v3. If the plague killed all those who were fraternising, then who did the Judges need to kill?</p>\n",

Jesus was born the messiah, the son of God. There was no special training he went through – though there has been much speculation on the matter. How did Mohammed, the Holy Prophet, become enlightened? He was a goat herder, an epileptic who had visions. No one taught him, he had not been an ardent practitioner of any training or tradition, though some may lay claim to that.<br />\nBuddha was born a prince, and stepping out of luxury into poverty, after encountering the real struggles of life, he went on a long journey of exploration – essentially rejecting all the mundane aspects of life. He may have studied and practised many paths to enlightenment, but it was essentially the impact of life that sent him on his quest.<br />\nMoses was not brought up Jewish – in fact, he pre-dates the Torah, upon which Judaism is based. His life was quite traumatic, but there was no revolutionary spirit, or visionary meditating and praying in the desert. In fact, he was herding sheep when God spoke to him. There are other examples, but the smaller ones are mostly offshoots variations on the major religion movements. (Zoroastrianism, Essene, Mormon, etc).</p>\n<p>My point here being that these Messianic spirits arose independently of the tradition which most of them would have been born into and practised. They often challenged the established faith, and introduced different forms of worship – that the established oligarchy often objected to. In fact, their inspiration, their “revelation” often comes from somewhere disconnected from the religion – some would say, simply, and solely, from G-d.</p>\n<p>As if often the case, true change comes mostly from the periphery. How can someone steeped in the established traditions, who believes fully in them and assiduously practises them, actually find an expression that could be different from what he knows? Similarly, could this could then only come from God as well?</p>\n<p>At present there is need to expand our religious repertoire, and enter into dialogue with the current religious paradigm – called science. Although it may have many faults, it also has many good points, and religion should focus on that rather than be in constant conflict with emperical truths - called laws - that have been discovered. Science has affected the way we live in many meaningful ways in the last centuries, perhaps more so than religion has - and that needs to be attended to by extending our religious discourse to include such things.</p>\n<p>For instance, there are many Jews who see that Kosher, which was interpreted according to different circumstances, is not taking into account the way in which living beings are being treated to provide us with our Kosher meat. It emerged in a time when there was no factory farming, with aweful conditions that require pharmaceuticals, supplements, pesticides, and hormones for the animal or plant to survive. Now there exist such things, spawns of this science – and it affects our food. So I ask, can the cow that has been fed all these supplements be healthy - even though all its organs look intact?</p>\n<p>We need to take face the reality of what is happening in the world today, and seek ways to navigate that – if not for our sakes, then for our childrens’ sakes. We are not talking about fads and fashions, trends or movements. We are talking about the changes in the very fabric of our society and its methods of production and extraction, manufacture and materials.</p>\n<p>Instead of trying to hold the tide back, why are the religions, guided by G-d, helping us to apply ourselves to finding truly “kosher” solutions to our lives in the midst of these changes – which have just begun.</p>\n<p>Step boldly and bravely into the gap. That is the reason that there is an over-abundance of rabbis. So that they may find solutions from our texts and our explorations to these issues. We need priestly/spiritual think tanks, synods to decide how to navigate the coming assault on everything that it means to be human and a man of Godly faith – against those who believe that human made is superior to divinely fashioned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enlightenment\" tabindex=\"-1\">Enlightenment <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#enlightenment\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>How many seekers have “reached enlightenment”? How can the unenlightened know or discern that this person is truly enlightened? Especially since, except for Moses – who wrote the five books of the Torah, but nothing of the rest of the opus of Jewish laws and litany – all their words were transcribed from their teachings. In the case of Jesus, it was after his death.</p>\n<h2 id=\"circle-of-human-possibilities\" tabindex=\"-1\">Circle of human possibilities <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#circle-of-human-possibilities\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Not all of us have the skill or talent.

It would contain all the characteristics that have ever manifested themselves as well as any that possibly could.<br />\nWe are each of us carved from this stone. Call it the root soul, if you like – <em>Adam Kadmon</em>. We are gifted with a certain selection from this pool of characteristics. Because we can change, we can always embrace through training, intent, purpose, focus, one of these characteristics.</p>\n<p>But, to embrace one of your gifts and use that time and energy and commitment to further that one, would probably be far more beneficial to all and sundry. Though, because it is a natural law, there are always exceptions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"human-elements-(he)\" tabindex=\"-1\">Human Elements (HE) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#human-elements-(he)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If you can’t master your own inner virtual space, how will you negotiate, develop, design, tech. spaces with their human elements?</p>\n<p>Human element(s) considers the full range of human characteristics, including the good and the bad.

An economic system based on a extremely flawed and limited appreciation on what it takes to be human, relating to only a small subset of human needs and aspirations, is clearly inadequite. One could say that any system affecting us is only as good as the description of the elements of the system. Just as QP is trying to describe the very elements that make up our environment, so we need to find another language, more appropriate symbols, to describe the human elements that make up all our systems, and for whom all our systems are (and if not, need to be) built.</p>\n",

Like the house I live in, my family, friends, my work, etc.”<br />\nYes, those are the symbols that reappear in many mandalas, though they might reappear in different places, similarly, your house might be in a different place in your life to mine. These symbols are representations of things that exist, but perhaps in another realm, or from another realm, but do reappear in our lives time and again. Just as these mandalas with their symbols tell a story, you, with your house and family, have a history.<br />\nImagine the mandala of your emotions then. Each day you awaken, you will produce a different mandala of emotions – even though those emotions might only come from a limited set of “symbols” – which we could term feelings or colours, as we often use colours to represent certain emotions.

It takes seven variable to completely (mathematically) describe a Turing computer (which is the “type” of computers we have). Surely we humans are more complex – but nevertheless this could be a fruitful area of exploration, using the same methods and thought process that caused the academics to agree to this description, to attempt to describe human behaviour.

From static, absolute, empirical view of objects that are time-invariant, to looking at events that are constantly becoming. That is, trying to find a local balance, or dynamic harmony within the greater system, and the local system. From a view of the universe that is static and absolutist, to one that is fluid, dynamic and relative.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How: Implementation: What are the steps necessary to implement to shift from this paradigm to that “new” paradigm?<br />\nInstead of creating, perhaps we need to learn as a society, a nation and a community to practice constraint.<br />\nIn any relationship of sharing there is a giver and a taker. One could say a loser and a winner. That is how energy flows. If the recipient uses all the energy to produce or maintain something productive, all and good. Waste is energy that is not utilised. If he hoards the energy, then it is not being used, and becomes toxic - for he will be collecting &quot;waste&quot; energy. If he (the recipient) has used his energy well, he will have regained his strength, and will be able now to become a giver... That is how the circles are completed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What: Design: What structures that will support that?<br />\nAny structures that are built primarily around Truth.<br />\nThat are supported by co-operation. That the planning is done by those who are the best people for the job.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why: Motivation: How will we embed our vision of a new world in the current reality that we live in?<br />\nIf it is the expression of the Oneness of everything, and everything that we are able to perceive and communicate with is respectfully dealt with - we will find the road to bliss.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why: Vision: How do we root this idea in the world?<br />\nPrayer, meditation, clear thinking, knowing that Truth is our sword.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;You may ask me often, what is this Truth that you speak of? You talk of it as if it is some sort of absolute. We all know that truth is relative, especially in a fluid universe. Tell us of this Truth.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This Truth that I speak of is also not static, yet it holds a position, and is measured by its distance from what is <strong>really</strong> happening - something we can never be truly aware of. This is because we firstly only see a small segment of the totality of any event, and secondly, because we can only perceive &amp; comprehend an event after it has occurred and if we have the appropriate means of measuring the change so as to be able to register said event.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It expresses itself too subsequent to the event itself. For there is the event itself, which cannot be discussed in relation to its truth or falsity, for it is simply the event. That is the &quot;reality&quot; of the occurrence. It is only subsequent to that, in the imaginarium of our minds, that we begin to cohere what had just occurred. As time passes, that memory, also fluid, is influenced by some of the factors that arise subsequently. Yet as it morphs, to the narrator it is still the sworn truth - as far as he or she is concerned, and there is little that will dissuade said person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, if we measure outcomes, the truth will always triumph in the end. Although slow, each one of her steps are true! Whereas lies flit around like a butterfly on cocaine, always seek peace, but never finding a place to rest, for it has to constantly feed and maintain the lie(s), and if it ceases for one moment, all the lies will come tumbling down like a house of cards. It has no source of its own, except the truth, that is its nemisis, and it will use her to its advantage if it can. Thus, of utmost importance, is to be able to discern between truth and lies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But how can one do that if one very parents lie. If one's teachers and leaders lie. Where is truth hiding?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brother, and sister, friend and foe, know that truth is never hidden. As we say, she hides in plain sight. For the event is the event, and the truth of the event stands as straight and firm as the shortest line between any two points. Everything else is an approximation, and the closest approximation, the truest rendition of the event itself, will, in the long run, always triumph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unless, of course, lies plays dirty - which one should always except from some low-life like that. It is the name of his game. And of course, we, even if we are truthsayers, need him, to always keep us clear of the distinction, so that we can better hone our ability to discern the actual Truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember one simple truth, and that is lies cannot hide the truth. They can only blind us to the truth, by causing us to look at what they are presenting - generally with more pazaz and glitter, more noise and impact. We are so like children.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"vision:-a-web-of-communities\" tabindex=\"-1\">Vision: A web of communities <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#vision:-a-web-of-communities\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Collectives of co-operation, clusters of affinity groups, like mycelium - feeding, supporting, using... a communications, transport and information network.</p>\n<p>I have named it “The Tree of Life Network”. It is essentially a collection of <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/sustainable.html\">communities</a> made up of like-minded people. A place where those who feel a deep mistrust of the current structure can gather, and begin to design &amp; build the society that we imagine, while being supported by a vast network co-ordinating and communicating the efforts of all these cultural creatives.</p>\n<p>To change oneself is the most difficult battle, to change a community is multiples more difficult. We need to evolve into a better system of social governance and trade relations, and can no longer be reliant on the present system. The only way to do that is to fashion a more effective system, one that better represents the reality of our global societies, not to waste our energy fighting &quot;for&quot; the current system.</p>\n<p>We are not here to convince you of anything, or to change your mind. We are not going to sing pretty songs to seduce you to follow our path. I say, either you know the truth, and are waiting to hear the call. What is commonly known as the call to freedom - &quot;Let my people go&quot;. But the only freedom we have is who/what we wish to serve - unless we have encountered the evil force which allows no choice, only obedience and fear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bible: Tale of exodus started of with a request for the community to go into the wilderness for 3 days to pray. Today, we exist in a situation where the pharaoh is refusing to allow us to gather and pray - not in our homes, nor our temples, not even in the wilderness are we allowed to gather in prayer any longer in many places in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If there exists another way, we have to manifest it - not just dream of it, not just speak of it. The question is, how do we do that?</p>\n<p>Up till now we have sought the One, the enlightened prophet, who will lead us to the Holy Land.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bible: Tale of exodus did not start off with a community seeking their Holy Land. They were not driven by a vision of living a &quot;better&quot; life - just of being free from the bondage of their overlords. Moses did not speak to the people, inspiring them with a vision of life in a Holy Land flowing with milk and honey. No - he spoke to the pharaoh! Only once they had been released from the bondage of the Pharaoh, and he was defeated, did they arrive at Sinai to receive the Torah. Like sheep whose gate some angel had opened, they rushed out of their paddock, not caring nor knowing where they were going. Thank G-d, their prophet led them to Sinai and the Torah. They had been chosen. How many of them even knew this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bible cont: It was surely a shock for most, to be suddenly put upon by thunder and lightening, and then told they are Chosen, and need to obey!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it any different nowadays? Has it changed? How many would readily leave their bondage to ascend on a journey into the wilderness? There was no vision that led the people out of Egypt, but perhaps they were driven by desperation - they, in essence, had little other hope for anything to ever improve. Is that not often the Sophie's Choice of members of any society? Either submit to the current regime and obey, benefiting from its boons, and accepting the yokes of its authority? Is that not how all groupings work - whether physical, or social, or cultural? And when it starts becoming extreme, and more authoritarian, and filled with fear and threats and betrayals and violence, what choice do you have?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Know the current system will not readily assent to that change. It will seem like the invasion of a foreign body, or that something foreign/uncomfortable is growing within it. It will try and absorb it, and if not then isolate it until it can destroy or remove it. Thus, essentially, it is not us that are pockets of resistance, but the system that is resisting us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We, the people, have to pull ourselves out of this mess. In order not to fall into another version of the same theme, however, we need to dream, sing &amp; pray, and build together.</p>\n<p>These communities are connected by affinities, forming a connected web. Within that network, we begin to co-ordinate, regulate, and maintain local, distributed networks, experimenting, exploring and building <em>alternatives</em> to the current way of interacting and transacting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is what the Jihadist movements offer the people - an alternative way of life. Not that most of them want the to live under repressive Islamic regimes, but they prefer that to the Christian, capatalist way of life. The freedoms that the Western Civilizations offer, are less appealing than the constraints that the Islamic way of life imposes. In the West, we would of course believe that it is imposed on them by the authorotarian patriarchal adherents to the religion, but that is convenient and fits into the correct narrative - from the perspective of the Western mind. However, by the same token, the Islamic adherents could respond with the same analysis of what is occurring in what believes it is the &quot;freest country in the world, a beacon of freedom to all the oppressed of the world&quot;, the USA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The beauty of this present time is that we don’t have to design it – it already exists and is widely manifest in all the big IT arena <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/cloud.html\">Google, FB, etc</a> - what we call the Cloud - we just have to adapt it to our use.

It can manifest any structure of connectivity that they wish to.</p>\n<p>Two examples of this are the internet and the net of Indra.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The internet consists of a vast collection of objects (computers) that are all connected via a complex set of protocols and lines of communication. It does not restrict whatever structure wishes to appear, for it forms an underlying web of connectivity that can be activated along lines chosen by the people themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The net of Indra is a vision of living spirits that comes from ancient Hindu texts. It speaks of our existences as jewels that sit in a vast network of light.

There are also particularly effective ways of ordering these connections to facilitate the spread of information and a fuller expression of the relationships existant and in potentia between the participants.</li>\n<li>Desire:<br />\nThere is a huge desire amongst all peoples to be engaging in communities of trust and support.</li>\n<li>Will/Commitment:<br />\nIs there sufficient will?</li>\n<li>Complexity:<br />\nThat there is a critical mass, a point at which people will be able to see and understand the concept.<a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/systems.html\">complex systems</a>.

As a graph, it is a generalisation of all organisational structure - similar to a <a href=\"https://neshama.com/qkab/waves.md\">wave</a>. What I wish to create is the structure on which this can express itself. This is, in fact, just an example of the way all social movements and in fact, all effective social constructs have organised themselves throughout the ages. All brotherhoods, guilds and ruling elites.</li>\n<li>Benefits/SpinOffs:<br />\nOnce the network manifests, there will be many spin-offs - just as we saw with the internet, and its spawn, the Web. It is about clearing and prepping the ground for the seeds to be planted, creating fertile ground for other expressions of the paradigm shift to emerge. It will be a space for projects, structures and applications.</li>\n<li>Organic:<br />\nNatural structures - <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/affinity_groups.html\">affinity groups</a> - emerge organically from this network structure, as groups that share an affinity to something, or some idea, or some expression - whether religious, creative, or other. These groups would cluster, as affinity groups, organised by purpose, creating networks woven within networks. This is an expression of the multi-dimensional/multi-layered aspects of our very existence.<br />\nAnd this HAS already happened. Except this very natural social phenomenon, the desire for connection, has been subverted by economic imperatives of the current imperialist system.</li>\n<li>Organisation:<br />\nThe primal connection is the personal one, so at its base it will be organised by physical proximity primarily – that is those that live physically close and wish/are able to share some energy. They organise themselves in another network of the same structure, but connected by shared purpose, (or idea, or project)\n<ul>\n<li>collectives, co-operatives, clubs - whatever form of co-operation suits them and their needs.<br />\nFor instance, <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/new_energy.html\">solar power projects</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Responsive:<br />\nThis is not an absolute, one size fits all, type of solution.</li>\n<li>Decentralised:<br />\nIt aims for a <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/descentralised.html\">decentralised system</a>.</li>\n<li>Fractal:<br />\nFractal nature of the structure.

The power comes from below, facilitated by the power which is above. There is enough will and creativity amongst all of us who envision another way of relating to the world around us to manifest the world we wish to live in.</p>\n<p>This expressive form of the network is tree like, which represents a more natural hierarchy: &quot;the less the power and the greater the area of responsibility, the less the power. Whilst the smaller the domain, the greater the power &amp; 'individual' sovereignty, as well as greater decision making power.&quot; This allows for the ultimate responsibility to lie on as low a level as is feasible. It envisages a structure that functions on the local level with global reach/functionality as well.

That the very technologies that enable computers to connect, monitor, react, spawn, maintain, design and architect be used to connect us and be used to further humanities needs and desires, instead of a small elite.</p>\n<p>To use the current technologies to create people-centric, instead of computer-centric networks.

The defect in the model appeared when, in order to succeed (financially) in the current socio-economic climate, it had to adopt the current model, and, run according to the dynamics of a successful business. However, when you are using technology in a unique fashion, and producing something new, your model begins to define the future of business, and thus, the regulatory systems of the current system are left in the dust, trying to grapple with the new, barely understood, models that are now dominant.</p>\n<p>In short, those that succeeded in managing the human/social interactions on this massive scale, were shaped by the environment in which they thrived.

The teacher was astounded that the young child completed the task in a surprising short amount of time. &quot;How did you get it done so quickly?&quot; asked the teacher, still in the throes of amazement. &quot;Well,&quot; said the young child with innocent eyes, &quot;on the back of the puzzle was a portrait of a man and that was easy for me to put together.

What is it that makes a culture &quot;sustainable?&quot; What are the essential characteristics that display the full range of &quot;sustainability&quot; levels in various cultures? And, might it be possible to develop something of a S-Culture Index to measure various societies and cultures on these dimensions? Here is an initial list of such characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures develop, propagate and update a compelling vision, a sense of transcendent purpose, and a series of superordinate goals to create common cause for a complex culture.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures focus on systemic health and well-being rather than on one-time initiatives or any magical &quot;quick-fix.&quot;</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures embrace the evolutionary dynamic and recognize that the center of gravity for the culture will shift as conditions of existence change in the milieu, either progressive or regressive.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures accept that dynamic tension is part of life itself and have learned how to differentiate between destructive and constructive conflict.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures disseminate self-reliance and responsible decision-making at every level, in every function, and on every issue.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures mesh the four bottom-lines – purpose, profit, people, and planet – and realize that to accomplish any one of the four they must also experience success in the other three.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures develop a sense of collective individuality in that the two are seen as cyclical blends and ratios rather than extremes or poles.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures respect the past-present-future timeline and think of each as an element in the seamless flow of nature.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures deal with causes and symptoms in a simultaneous, interdependent fashion.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures possess the capacity to renew themselves whenever the problems of existence create greater complexity than available solutions.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures integrate economic, political, social, environmental, spiritual and educational domains in an integral fashion.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures transmit their codes to the present generation while, at the same time, prepare the youth for different conditions in the near and far future.</li>\n<li>Sustainable Cultures transcend but include previous ways of being while always anticipating what will be next, thus living in open systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"challenge-to-nido\" tabindex=\"-1\">Challenge to NIDO <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/Sustainable%20Cultures/#challenge-to-nido\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Here is a unique challenge and opportunity that you might want to contemplate. Consider turning your community into a creative laboratory, a generator and depository of knowledge regarding sustainability, a global resource center for learning how to mesh &quot;clean&quot; energy, human needs, technological sophistication and natural habitats that can be transported elsewhere.</p>\n<p>To make all of the above possible, I wish to offer new insights and procedures within these two areas – <em>Constructive Dialogue and Cooperative Action</em>. I will suggest that many of our usual constructive dialogue sessions are limited whenever they drive us into unhealthy and nonproductive circles of consensus-making rather than focus specifically on the nature of problems and their unique solutions. Second, we continue to compromise our capacity to mobilize (cooperative action) quickly and skillfully all of the resources necessary in a given situation, because our decision-making and implementation efforts are clogged by personal ambition, by rigid rule-makers who live in bureaucratic boxes, by cash-in mentalities that cannot see beyond a bank balance, or even by outside predators who bring dangerous viruses into your historic cultural canals and delicate and sensitive meshlands.</p>\n<h2 id=\"now-the-main-act...\" tabindex=\"-1\">Now, the Main Act... <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/Sustainable%20Cultures/#now-the-main-act...\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>To create and sustain a S-Culture, one that has the capacity, resilience, and vision to survive and prosper in the 21st Century context, the following four actions should be taken:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understand the codes and dynamics that shape cultures and drive change.</li>\n<li>Monitor vital signs and tension zones to track levels of sustainability.</li>\n<li>Implement integral policies to promote cultural health and sustainability.</li>\n<li>Employ skilful means to enhance adaptive intelligences for today and tomorrow.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This description will only illustrate the ideas and recommendations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understand-the-codes-that-shape-cultures-and-drive-change\" tabindex=\"-1\">Understand the codes that shape cultures and drive change <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/Sustainable%20Cultures/#understand-the-codes-that-shape-cultures-and-drive-change\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Cultures, as well as countries, are formed by the emergence of value systems (social stages) in response to life conditions. Such complex adaptive intelligences form the glue that bonds a group together, defines who they are as a people, and reflects the place on the planet they inhabit. These cultural waves, much like the Russian dolls (a doll embedded within a doll embedded within a doll), have formed, over time, into unique mixtures and blends of instructional and survival codes, myths of origin, artistic forms, life styles, and senses of community. While they are all legitimate expressions of the human experience, they are not &quot;equal&quot; in their capacities to deal with complex problems in society.</p>\n<p>Yet, the detectable social stages within cultures are not Calvinistic scripts that lock us into choices against our will. Nor are they inevitable steps on a predetermined staircase, or magically appearing like crop circle structures in our collective psyche. Cultures should not be seen as rigid types, having permanent traits. Instead, they are core adaptive intelligences that ebb and flow, progress and regress, with the capacity to lay on new levels of complexity (value systems) when conditions warrant. Much like an onion, they form layers on layers on layers. There is no final state, no ultimate destination, no utopian paradise. Each stage is but a prelude to the next, then the next, then the next.</p>\n<p>Each emerging social stage or cultural wave contains a more expansive horizon, a more complex organizing principle, with newly calibrated priorities, mindsets, and specific bottom-lines. All of the previously acquired social stages remain in the composite value system to determine the unique texture of a given culture, country, or society. In author/philosopher Ken Wilber's language, each new social stage transcends but includes &quot;all of those which have come before&quot;. Societies with the capacity to change, swing between I:Me:Mine and We:Us:Our poles. Tilts in one direction create the need to self-correct, thus causing a shift toward the opposite pole. &quot;Me&quot; decades become &quot;Us&quot; epochs as we constantly spiral up, or spiral down in response to life conditions. Some social stages stress diversity generators that reward individual initiatives and value human rights. Other social stages impose conformity regulators and reward cooperative, collective actions. Societies will zigzag between these two poles, thus embracing different models at each tilt.</p>\n<p>Once a new social stage appears in a culture, it will spread its instructional codes and life-priority messages throughout that culture's surface-level expressions: religion, economic and political arrangements, psychological and anthropological theories, views of human nature, and our future destiny, globalization, and even architectural patterns and sports preferences. We all live in flow states; there is always new wine, always old wineskins. We, indeed, find ourselves pursuing a neverending quest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-living-strata-in-our-psycho-cultural-archeology\" tabindex=\"-1\">THE LIVING STRATA IN OUR PSYCHO-CULTURAL ARCHEOLOGY <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/Sustainable%20Cultures/#the-living-strata-in-our-psycho-cultural-archeology\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Here's the key idea.</p>\n<p>Different societies, cultures and subcultures, as well as entire nations are at different levels of psycho-cultural emergence, as displayed within these evolutionary levels of complexity. Yet, and here is a critical concept, the previously awakened levels do not disappear. Rather, they stay active within the value system stacks, thus impacting the nature of the more complex systems. So, many of the same issues we confront on the West Bank (red to blue) can be found in South Central Los Angeles. One can experience the animistic (purple) worldview on Bourbon Street as well as in Zaire. Matters brought before city council in Minneapolis (orange to green to yellow) are not unlike the debates in front of governing bodies in the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>So-called Third World societies are dealing, for the most part, with issues within the beige to purple to red to blue zones, thus higher rates of violence and poverty. Staying alive, finding safety, and dealing with feudal age conditions matter most. Second World societies are characterized by authoritarian (blue) one-party states, whether from the right or the left. Makes no difference. So-called First World nations and groupings have achieved high levels of affluence, with lower birth rates, and more expansive use of technology. While centered in the strategic, free-market driven, and individual liberty focused perspective — all traits of the Stage 5 (orange) worldview — new value systems (green, yellow, and turquoise) are emerging in the &quot;postmodern&quot; age. Yet, we have no language for anything beyond First World, believing that is the final state, the &quot;end of history.&quot; Further, there is a serious question as to whether the billions of people who are now exiting Second and Third World life styles can anticipate the same level of affluence as they see on First World television screens. And, what will happen to the environment if every Chinese family had a two-car garage?</p>\n<p>The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the GTO, and most multinational corporations reflect the blue-orange worldview codes of cultural discipline, financial accountability, and individual responsibility. Attacks are launched from three directions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Red zone activists, anarchists, and spoilers who love a good fight, and believe the Big Orange Money Machines are easy targets from which to exact tributes in various forms;</li>\n<li>Blue zone ideologies who defend the sacred against the secular and resent the intrusive technology and destruction of the holy orders and extol the purity of the faith, noble cause, and divine calling; and</li>\n<li>Green zone humanists and environmentalists who level charges of exploitation, greed, and selfishness, noting the eradication of indigenous cultures and the poisoning of the &quot;pristine' environment by Big Mac golden arches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TIn addition to this Spiral Dynamic-based analysis of the shaping codes and changing priorities, author Howard Bloom describes a five process Pentad that encapsulates the &quot;Prime Directive&quot; in operation.</p>\n<p>Finally, based on the All Quadrants/All Levels schematic designed by Ken Wilber, note how these core vMeme codes display their themes in the Individual (invisible/interior and visible/exterior) and Collective (invisible/interior and visible/exterior) Quadrants. Any successful sustainability project should constantly search for ways to inculcate the environmental message onto a much larger psychological footprint, one that spreads throughout the cultural &quot;canals.&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"monitor-vital-signs-and-tension-zones-to-track-sustainability-indicators\" tabindex=\"-1\">Monitor vital signs and tension zones to track sustainability indicators <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/Sustainable%20Cultures/#monitor-vital-signs-and-tension-zones-to-track-sustainability-indicators\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Whenever one seeks after a complete medical check-up, you expect the doctor to construct a vital signs portrait of yourself – your chemical, electrical, psychological and biological indicators – in a search for abnormalities and early signs of serious trouble. Imagine a time in the near future when leaders couild see displayed, on floor-to-ceiling video screens, the &quot;vital signs&quot; of the entire society, especially those that reveal the levels of sustainability.<br />\nThis GIS (geographic information systems) process that overlays data and patterns onto geographic places could be used to search for the relationships between and among these displays. We often see such maps of economic well-being, crime types and patterns, health-care indicators, living conditions, and other critical data flows that simply gather dust on some administrator's desk. Then add in the rich personal and neighbourhood profiles based on mass customization marketing strategies. What if we could place these data streams and mosaics on top of each other to look for the early signs of environmental &quot;trouble?&quot; Moreover, we should be able to track issues and adaptive intelligences on the spiral &quot;levels&quot; and among the &quot;quadrants&quot; just as well.</p>\n<p>Since GIS technology is very advanced, most of the information that we would want to display is already available. All we need to do is bring it together in such a form that we can &quot;see&quot; it all at once, displayed in a single place. Since our thinking is impacted by chaos/order ratios and self-organizing principles, our task would be to create natural designs that implement these adaptive intelligences on the part of individuals and social groupings. Rather than create a regimented, social control monolith, the intent would be to inform the general public of these &quot;vital signs&quot; so that they can exercise their informed &quot;self-reliance.'</p>\n<p>Then, after our Network has taken the lead to create and field-test this powerful technology, just imagine what would happen if a similar effort were launched at the United Nations to design a Vital Signs Monitor for the entire planet. One can already find EarthPulse-type monitors of the physical universe, but what is lacking is the 4Q/8L perspective, especially since the left-handed invisible quadrants are seldom if ever recognized, much less revealed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implement-integral-policies-to-promote-cultural-sustainability\" tabindex=\"-1\">Implement integral policies to promote cultural sustainability <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/Sustainable%20Cultures/#implement-integral-policies-to-promote-cultural-sustainability\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>If we are able to read the deeper codes that shape cultures and trigger shifts in the underlying belief systems, and have made some progress in monitoring the vital signs, then we are in a much better position to design effective Constructive Dialogue processes. There are, of course, many different decision-making and problem resolution methods which are especially suited for different situations. To both design and maintain sustainable cultures, a specific technology will be required. I refer to this as a MeshWorks.</p>\n<p>A MeshWorks is a form of Constructive Dialogue that deals specifically with the &quot;Humpty Dumpty Effect,&quot; a condition created when a Tower of Babel of spokespeople, solution mongers and stakeholders end up making things worse, not better. Even though they are all doing the very best they know how to do, they are unable to deal with the complex problems that need resolution.</p>\n<p>MeshWORKS thinking illustrates how to get all of the entities &quot;on the same page&quot; to focus their resources like laser beams on the inevitable steps and stages of development that form healthy cultures. A key component in this process has been described by <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/Sustainable%20Cultures/www.adizes.com\">Dr. Ichak Adizes</a> in what he calls CAPI – Coalescing Authority, Power, and Influence at the same time on the same problem. Authority refers to those who represent the system; Power indicates those who can support or sabotage; and Influence involves those with expert views or insights. Too often we only have one or two of these represented in the Constructive Dialogue. We have all seen this happen before, in spite of our very best intentions…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Authorities decide on policy and then drive it down the organization.</li>\n<li>The Wheeler-Dealers construct a win:win for themselves and leave others out in the cold.</li>\n<li>The Consensus-Feelers spend countless hours in dialogic circles insisting that everybody have a say and be included.</li>\n<li>The Majority-Rule Mandaters who believe that a 50% plus one vote should always rule the roost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MeshWeavers are able to infuse into the Constructive Dialogue an understanding of the deeper value system codes so that efforts can be tailored for specific situations and different levels of thinking in the people involved. Such an effort can provide the cohesive principle that is missing in the age of fragmentation. This approach can generate transpartisan approaches to policy formulation that is vastly superior to either partisan or bipartisan efforts.</p>\n<p>The key technology, here, is to place competing values system codes on the ends of the paradox to demonstrate how both/and thinking is superior to either/or ultimatums. This would be a creative way for pro-growth (usually the orange vMeme), and pro-quality of life (combinations of green and yellow) can often find ways to accomplish both in a synergistic fashion.</p>\n<p>Employ skilful means to enhance adaptive intelligences throughout</p>\n<p>Since a Sustainable Culture has been able to disseminate, in a holistic fashion, the core intelligences throughout the entity rather than gather them all at the top or in elitist centers of influence, it must search for innovative ways and skilful means to convey information and knowledge far and wide.<br />\nHere is a case study in Cooperative Action. The issue will be the environment. The challenge is to find better ways – skilful means – to communicate to both the youth and society-at-large through a neutral, universal, and quite attractive set of characters. These characters, along with well written story lines, will be able to carry the message in both the printed word, through electronic transmission media, and in other forms as well. They will be able not only to deal with environmental content, but to couch their messages within the value system codes in order to penetrate more deeply into mass minds.</p>\n<p>We will enlist Misty (purple), Breeze (red), Fauna (blue), Pulsar (orange) Geo (green), Synapse (yellow) and Bloom (turquoise) in this endeavour. In their original version, they are all communicating more or less in the deep ecological (green) band. Note how we can get each to express the importance of environmental sustainability – but in the language of the entire spectrum of vMeme codes. By doing so, our intent will be to retreat from vMeme warfare to get all of the codes embracing the commonly held superordinate goal.</p>\n<p>A FINAL NOTE</p>\n<p>I want to thank Bruce Galbraith and Paul Gerstenberger, owners and developers of the <a href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/Sustainable%20Cultures/www.theecoisp.com\">EcoPALS</a> concept, for allowing us to use these seven wonderful spokespersons for Sustainable Cultures. As you might expect, Synapse is now in charge of the Vital Signs Center worldwide.</p>\n",

Firstly through tradition and culture, and then after my 13th year, I began to explore the texts of other faiths and mystical movements. By my 40’s my exploration was focussed on Kabbalah and its teachings, when I began entering into a more deeply and more shamanically based teaching. That was the key, and it all fell into place.</p>\n<p>I understood how it worked – not perfectly, of course for I am human and limited by my constraints. But I understood deeply, I had attained some wisdom.</p>\n<p>However, the difficulty was what to do with it. As I became more deeply steeped in these teachings, so I seemed to become less grounded, less able, in the “real” world. It confused me how we all are bathed in the light, but yet continue to seek and toy with the darkness and chaos. How there is a deep longing in us for the darkness, almost an embedded need.</p>\n<p>The sages say that we are born with two inclinations – one the good inclination, the other the evil. And we have free choice in this matter, and can follow the path of the good or choose the evil path. Then one of the masters pointed out that most of us are <em>benonim</em> – walk the middle ground, with some bad and some good.</p>\n<p>He obviously was embracing the relativistic model, which says that the important thing is what is your intention, what is your goal, what are your thoughts on the matter? Are they good? Or are they evil? In fact, he is merciful enough to ask whether most of your thoughts lean towards the good or towards the evil – for to be perfectly good is attained by only a few righteous souls. And no one can be truly evil, for everyone, everything that exists in Creation has to have a spark of Divine (Creator) light in it.</p>\n<p>In the light of that analysis, I have done little evil in my life. I am not monogamous, which is looked at as a sin in our culture – due to the commandment against adultery. Though it was in a polygamous society in which the stricture not to sleep with a woman who you are not wedded to. Though Abraham and Jacob had non-adulterous relations with woman who were not their wives, but their wives maidservants.<br />\nThis was a time were sex was not the issue, but offspring. When Jacob slept with ??? on the road, thinking she was a harlot – which seemed to be acceptable behaviour – for that was not what was the issue at hand, but that she had become pregnant out of wedlock. That is what branded her a harlot, not seducing some guy on the side of the road. Nor was he in any way culpable – until she proved that it was him. It was not about love – that she loved him and wanted him, but about the child and inheritance rights. This was a world in which sex was like any other natural event of the human existence. It was about the material rights in this world expressed through children – the most important event in a person’s life, as it meant that there was a possible future. It was a time when the pulse of life flowed strongly through our veins.</p>\n<p>We are at a conundrum now. We have enough people on the planet. We do not need more – and might need less. Yet we still believe that one of our basic rights and needs is to bear children. It has gone from an imperative to a right. All the energy of this life force is no longer needed to only procreate – it needs to be channelled into other directions, for if it is not diverted into positive actions, it will become expressed in negative ones. The rapist is seldom one who is sexually fulfilled in his life – unless he has had a certain trauma that has caused a psychotic reaction.</p>\n<p>It is the stepping from adolescent to adult behaviour, taking charge of our future as a collective. No longer deluded that, except for a very few, anyone can exist on his or her own. To become more aware of all it takes just to exist on this earth as a human being from all the resources that are needed – food, water, air, clothes, shelter, energy, transport for the basics; then entertainment, work, education, etc., etc.</p>\n<p>The structure cannot survive with a tiny few having more than a vast majority of people. That is just not right. In fact, it might be downright evil. You decide. Remembering that whether you are part of the elite or part of the disenfranchised economically, that might taint your response. Because it is natural for a system – just like a living being, because in fact all our systems are in the end run and fed by human beings – to want to survive, and do everything and anything it needs to do survive. However, this system is killing us.</p>\n<p>Of course, the first and most important goal here would be to distinguish between good and evil. Though that could be relative – as we see often enough in our world. When good is fighting evil, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two in the heat of the battle. Is it acceptable to do evil things for a good cause? Is it acceptable to do the same evil things that evil does in the battle against evil? To an established order, those that threaten its stability are branded terrorists and looked at as evil, because they kill innocent citizens. Though these people, who rose up against an order that has been established by tyranny and fear, and are fighting for freedom and human rights, are not truly evil.</p>\n<p>So is it your thoughts? Or the reason that you do these terrible things that determines whether they are terrible or not? Is it just the circumstances and the reasons you do these things that is the ultimate criterion of good or evil? If I do it “for God” - as I perceive Him – is that good? Even if I kill and maim and torture and hurt and enslave other beings? Is that what God wants from us? To kill one another? To hurt one another? Is that God’s plan? His purpose for creation – a fight club, where millions fight and die?<br />\nIf that is the case, it is reaching absurd heights. For no longer will there be wars or battles between peoples and nations, it will just mean annihilation – perhaps for that nation, or perhaps for the entire humanity. A number of flashes in the sky is what for many will be there last moment, while for many others a slow, bleeding death – lingering for many years, till we are all gone.</p>\n<p>We are living in a world run by a lot of sabre rattling madmen. Though to upset everything, you only have to have one of these madmen to create a mad scenario. There is only one motivation for people of this ilk, and it is power. That is evil.</p>\n",

And I had that for a long time. Then I fell deeply in love with a South African woman, who has insisted that I remain monogamous, and it is only since I had a couple of affairs, and she totally freaked out, that I have been considering having discreet affairs totally disconnected from my life ala last tango in Paris.</p>\n<p>So, when the woman said hello,to me as I walked by Pima proverb in camps bay, and I responded, noticing her friend trying to get a peek at me, I knew what this was about. They were two women on holiday looking for some action. I continued on because I had made arrangements to meet with Jenn and rob, and was already running a bit late. Upon approaching the car, I could still feel their pull, and was considering cancelling and entering this tête-à-tête.</p>\n<p>As I drove away, I looked into my feelings. I should be feeling proud of myself for not succumbing to the temptation, instead I felt more that once again spirit was offering me an adventure that I was denying, because of comfort.</p>\n<p>I could have returned to the place, had a cup of coffee, and then excuse myself, and make an arrangement to meet tomorrow evening. It is what I am trying to do now, and that is step into the world as a man and take charge of my life - and accept responsibility for another's.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dream-(2016-03-22)\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dream (2016-03-22) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/story/personal/#dream-(2016-03-22)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Woke in pain. Body aching, some molten energy in body, hurting. Did not fight it, rose switched light on. Went into garden and peed.</p>\n<p>Then dreamt. In place with others in b&amp;b type place. Gathering or convention. People all around. Had been in room no 3. This was continuation of previous dream which I don't remember, just vaguely, almost like feelings.</p>\n<p>Returning to room 3. Had difficulty finding it. Was in mess, but recognized it.</p>\n<p>Slept outside in garden on grassy patch. with some companion who was like a Servant or a pupil, or even a presence. Now, in the light of the day, it feels like it might have been lyn, who is tracking me, afraid, all the time.</p>\n<p>Wake up to see rats coming onto grass, but they retreat back to bush surrounding patch. Lie down again. Then these black beetles, making a shrill chirping sound appear, and their energy is malevolent, so we leave post-haste I've had enough.</p>\n<p>Return to structure, towards my room. Pass by people in building. One says to me nice fire style you have, and points to my head. I glance in the mirror, and see something sticking up like a Mohawk cut in the middle of my forehead. I look more carefully and relies that it is a big black praying mantis type of insect. I brush it off, and it flies off me. I cannot see it. So I go into the large room next to the corridor that leads to the rooms - the corridor is where this happens - and warn everyone about this insect. The next moment this young woman sitting just in the corridor rises and swats this malurgie that was on a pillar/outcrop on in the corridor. She uses her hand and just smacks it, not concerned at all about its derems squishing all over her hand.</p>\n<p>I wake up, kind of disturbed and angry, feeling trapped in this situation with lyn in Hogsback. Then I start fantasise about her arriving and being her master... Stand, hands behind back. Tie them. Cane her over beam. Stick my cock deep in her throat. Place her on knees and get her to worship my cock....</p>\n<p>Then think of Rachel at party. Want last tango in Paris interaction. Just approach her and offer her one night of sex. No names, no relationship, just night of enjoyment. Let's kiss, and then you decide.</p>\n<p>Think of living my life in that masculine mode, instead of the new ages nicer nicely, thinking of the other, being pic, caring about the other, etc, Eric. I am not advocating violation, or rape, or anything like that, but being clear and expressing your needs or wants in the situation, and the if the universe responds positively.... Making it happen.</p>\n<p>Blessed are you o Lord, our God, who is the creator and manifest or of all things, good and bad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lyn-(2016)\" tabindex=\"-1\">Lyn (2016) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/story/personal/#lyn-(2016)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I just want to express my gratitude for what we shared together. For the gift of offering and opening your home and your heart to me. For being willing to embark with me on and share the journey of our lives so deeply. You will always remain a part of my life. You helped me go through a transition, one which you were a mirror of and for me and for you. For me, it is always a humbling and awe inspiring event in and for my life when I meet someone with whom I can go so deeply and so intimately so immediately. It is immense and for that I will always be grateful. I just want you to know how appreciative I am of all that you gave and received. I am honored and was deeply nurtured by all that occurred between us.</p>\n<p>I am not meant to share this, because it will be feeding the energy of love between us, which is forbidden according to the code of honor that is a requirement of a shared and committed life, a life filled with principles and honor as defined by our culture. But I will do so anyways, and know that I do it in another dimension, a place of other, than what is required to be in this world realm, because I rather that, than dishonour what we had with spirit. But we can justify any action anyway, so it also boils do an to that I want to share with you in my gratitude.</p>\n<p>Each time I enter your car, I breathe in your smell. I think and thank you while driving and send out thoughts of love and joy. No wonder you felt me at times.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dream-(2016-03-23)\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dream (2016-03-23) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/story/personal/#dream-(2016-03-23)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Remember part where Hogsback house falls down. Had been having difficulties with people and the place. But it was a house made from stone and brick, with wooden circular pillars every meter or so, and a large yellowish-orange pipe, almost like a paper mache kite/rice paper lampshade - except it was large and ran into the house from the one side above the ceiling. The pillars were made with semi-circular pieces of wood stacked to make a pillar.</p>\n<p>We came back to watch each pillar slowly fall and detach itself from the wall. Then there was a moment before the pipe slowly collapsed. It was horrible. And we did not know what to do.</p>\n<p>I woke up again with the need to take charge of my and Lyn's affairs. Of sorting out the insurances, and her finances. She will need to submit. No, more autonomy for her.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PostNote: I never did manage to take charge of our affairs. She refuses to submit to this. So, she gained more autonomy, less freedom, and more difficulties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-beast-and-the-angel-(poem)\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Beast &amp; The Angel (Poem) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://neshama.com/posts/story/personal/#the-beast-and-the-angel-(poem)\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In the bowels of the beast sleeps an angel<br />\nTread lightly little one<br />\nSpeak softly woman of the wild<br />\nRemove all your clothes.<br />\nYou may enter His chamber naked<br />\nas the day you were born<br />\nfor every covering<br />\nwill He tear<br />\nfrom your tremulous grip.</p>\n<p>Kneel.<br />\nEyes downcast, naked breasts shining,<br />\nlegs spread, offering Him access<br />\nto your most secret places.<br />\nBreathe deeply,<br />\neven though your heart might be fluttering.<br />\nIs it fear or is it excitement?<br />\nBreathe again.<br />\nAs you feel His attention<br />\nfocusing on you<br />\nyour body<br />\nbegins to melt.<br />\nIt awakens<br />\nto meet the energy<br />\nflowing over it,<br />\nnipples rising and<br />\na slight shiver<br />\nrunning up and down your spine.<br />\nKnowing that the only weapon<br />\nyou have<br />\nto subdue the beast is buried<br />\ndeep in the core<br />\nof your womanhood.<br />\nOnly when he has torn away<br />\nall of its coverings<br />\nlaid you bare,<br />\nwill He allow you close.<br />\nThe sudden first touch sears you<br />\nand you gasp.<br />\nQuiet little one.<br />\nBreathe again.<br />\nIt is just the start.</p>\n<h2 id=\"this-is-the-way-i-look-at-it.-(mandf)\" tabindex=\"-1\">This is the way i look at it.

Because it is only there you can encounter your beloved. Think of it as Her boudoir.</p>\n<p>Beware if you encounter Her or any of her angels anywhere else for that will then herald a cataclysmic, life changing event, a '<em>Hineni</em>' moment.</p>\n<p>Women can do that anywhere, not needing much to open those gates. Men need direction and protocols. They need daily practice, preferably following a certain routine. Women are naturally timekeepers as they have their built in clocks. Men need rituals and nature to remind them. Unfortunately they can also be used to bind them.</p>\n<p>But that is essentially why a lot of the rituals are man made. It is often a struggle for the man to be uplifted by the feminine form of the ritual, yet more often than not the women can be uplifted by the male form.</p>\n<p>That is why it is as a reward that the soul is born as woman. She has an innate connection with the Divine, which she can deny, with its associated results - which is a whole discussion on its own. She is often called to selfless service like a <em>bhodisattva</em>.</p>\n<p>In this time of flux, the women are at the forefront of the emerging structure. However this may be because few men are stepping forward to lead for in her heart this is what she truly desires - so that she may continue providing her loving care to those around her. <em>Eshet chayal</em>, we call her - the woman warrior.</p>\n<p>As the groups became bound more to protocols, they lost the connection between the rituals as an expression of natural cycles, and they became an expression of the structure of the communities instead. Constantly available light is one of the obvious examples of this, providing us a space totally removed from the darkness surrounding us. It is perhaps our fear of death that propels us in this direction as it provides us with the incentive to excel, to be remembered and thus become immortalized...</p>\n",
