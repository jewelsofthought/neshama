This reﬂects a shift inemphasis from reductionism to holism. Systems science seeks to provide a commonvocabulary (ontology), and general principles explaining the nature of complex systems’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred North Whitehead’s process philosophy is compared with Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. After briefly introducing the philosophies of Whitehead and Buddhism, some similarities between them are examined. The primary areas of convergence are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impermanence and process as fundamental aspects of reality,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the emptiness and lack of substance of things,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the relational and dependent nature of things,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the notion of ignorance and mistaken perception,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the possibility of freedom from ignorance and mistaken perception,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the emphasis on subjective and experiential aspects of reality, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fundamental limitations of language and philosophical systems in characterizing reality. The paper concludes with a discussion of an important distinguishing feature of Buddhist philosophy, namely, its dialectical method of criticism.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred North Whitehead’s major philosophical work, &lt;em&gt;Process and Reality&lt;/em&gt;, presents a complex and original metaphysical framework which is initially quite challenging to understand. This paper represents my individual efforts to understand Whitehead’s philosophy more deeply by relating it to Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. There were two main reasons why I selected Buddhist philosophy as a way of engaging Whitehead’s philosophy more deeply. First, since I had some familiarity with Buddhist philosophy, I felt that relating Whitehead’s philosophy to this existing knowledge and experience would be an effective way to integrate it into my understanding. Second, after noticing a few intriguing similarities between Whitehead’s philosophy and Buddhist philosophy, I felt drawn to see what other similarities there may be, and to what extent these similarities stand up under closer scrutiny. Although I wanted to see in what ways these philosophies might converge, at the same time I felt it was important to honour their differences, and acknowledge that some of their similarities might be only superficial resemblances. Before discussing the similarities between Whitehead’s philosophy and Buddhist philosophy, however, I will briefly introduce these philosophies separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whitehead-and-the-philosophy-of-organism&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Whitehead and the Philosophy of Organism &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/complex_systems/#whitehead-and-the-philosophy-of-organism&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) was a mathematician who later turned to philosophy. From 1900 to 1911 in Cambridge he collaborated with his former pupil Bertrand Russell on their &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt;, which attempted to deduce all of mathematics from strictly logical foundations. During the period from 1910 to 1924 Whitehead did work in the philosophy of science at the University of London and the Imperial College of Science and Technology. In 1924 at the age of 63, Whitehead accepted a position at Harvard University, where he focused on the development of his metaphysical system, which he called the philosophy of organism. Today, Whitehead’s philosophy is often referred to as process philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Whitehead, “&lt;em&gt;the actual world is a process, and...the process is the becoming of actual entities&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 22). These actual entities “&lt;em&gt;are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything more real&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 18). An actual entity is not an inert and permanent substance, but a relational process of becoming: “&lt;em&gt;how and actual entity becomes constitutes what that actual entity is. ...Its ‘being’ is constituted by its ‘becoming’&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 23). This process of becoming is a creative synthesis into one actual entity of its many relations to other actual entities. Whitehead calls the process of unification &lt;strong&gt;a concrescence of prehensions&lt;/strong&gt;, where prehensions are the ways in which other entities are taken in by, and felt within the entity, and where the concrescence is the creative process of pulling together these diverse prehensions of other actual entities into a novel, organic unity. Thus, “&lt;em&gt;actual entities involve each other by reason of their prehensions of each other&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 20). Because of this mutual co-constitution, “&lt;em&gt;you cannot abstract the universe from any entity...so as to consider that entity in complete isolation. ...In a sense, every entity pervades the whole world&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;buddhism-and-the-mahayana-school&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Buddhism and the Mahayana School &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/complex_systems/#buddhism-and-the-mahayana-school&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhism was founded in India around the 5th century BCE by Siddhartha Gautama, who is also known as the Buddha (i.e., the Awakened One). Over the course of hundreds of years, various forms of Buddhism developed and spread from India across much of East Asia. The &lt;em&gt;Theravada school of Buddhism&lt;/em&gt; is the most traditional of the various schools of Buddhism, and bases its doctrines on the original teachings of the Buddha. The various &lt;em&gt;Mahayana schools&lt;/em&gt;, in contrast, have more freely adapted and elaborated upon the historical teachings of the Buddha. All schools of Buddhism, however, share certain core doctrines. Central to the basic teaching (dharma) of Buddhism is the &lt;strong&gt;Four Noble Truths&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is suffering,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a cause of suffering,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is an end to suffering, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a path to the end of suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha taught that all experience is fundamentally impermanent in nature, and that we suffer because we habitually resist this impermanence. We crave after a permanence that cannot be found, so we inevitably suffer. By cultivating selfless compassion [ &lt;em&gt;Chesed&lt;/em&gt; ], and by reflecting and meditating on our experience, he taught that we can abandon our craving after permanence and thus attain freedom from suffering (&lt;em&gt;nirvana&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core doctrines in Buddhist philosophy is that everything exists as a dependent arising (&lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt;). According to the Buddha, all phenomena are dependent arisings, meaning not only that any process of arising is dependent upon prior causes and conditions, but also that the existence or establishment of any phenomenon is dependent upon other phenomena. In the &lt;em&gt;Madhyamika&lt;/em&gt; (“Middle Way”) school of &lt;em&gt;Mahayana Buddhism&lt;/em&gt;, the concept of dependent arising is also taken to mean that everything exists in dependence upon its own parts, and that everything exists in dependence upon the thought which designates it. In all these cases, the notion of dependent arising implies that phenomena lack independent existence. This implication is often expressed in terms of the doctrine of emptiness (&lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;): all phenomena are empty of any independent, separate essence of their own. This lack of inherent existence, however, does not imply that things do not exist at all. They do exist — but their existence is a dependent, not an independent, existence. The doctrine of dependent arising, therefore, avoids the extremes of substantialism (i.e., things exists as independent, separate essences) and nihilism (i.e., things do not exist at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependent arising is also intimately related to the &lt;strong&gt;doctrine of impermanence&lt;/strong&gt;: if things existed independent of causes and conditions, they would be permanent and unchanging; but since phenomena are impermanent and capable of change, they must arise in dependence upon causes and conditions. Another consequence of dependent arising is the law of cause and effect governing all action (&lt;em&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt;). Because all phenomena arise in dependence upon other things, all events are the effects of previous events. The moral consequence is that our intentions result in actions that have inevitable causal consequences. Unwholesome intentions and actions result in a perpetuation of suffering, while wholesome intentions and actions result in beneficial effects, culminating in liberation from the cycle of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having briefly introduced the philosophies of Whitehead and Buddhism, we will now examine some of their similarities. The primary areas of convergence that will be discussed are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impermanence and process as fundamental aspects of reality,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the emptiness and lack of substance of things,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the relational and dependent nature of things,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the notion of ignorance and mistaken perception,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the possibility of freedom from ignorance and mistaken perception,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the emphasis on subjective and experiential aspects of reality, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fundamental limitations of language and philosophical systems in characterizing reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Inada (1971, 1975) has also pointed out some similarities between Buddhism and Whitehead’s philosophy. As I will point out, however, the correspondences he makes differ in some respects from mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;process-and-impermanence&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Process and Impermanence &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/complex_systems/#process-and-impermanence&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most obvious similarity between Whitehead’s philosophy and Buddhist doctrines is that both view existence as flowing rather than static. In Buddhism, this idea is expressed in terms of the impermanence of all phenomena, the fact that our actual experience is always changing and that all phenomena arise and pass away. We never find anything constant or permanent in our experience. For Whitehead, “&lt;em&gt;the elucidation of meaning involved in the phrase ‘all things flow’ is one chief task of metaphysics&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 208). In his process philosophy, the flow or process of things takes a central place. Indeed, the final real things of the world, according to Whitehead, are actual entities (PR, p. 18), and these entities are not permanent essences, but rather processes of becoming: “&lt;em&gt;how and actual entity becomes constitutes what that actual entity is. ...Its ‘being’ is constituted by its ‘becoming’&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 23). The actual entities of reality are thus never static, but are in a process of becoming and “perpetually perishing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[NOTE: This is the basis of the game. Through the process of becoming, you enter the game. If you are successful in your becoming, then you will be able to continue. If not, you will fade away, or out.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Inada (1971) points out, however, Whitehead’s actual entities are not just processes of becoming. They also have an “objectively immortal” aspect that represents their potential for being prehended by other actual entities. An actual entity, according to Whitehead, is both a subject presiding over its own process of becoming, and a superject exercising its function of objectively immortality. These two irreducible aspects of the actual entity relate to the philosophical problem of acknowledging both permanence and change in reality. “There is not the mere problem of fluency and permanence. There is the double problem: actuality with permanence, requiring fluency as its completion; and actuality with fluency, requiring permanence as its completion” (PR, p. 347). Is there a Buddhist correlate, though, to the superject that represents the permanent aspect of reality? Inada suggests there is, since the Buddha taught not only the doctrine of impermanence, but also taught that there are certain structural features of experience, such as “the five &lt;em&gt;skandhas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;twelve _ayatanas&lt;/em&gt;, and eighteen &lt;em&gt;dhatus&lt;/em&gt;” (Inada, 1971). These experiential structures, however, do not actually correspond well with Whitehead’s notion of objective immortality. For example, consider the five components of phenomena (&lt;em&gt;skandhas&lt;/em&gt;): form and matter (&lt;em&gt;rupa&lt;/em&gt;), sensations (&lt;em&gt;vedana&lt;/em&gt;), perceptions (&lt;em&gt;sanna&lt;/em&gt;), psychic dispositions or constructions (&lt;em&gt;samkhara&lt;/em&gt;), and consciousness or conscious thought (&lt;em&gt;vinnana&lt;/em&gt;). These Buddhist structures of experience more closely resemble various phases of concrescence in the becoming of an actual entity. The objective immortality of an actual entity, on the other hand, represents the entity’s potential for prehension by other entities, not phases of its concrescence. Rather than following Inada’s suggestion, I would suggest that a more accurate Buddhist correlate to Whitehead’s concept of superject is the notion that every impermanent phenomenon, every fleeting drop of experience, does not simply disappear without any trace, but always leaves behind consequences that enter into other moments of experience. In other words, the karmic consequences of each impermanent phenomenon constitute its objective immortality. Another way of stating this is that an entity’s relatedness to other entities (i.e., its emptiness of independent existence) is its permanent aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;emptiness-and-lack-of-substance&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Emptiness and Lack of Substance &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/complex_systems/#emptiness-and-lack-of-substance&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of impermanence is intimately related to the doctrine that all things lack inherent substantiality. The Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna argued that things cannot have separate essences because this would result in an unchanging world: “&lt;em&gt;If there is essence, the whole world will be unarising, unceasing, and static. The entire phenomenal world would be immutable&lt;/em&gt;” (FWMW, p. 72). In other words, if something has its own separate essence, then it is entirely separate and without dependence upon anything else for its existence. As a result, it can never be affected or changed. Thus, if things had essences, then the whole world would be immutable and static, which is obviously false. The conclusion is that all things are empty of any such essence. This doctrine of emptiness (&lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;) is fundamental to Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. Similarly, Whitehead states that “&lt;em&gt;it is fundamental to the metaphysical doctrine of the philosophy of organism, that the notion of an actual entity as the unchanging subject of change is completely abandoned&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 29). Process philosophy departs from substance philosophy by denying any isolated, individual essence to things. The idea that things have essences is at best a useful abstraction, and at worst a profound misconception of reality: “&lt;em&gt;The simple notion of an enduring substance sustaining persistent qualities, either essentially or accidentally, expresses a useful abstract for many purposes in life. But whenever we try to use it as a fundamental statement of the nature of things, it proves itself mistaken&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 79).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important instance of this mistake is the Cartesian assumption that the human subject is a fundamental essence prior to human thought. Whitehead inverts the priority: “&lt;em&gt;The philosophy of organism...conceives the thought as a constituent operation in the creation of the occasional thinker. The thinker is the final end whereby there is the thought. In this inversion we have the final contrast between a philosophy of substance and a philosophy of organism&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 151). Similarly, a distinguishing feature of Buddhist philosophy is the doctrine of no-self (&lt;em&gt;annata&lt;/em&gt;). As Buddhist practitioner-scholar B. Alan Wallace explains, &lt;em&gt;the self “is not a physical, psychic, or spiritual substance propelled through time; rather it is a sequence of dependently related events. It is dependent upon the body and the mind that are its basis of designation, upon other causes and conditions that give rise to the present state of its continuum, and upon the mental designation of the self&lt;/em&gt;” (CR, p. 160). The self, however, is not a mere vacuity. Although it does not have an independent, separate essence, it nevertheless still has a dependent, interrelated existence. Whitehead echoes this with his statement that an actual entity is not lacking being entirely—rather, “Its ‘being’ is constituted by its ‘becoming’” (PR, p. 23). Thus, both Buddhist doctrine and Whitehead’s philosophy avoid the extremes of substantialism and nihilism, and propose that things have a relational, interdependent type of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;relational-dependent-nature-of-existence-and-causation&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Relational, Dependent Nature of Existence and Causation &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/complex_systems/#relational-dependent-nature-of-existence-and-causation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Buddhism, the emptiness and impermanence of phenomena are consequences of the fact that they are dependent arisings (&lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt;). The concept of dependent arising has several meanings. The primary meaning of dependent arising is that any process of arising is dependent upon causes and conditions. For example, the original arising of my body in my mother’s womb was dependent on various efficient causes, such as certain events that transpired nine months before my birth. The subsequent arisings of my body were also dependent on causes, such as continued food, air, and water that were necessary to sustain it. One sense of dependent arising, therefore, is the intimate efficient causal connections between things. In Whitehead’s philosophy, this is the interdependence of actual entities at the level of causal efficacy: “&lt;em&gt;The deterministic efficient causation is the inflow of the actual world.... In so far as there is negligible autonomous energy, the subject merely receives the physical feelings, confirms their valuations according to the ‘order’ of that epoch, and transmits by reason of its own objective immortality&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 245). In one of his few explicit mentions of Buddhism, Whitehead explains that &lt;em&gt;this inflow into an actual entity of physical feelings in “the initial stage of its aim is an endowment which the subject inherits from the inevitable ordering of things conceptually realized in the nature of God. ...This function of God is analogous to the remorseless working of things in Greek and Buddhist thought&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 244). In addition, the causal dependence of things on each other implies that nothing exists apart from the web of causal efficacy, and that everything contains every other thing: “&lt;em&gt;An actual entity cannot be a member of a ‘common world’ except in the sense that the ‘common world’ is a constituent of its own constitution. It follows that every item of the universe, including all the other actual entities, is a constituent in the constitution of any one actual entity&lt;/em&gt;” (PR. p. 148)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causal efficacy&lt;/strong&gt;, however, is only one of two major ways in which an actual entity prehends other actual entities: “&lt;em&gt;In each concrescence there is a twofold aspect of the creative urge. In one aspect there is the origination of simple causal feelings; and in the other aspect there is the origination of conceptual feelings. These contrasted aspects will be called the physical and the mental poles of an actual entity. No actual entity is devoid of either pole&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 239). The physical and mental poles of the actual entity, in other words, correspond to the dependence of the entity upon efficient, physical causes and upon final, conceptual causes, respectively. As Whitehead explains, “&lt;em&gt;the creative process is rhythmic: it swings from the publicity of many things to the individual privacy; and it swings back from the private individual to the publicity of the objectified individual. The former swing is dominated by the final cause, which is the ideal; and the latter swing is dominated by the efficient cause, which is actual&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 151).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already seen that dependent arising in the sense of dependence upon efficient causes is the correlate in Buddhism to Whitehead’s efficient cause that dominates the physical pole of an actual entity. Is there a Buddhist correlate to Whitehead’s final cause that dominates the mental pole of an actual entity? Indeed, a very similar idea is found in other meanings of the Buddhist concept of dependent arising. In addition to arising in dependence on efficient causes, the doctrine of dependent arising also means that things exist or are established in dependence upon conceptual designation: “&lt;em&gt;Events are dependent for their very existence upon the power of the mind and convention that designates them&lt;/em&gt;” (CR, p. 145). Thus, in addition to depending on their physical efficient causes, things also exist in dependence upon mental designation. In other words, an actual entity depends for its very determination as a particular existent upon the ingression of eternal objects through intellectual prehensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of dependent arising in Buddhism thus encompasses both physical and mental forms of prehension. Because it encompasses all the ways in which things depend upon each other, Inada (1975) suggests that this Buddhist concept is nearly identical to Whitehead’s principle of Creativity, which accounts for the integration of the plurality of actual entities into a web of interdependence. Although there is certainly a similarity between the two concepts, the Buddhist concept of dependent arising lacks the aspect of novelty that is essential to Whitehead’s principle of Creativity. In other words, the principle of Creativity implies more than just the interdependence of things — it also implies that the process of arising is an advance into novelty, and this aspect of the principle of Creativity is not present in the Buddhist doctrine of dependent arising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ignorance-and-mistaken-perception&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Ignorance and Mistaken Perception &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/complex_systems/#ignorance-and-mistaken-perception&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhism, &lt;em&gt;the root of all suffering is our ignorance of dependent arising&lt;/em&gt;. Based on this fundamental mistake, we imagine things to be permanent when they are impermanent, we imagine things to have isolated, independent existence when they are actually empty of any such independent existence, and we ignore the causal relationships between things. We then suffer when things change or pass away, or when we experience the unpleasant consequences of our prior actions. This ignorance is so deep that it is normally operative below the level of consciousness. The ultimate purpose of Buddhist practice is to become aware of this ignorance and change the habitual patterns of action that are based upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Whitehead’s philosophy did not originate in a soteriological context, it nevertheless contains ideas remarkably similar to the Buddhist doctrine of ignorance. First of all, like Buddhism, Whitehead associates the experience of suffering or evil with loss of things to the flux of becoming: “&lt;em&gt;The world is thus faced with the paradox that, at least in its higher actualities, it craves for novelty and yet is haunted by terror at the loss of the past, with its familiarities and its loved ones. It seeks escape from time in its character of ‘perpetually perishing’&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 340) “&lt;em&gt;The ultimate evil in the temporal world...lies in the fact that the past fades, that time is a ‘perpetual perishing’&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 340). Although both Buddhism and Whitehead associate evil and suffering with impermanence, they differ in that Whitehead roots evil in the impermanence itself, while Buddhist doctrine roots suffering not so much in impermanence but in our failure to come to terms with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another similarity between the Buddhist doctrine of ignorance and Whitehead’s philosophy is the idea that our normal conscious experience is mistaken or delusive. In Buddhism, due to our deep ignorance of dependent arising, we habitually perceive things as if they were separate essences. This mistaken perception, says Nagarjuna, is intimately related to the fact that we do not see the causal connections between things: “&lt;em&gt;If you perceive the existence of all things in terms of their essence, then this perception of all things will be without the perception of causes and conditions&lt;/em&gt;” (FWMW, p. 69) [Chokhmah]. Whitehead presents a very similar view. For him, the more fundamental relational prehensions in the mode of causal efficacy are no longer apparent at the derivative level of presentational immediacy associated with normal consciousness: “&lt;em&gt;The former mode [of causal efficacy] produces percepta which are vague, not to be controlled, heavy with emotion: it produces a sense of derivation from an immediate past, and of passage to an immediate future. ...The percepta in the mode of presentational immediacy have the converse characteristics. In comparison, they are distinct, definite, controllable, apt for immediate enjoyment, and with the minimum of reference to past, or to future&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, pp. 178-179). In other words, the distinct, definite, and isolated percepta of presentational immediacy are created by a process of ignoring the interdependence of things at the level of causal efficacy. “&lt;em&gt;Consciousness is only the last and greatest of such (formative) elements by which the selective character of the individual obscures the external totality from which it originates and which it embodies&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 15). The result of this obscuration is that “&lt;em&gt;consciousness only dimly illuminates the prehensions in the mode of causal efficacy&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 162).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the level of causal efficacy is ignored, the abstract, derivative percepta of presentational immediacy are mistaken as being the original concrete aspects of experience. This “&lt;strong&gt;‘fallacy of misplaced concreteness’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;...consists in neglecting the degree of abstraction involved when an actual entity is considered merely so far as it exemplifies certain categories of thought. There are aspects of actualities which are simply ignored so long as we restrict thought to these categories.&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 7). These ignored aspects of actualities are exactly their dependence upon causes and conditions. Thus, &lt;em&gt;the fallacy of misplaced concreteness is none other than the ignorance of the truth of dependent arising&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;freedom-and-emancipation&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Freedom and Emancipation &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/complex_systems/#freedom-and-emancipation&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha taught that it is possible to become free of suffering by cutting the root of our ignorance. This is possible because the truth of dependent arising implies that our very habits of ignorance are themselves impermanent, and thus all sentient beings will ultimately be liberated. In the Buddhist context, this liberation cannot be attained by mere intellectual understanding. It requires a profound transformation of the mind, typically over many years of contemplative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitehead’s philosophy was not created as a religious philosophy, as Buddhism was, with an explicitly soteriological purpose. Nevertheless, Whitehead does state that philosophy should reveal what has been obscured, and should serve to correct our mistaken perceptions: “&lt;em&gt;Philosophy is the self-correction by consciousness of its own initial excess of subjectivity. ...The task of philosophy is to recover the totality obscured by the selection [of consciousness]. It replaces in rational experience what has been submerged in the higher sensitive experience and has been sunk yet deeper by the initial operations of consciousness itself&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 15). In other words, the propositions of philosophy represent in rational experience what has been ignored or obscured by consciousness. Transformation is then effected by the inherent power of propositions as a lure for feeling at a deeper experiential level: “&lt;em&gt;The proposition becomes a lure for the conditioning of creative action. In other words, its prehension effects a modification of the subjective aim&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 273). Thus, the possibility of our own transformation is based on the creative ingression of intellectual feelings above and beyond physical prehensions in the mode of causal efficacy. “&lt;em&gt;The doctrine of the philosophy of organism is that, however far the sphere of efficient causation be pushed in the determination of components of a concrescence... beyond the determination of these components there always remains a final reaction of the self-creative unity of the universe&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 47). Whitehead’s name for this unity is the &lt;strong&gt;primordial nature of God&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition to providing us with our potentiality for creative transformation, the consequent nature of God is also “the great companion — the fellow-sufferer who understands” (PR, p. 351). Inada (1975) suggests that the Buddha or Tathagata corresponds to the primordial nature of God, while the Bodhisattva corresponds to &lt;em&gt;the consequent nature of God, whose purpose is the attainment of value and intensity of feeling in the temporal world&lt;/em&gt;. This correspondence seems accurate insofar as the Bodhisattva is dedicated to compassionate action in the world for the benefit of all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva, however, is not God but a highly evolved sentient being. As for the correspondence between the Buddha and the primordial nature of God, this would be more accurately stated as the correspondence between Buddha nature and the primordial nature of God, since the Buddha Gautama was also not God but an awakened sentient being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to materialistic philosophies of substance, &lt;em&gt;both Buddhist and process philosophies take reality to be fundamentally experiential in nature&lt;/em&gt;. Whitehead leaves little room for doubt in his position on this matter: “&lt;em&gt;apart from the experiences of subjects there is nothing, nothing, nothing, bare nothingness&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 167). In addition, Whitehead’s “&lt;em&gt;final real things&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 18), &lt;em&gt;the actual entities&lt;/em&gt;, are described as “&lt;em&gt;drops of experience&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 18). As for Buddhism, as a contemplative religious tradition, experience is the ultimate ground of reality. Beyond the common importance given to experience, Whitehead and the Buddha also shared a similar view regarding the relationship between philosophy and experience. For both, experience is the touchstone of truth for any philosophical system or concept. As Whitehead expressed it, “&lt;em&gt;whatever is found in ‘practice’ must lie within the scope of the metaphysical description. When the description fails to include the ‘practice,’ the metaphysics is inadequate and requires revision&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 13). As for Buddhism, the practitioner is told to test the doctrines against experience, and not blindly take them for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;limits-of-concepts-and-philosophical-systems&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Limits of Concepts and Philosophical Systems &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/complex_systems/#limits-of-concepts-and-philosophical-systems&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhist philosophy is formulated as a means to the end of liberation from suffering, and not as a final dogmatic metaphysical system. Although Whitehead’s philosophy was not formulated for explicitly religious purposes, he still has a similar attitude toward dogmatism: “&lt;em&gt;In philosophic discussion, the merest hint of dogmatic certainty as to finality of statement is an exhibition of folly&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. xiv). Whitehead and Buddhism also share a similar view of the limitations inherent in language. In Buddhism, the ultimate truth is ineffable, and cannot be formulated or expressed in thought or concept. As for Whitehead, he assures us that “&lt;em&gt;philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles. Weakness of insight and deficiencies of language stand in the way inexorably&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 4). “&lt;em&gt;Language, in its ordinary usages, penetrates but a short distance into the principles of metaphysics&lt;/em&gt;” (PR, p. 167).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddha and Whitehead, however, had different responses to these limitations of philosophy and language. For Whitehead, it implied that metaphysics was always subject to revision in light of deeper experience, insight, and understanding. The Buddha went further, though, to assert that it is possible to experience truth in an immediate, non-conceptual way. “&lt;em&gt;It is possible to experience a reality that transcends all conceptual frameworks once one’s mind is freed from all conceptualization. When first abiding in such a realization, one has no awareness of conventional reality at all. As one proceeds to full awakening, the challenge is to integrate this profound insight with one’s experience of relative truth, in all its diversity&lt;/em&gt;” (CR, p. 150). This incomprehensible, integrated wisdom is appreciative of the unique value of each particular standpoint, and at the same time is not limited to any one point of view. It is even acknowledged that the Buddhist dharma itself cannot be put forward as an absolute truth. As the teaching of the way to end suffering, the Buddhist teaching is therefore not independently established as a final, absolute truth, but is rather a compassionate, responsive, dependent arising in relation to ignorance and suffering. To cling on to the Buddhist doctrines as absolutes, therefore, is inconsistent with the most fundamental principles at the basis of those very doctrines. In the words of Nagarjuna (FWMW, p. 83):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I prostrate to Gautama
Who through compassion
Taught the true doctrine,
Which leads to the relinquishing of all views.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-critical-difference&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;A Critical Difference &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/complex_systems/#a-critical-difference&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Whitehead’s philosophy, Buddhist philosophy embodies a critical dialectical method that dynamically turns upon its own categories and doctrines. The Indian Buddhist sage Nagarjuna (circa 2nd Century, CE) applied this technique to the various categories of thought in Buddhist philosophy, with the goal of freeing the mind from clinging to philosophical constructs. Through subtle dialectical argument, Nagarjuna demonstrated that any concept or philosophical position, if taken as final and absolute, ultimately leads to logical contradiction. The successful application of this technique reveals that the concept or position is empty of any final or ultimate truth. Because the same technique can be used to show that the opposite concept or position is also empty of any final or ultimate truth, the result is that both extremes of thought are abandoned, revealing a middle way between extremes of dogmatic assertion and dogmatic rejection. Nagarjuna’s dialectical technique applied to phenomena of experience as well as to philosophical views shows that when reality is rigorously and carefully examined, no permanent, absolute, or independent entity, existence, or conceptual truth is found. This &lt;em&gt;“not-finding” is the discovery of emptiness&lt;/em&gt;. It is not a positive conclusion or new experiential phenomenon, but a non-conceptual insight regarding what is not actually present in the nature of experience.&lt;br /&gt;
The dialectical process does not even end there. If the discovery of emptiness is itself grasped and reduced to a conceptual conclusion or final experience, then Nagarjuna’s method can be applied again to reveal the emptiness of this object of grasping (i.e., the emptiness of emptiness). Another very subtle form of grasping can take place when Nagarjuna’s critical technique is itself grasped onto as a final truth. A consistent application of the dialectical method then will reveal that the technique is itself dependent on grasping. If there is no grasping to extremes, there can be no criticism. Therefore, even Nagarjuna’s own technique is empty. The dialectical method, therefore, has the ultimate effect of undermining itself, just as the successful application of any medicine will result in a state of health wherein the medicine is no longer useful. If there is no fixity or grasping, then Nagarjuna’s method is unnecessary, just a medicine is no longer necessary after an illness is cured. As long as we are poisoned with habits of grasping and suffer its consequences, however, the medicine of emptiness is relevant and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, to the extent that Whitehead’s philosophy has medicinal powers to dispel our ignorance of dependent arising, it is essentially in harmony with the spirit of the Buddhist teachings, even if it differs in some of its details. In spite of their differences, however, there are many significant similarities between these two philosophies. It is my hope that this paper will foster deeper understanding of both Whitehead’s process philosophy and Buddhist teachings, and help all sentient beings in their creative advance toward Buddhahood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego separates, spirit seeks union&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego is static, spirit is dynamic, always in motion.&lt;br /&gt;
Like form and force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breath is air in motion,&lt;br /&gt;
breath of the Divine is the motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Something moves in spirit, a need to enter the sacred path of union:
Union with the Beloved, is in the upper realms.
Union with one another occurs in the middle realms.
And finally, sexual union, is fed from the lower realm.

Yet it is the space from which life emerges.

Oh, simple being,
you are called to the darkness,
for there you find life.
Not another alone,
but your own.

Only in the depths of existence,
Yours, can you find the Source.
For G-d remains hidden
in plain sight.
We just have to learn to
see.

Sometimes the path awaits, and
like a lightning bolt, descends
upon you, and you awaken (or not).

Most times we trudge, step by step,
day by day, moment by moment, searching,
hoping, praying, calling, braying
like lost sheep.

Then, for those who can be quiet,
in the precious moments of peace,
perhaps the Voice is heard - for ears
do not have to be taught to hear,
like eyes to see.

It is a Siren call - full of life
and lust. You have to follow it -
and it will always lead you to sin
where you are blessed to with the sacred gift
of choice...

Choose the darkness, and it will with remain with you
until you are worthy or &amp;quot;[lucky](mazal.html)&amp;quot; to being blessed again.

Choose the light, and it will remain with you,
as long as you are worthy.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;!-- TODO:
https://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/theology-philosophy/hartshorn-development-of-process-philosophy/
--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the material is taken from the Stanford University Philosophy Library that has been made available to the general public. It&#39;s article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/(https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/)&quot;&gt;Process philosophy&lt;/a&gt; is clear, and well-written. For now it serves our purposes, and was used to form this version. Much apppreciation to SU. Seems to have been taken from [Stanford University entry on Process Philosophy].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;process-philosophy&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Process Philosophy &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#process-philosophy&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process philosophy is as dramatic a shift in view as the shift from a geocentric to a solar-centric solar system heralded by Galileo and Copernicus. It&#39;s eventual effect was to shift the pre-eminance of religious power to allow secular, scientific beliefs to have a powerful influence on our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has shifted our viewpoint from being purely anthropomorphic, placing humankind at the centre of the universe - the spiritual one, that is - to being a &amp;quot;merely&amp;quot; a player in the Divine Cosmic Drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is similar to projective geometry, which looks at the geometrical object from the outside-in, rather than the inside-out, by deriving it from the viewpoint of infinity, rather from the viewpoint of the finite observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we look at first at the events that produce us - rather than describing the perception we have of the events that occur around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamic&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Dynamic &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#dynamic&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process philosophy is based on the premise that being is dynamic and that the dynamic nature of being should be the primary focus of any comprehensive philosophical account of reality and our place within it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the first and most important characteristic of process philosophy is that it is &lt;strong&gt;dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we experience our world and ourselves as continuously changing, Western metaphysics has long been obsessed with describing reality as an assembly of static individuals whose dynamic features are either taken to be mere appearances or ontologically secondary and derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;process&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Process &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#process&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process is a basic entity that is individuated in terms of what it ‘does.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to develop a taxonomy of dynamic beings (types and modes of occurrences), &lt;em&gt;processists replace the descriptive concepts of substance metaphysics with a set of new basic &lt;strong&gt;categories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Central among these is the notion of a basic entity that is individuated in terms of what it ‘does.’ This type of functionally individuated entity is often labelled ‘&lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt;’ in a technical sense of this term that does not coincide with our common-sense notion of a process. Some of the ‘processes’ postulated by process philosophers are in agreement with our common-sense understanding of processes — temporal developments that can be analysed as temporally structured sequences of stages of an occurrence, with each such stage being numerically and qualitatively different from any other. But some of the ‘processes’ that process philosophers operate with are not temporal developments in this sense — they are, for example, temporal but non-developmental occurrences like activities, or non-spatiotemporal happenings that realize themselves in a developmental fashion and thereby constitute the directionality of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What holds for all dynamic entities labelled ‘processes,’ however, is that they occur—that they are somehow or other intimately connected to time, and often, though not necessarily, related to the directionality or the passage of time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;form&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Form &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#form&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While process philosophers insist that all within and about reality is continuously going on and coming about, they do not deny that there are temporally stable and reliably recurrent aspects of reality. But they take such aspects of persistence to be the regular behaviour of dynamic organizations that arise due to the continuously ongoing interaction of processes.&lt;/em&gt; These are referred to as &lt;strong&gt;Points of Stability&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to articulate a process view of reality, special theoretical efforts are required, however, since the standard theoretical tools of Western metaphysics are geared to the static view of reality. Especially the standard interpretation of predicate logic in terms of static individuals with properties that are exemplified timelessly or at a temporal instant consolidates what is from the process-philosophical perspective an unhelpful theoretical bias. This has forced upon process philosophy a double role as metaphysical and metaphilosophical enterprise—pushing for a paradigm change, process philosophy has the double task of developing new explanatory concepts and providing arguments for why these concepts better serve the aims of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;becoming&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Becoming &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#becoming&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some process accounts, &lt;strong&gt;becoming&lt;/strong&gt; is the mode of being common to the many kinds of occurrences or dynamic beings. Other process accounts hold that being is ongoing &lt;strong&gt;self-differentiation&lt;/strong&gt;; on these accounts becoming is both the mode of being of different kinds of dynamic beings and the process that generates different kinds of dynamic beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;constant-becoming&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Constant becoming &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#constant-becoming&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process philosophy&#39;s concern is with the dynamic sense of being as becoming or occurrence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions of spatio-temporal existence, the kinds of dynamic entities, the relationship between mind and world, and the realization of values in action are all under discussion.The wide range of approaches to the subject share the guiding idea that natural existence consists in modes of becoming and types of occurrences. ‘Processists’ agree that the world is an assembly of physical, organic, social, and cognitive processes that interact at and across levels of dynamic organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;substance-metaphysics&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Substance Metaphysics &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#substance-metaphysics&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process philosophy opposes substance metaphysics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substance metaphysics has been the dominant research paradigm in the history of Western philosophy since Aristotle. &lt;em&gt;Substance metaphysics proceeds from the intuition&lt;/em&gt; — first formulated by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher &lt;strong&gt;Parmenides&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;em&gt;that being should be thought of as simple, hence as internally undifferentiated and unchangeable&lt;/em&gt;. Substance metaphysicians recast this intuition as &lt;em&gt;the claim that the primary units of reality (called “substances”) must be static — they must be what they are at any instant in time&lt;/em&gt; (time invariant). &lt;em&gt;In contrast to the substance-metaphysical &lt;strong&gt;snapshot view of reality&lt;/strong&gt;, with its typical focus on eternalist being and on what there is, process philosophers analyse becoming and what is occurring as well as ways of occurring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;process-metaphysics&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Process Metaphysics &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/process_philosophy/#process-metaphysics&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we admit that the basic entities of our world are processes, we can generate better philosophical descriptions of all the kinds of entities and relationships we are committed to when we reason about our world in common sense and in science:&lt;/em&gt; from quantum entanglement to consciousness, from computation to feelings, from things to institutions, from organisms to societies, from traffic jams to climate change, from spacetime to beauty. &lt;em&gt;Moreover, results in cognitive science, some philosophers have claimed, show that we need a process metaphysics in order to develop a naturalist theory of the mind and of normativity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bias towards substances seems to be rooted partly in the cognitive dispositions of speakers of Indo-European languages, and partly in theoretical habituation, as the traditional prioritization of static entities (substances, objects, states of affairs, static structures) at the beginning of Western metaphysics built on itself. In contrast, process philosophy shows fewer affinities to any particular language group and can allude to a rich tradition of reflection in many of the great schools of Eastern thought. As recently appeared, process philosophy also has an increasing practical dimension, since &lt;em&gt;only if we re-visualize our world as a system of interactions can we come to grips, conceptually and ethically, with the new phenomena of artificial life, artificial intelligence, and artificial sociality, and investigate the exceptionality of human capacities and the scope of moral obligation&lt;/em&gt;. Thus contemporary &lt;em&gt;process philosophy holds out the promise of offering superior support for the three most pressing tasks of philosophy at the beginning of the 21st century&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides the category-theoretic tools for an integrated metaphysics that can join our common sense and scientific images of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can serve as a theoretical platform upon which to build an intercultural philosophy and to facilitate interdisciplinary research on global knowledge representation by means of an ontological framework that is no longer parochially Western.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It supplies concepts that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration on reflected technology development, and enable the cultural and ethical imagination needed to shape the expectable deep socio-cultural changes engendered by the increased use of technology, especially automation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear is the killer – but must be tempered with discernment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Think a new thought.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dare to dream. And never stop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;There is always a place of balance – the fulcrum upon which the two opposites rest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my life I have been studying the ancient and modern texts of Judaism and Kabbalah. Combined with my mathematical background, and life-long fascination with the Quantum view. I have arrived at a four-dimensional, many-words view of the world, a view I call Quantum Kabbalah.&lt;br /&gt;
This is derived from the insight that perhaps QP &amp;amp; Kab are talking about the same realm, just using different language to describe it. Just as many claim that all religions are talking about the same God, or Divine realm, using different language and symbols to express this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the midst of this, studying texts translated from the Hebrew - with which I am familiar – to English, I had the insight that perhaps both QP &amp;amp; Kab were speaking about the same things – just different language and symbols. The exciting part of this was that the “other” language was mathematics, while the former was Hebrew – neither of which was English, my mother tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the possibility that QP &amp;amp; Kab might actually be speaking about the same realm, I ask the question – what shared characteristics can I identify?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My method is one I call &lt;strong&gt;Pure Narcissism&lt;/strong&gt;, where the only point of reference is you, yourself – what we call self-referential. The point of interaction, one dimensional, a thought, a feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word narcissism has been perverted by modern psychology, based entirely on Freud’s idea of this particular human characteristic. I would like to use it in a pre-Freudian sense, and interpret it from its origins – the myth of Narcissus, the Greek youth who became enamoured by his own reflection in the water... and died. Which, by the way, is only one of the ways, most appealing in a grotesque manner, in which this could play out. And, as most of these Greek myths are, this is another of those love stories. Narcissus, rejecting Echo’s love, while pining for his twin sister. Echo, in the meantime has rejected Pan’s love, etc. etc. etc. The Greek gods definitely show basic, and ugly, human traits. And a basic tenet of our culture is that God is good, or for a human to believe in God is to strive to improve himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my interpretation, Narcissism is a topic that discusses human self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my investigations into the material is identification of other as self. An empathic procedure and place yourself into the situation that you are exploring and trying to understand more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;vibrational-space&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Vibrational space &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/pure_narcissism/#vibrational-space&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God spoke to us it would be with a wave/vibration. In it’s most basic form, all it needs is to be different, and then there can be communication.”Speaks/waters” . Need to hear the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/pure_narcissism/chashmal.md&quot;&gt;Chashmal&lt;/a&gt;. “Feel” the electricity (in the air) when there is excitement =&amp;gt; eroticism (excitement/fear -&amp;gt; awe/fear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine there was a vibrational frequency in the universe that we could reach, but not our instruments. Think of our instruments to measure and read this interaction – which on the most subtle level we call entanglement. They are human made, and thus suffer the imperfections and limitations of humans. Whereas we are divinely constructed, or at very least constructed by the same mind/ability, whether “nature” or something else, to be able to detect subtle frequencies that we cannot build machines to detect. -----&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Merkavah&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an expression of “the waters cannot rise above their source”. Or the music heard can only be as good as the source played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Know that all the word sof this text are merely symbols (or representations) of the spiritual objects that they represent.&lt;/em&gt; (Talmud Eser Sefirot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could not this be the case, except for our souls. Though our bodies might be the representation of our souls – the spiritual object referred to here. Once again, could a wolf not be the representation of a wolf spirit, and the mountain a mountain spirit and the stars, star beings, etc. etc?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything material degrades, atom by atom. The universal mind, however, is unconcerned as to how long it takes, because it is beyond time and beyond space, being itself infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, though, are bound in time. Thus we see it as a process, and we need to slow down during our lives, in order to extend the time of life. In fact, of any material (and some immaterial) object – your house, machines, you life, your love, your wealth, etc. Because only by slowing down, could we being to appreciate what we do have, and begin to be grateful. It is the difference between passing through life seeing from the window of a passing vehicle – drive-by tourism, or walking through the villages and countryside, with its smells and sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the bliss that you would enjoy spending one evening in love, or doing what you love. How it is timeless and often seems to last forever. Every moment is precious, every memory sweet. That only comes from a type of stillness, a slowing down – not through any fast racing by, on the way to the next thing. How bizarre that is, that the only way one can gain time is by slowing down... for time is not absolute (except in the minds of men), or to say that better, time is not the same experience for each one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our purpose is to make peace with this dynamic, this paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we remove time, it produces a feeling of fullness. If we remove space, one of emptiness. These are the doorways to a meeting with G!d or the mind of G!d.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradoxical nature of life&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/pure_narcissism/narcissism.png&quot;&gt;Paradoxical nature of life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever we move from the mundance to spiritual realms, there is a change of density – a “bending” of the light. Just as light entering water bends, so does the energy as it moves from one realm to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Dim: In dimensional terms, when one looks at a 2d line from 3d, the space of perception has changed. From being planar to spherical. So it would change from a 4th dim perspective. Or more clearly, a circle in 2d becomes a sphere in 3d and a hypersphere in 4d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or one can think of it as looking at oneself, or an event through a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_Left is right, and right is left. _&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What is up, is down,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and what is down must come up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called the “crossing”, for it is the only way to understand what happens when you cross the gap between the perceived and the occurrence, between the cause and the effect, the beginning and the end. And is symbolised as + in 2d, and X in 3d&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
God is one half of the circle, the first half, the beginning. We need to complete the circle.&lt;br /&gt;
Light enters that circle, and Life begins. In Kabbalah, Life and Light are the same things. When it is spiritual, it is referred to as Light. When it is manifest/mundane, it is called Life. Simply, you could think of the circle as emerging, and still. God, the infinite being, is all of it - the circle, the space inside and outside of the circle. But something moves, and the circle begins to turn – or rather, energy flows down the one side of the circle, or, even better, the one side of the circle is energised. Think of it as a pendulum that has just enough energy to reach its nexus, but no more. It will need an extra push, some miraculous energy, to crest the top and return to its rest state at the bottom. Interesting enough, this nexus is a zero, or balance point too. In other words, the pendulum will stay a moment at its crest, before descending down, if it has enough energy to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, using the principle of the crossing, where up is down, the light descends till it reaches this place of existence, where life is manifest. It has just enough to cause it to reach this nexus, this zero-point, and then it is up to us to provide the energy for it to rise again. Use the pendulum image to understand this. Just turn it upside-down!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, though the dynamic that we are an expression of, is one whose impetus is downwards, it is up to us to invoke the will to rise up to complete the circle. This is called “influence from below”. As the Kabbalists say, “We are part of God’s healing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kabbalah, creation is spoken of as a circle that extends equally in all directions, and is thus called balanced. Then the Holy Ari speaks of the Light of the Divine like a ray that enters this circle. We have a much richer vocabulary today. We can think of the 10 phases as dimensions, and thus understand how they are intertwined. For each higher dimension can be expressed in terms of a lower one. Yet it also speaks of this as a lightning bolt that descends via the sefirot, until it manifests in Malchut, the Kingdom, the manifest realm. However, we can only return via the central pillar, like an arrow that ascends or climb the ladder of discipline and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us have this urge to rise above, embrace more, than just the mundance aspects of life. All philosphers, mystics and geniuses of all ilk have sought to penetrate, in one fashion or another, the mind of G!d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly many have reached hight levels of consciousness and amazing understandings and perception of the world around us. Yet were they truly enlightened, as the Son of God, or Satori, or Moslem Heaven – and is that the space that their consciousness was speaking from? Or were they still seeking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judaism doesn’t even have such a concept, except that of prophecy – which no one knows how that was obtained, except that it ended with the demise of the last red heifer) – and of a meeting with God in the Throne room. But no state of enlightment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We end up with religion entering a stote of mind that would enable us to “receive” and accept the Messiah. Who will arise? Chosen by us, or God, or by himself or by the earthly powers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for what purpose, I ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the glorification of God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or power over mundanes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding our purpose?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help humanity as a whole?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because you are called, have a driving, insatiable, deep need to understand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find fulfilment, peace (shalom)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because that’s just who you are and what you want to be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have future sight, you cannot speak of it to anyone (unless told to). If you have to speak of it, speak of it not more than 2. If you can explain or teach it, do not teach it to more than one person. For, the very nature of prophecy is an act which changes the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seldom is prophecy speaking of the only possible future. Prophecy only become prophetic in the fulfillment of the prophecy. And the title of pophet is only bestowed on those who already have a history of predicting the future. Thus a prophet is deemed a prophet by having experiencing his or her ability to predict events. In our tradition, there is only one prophecy - that of the coming of the Messianic age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many interpretations of the word Clairvoyant, but the one I want to work with here, is the one that literally means &amp;quot;Clear vision&amp;quot;, because clairvoyance is a form of shamanism. It is a shaman who can see clearly. See what clearly... why the other world (or worlds) around us. I, for one, have experienced another reality - a so-called death experience - and since, am not sure if the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; realities I have encountered are just parts of the first, or are really different realities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is a fundamental process/property of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could think of consciousness as self-aware energy, and self-aware energy is energy that is aware of the information it is receiving and transmitting - to a lessor or greater degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to express it in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/energy/dimensions.html&quot;&gt;dimensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above idea might open one to the theories of &lt;em&gt;panpsychism&lt;/em&gt;, which says that even a rock has consciousness. It exists as a rock, with all the characteristics of rock, but is it self-aware?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a theory, a cosmology, wrapped in a practice and the living expression of an ancient tradition, in which consciousness IS the fundamental property of the universe, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/energy/kabbalah_intro.html&quot;&gt;kabbalah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before energy release, there is the greatest pressure. That is due to the fact that it has to reach critical mass/density/energy in order to have enough force to expand or replicate - which is an organic way to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective tools of the &lt;em&gt;Sitra Ahara&lt;/em&gt;, the &amp;quot;Other Side&amp;quot;, Satan, is to keep us bus with the mundane aspects of our lives, thus leaving no space for the Divine. All relationships need attention to flourish. If there is no time for a relationship with the Father, than eventually the two of you will become somewhat estranged and unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two types of measuring instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;real&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Real &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/energy/#real&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which measures real things, with real measuring tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in order be able to measure, need a measuring tool (let&#39;s call it a ruler)&lt;br /&gt;
this tool has to be crafted to a certain agreed standards of measurement (cm, in, etc).&lt;br /&gt;
in this case, measurement is a kind of standard that everyone has agreed to, so that it can be &amp;quot;traded&amp;quot; quantitatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;virtual&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Virtual &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/energy/#virtual&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which measures measured things with complex data collection tools, that then require sophisticated mathematics to solve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, we have another virtual (one could almost say esoteric) field of measurement, which is far more intricate and complex than that of our normal empirical way of measuring that we are used to. It requires us to construct complex measuring devices (they have may names: Particle accelerator, etc), and even more complex mathematics to &amp;quot;measure&amp;quot; them. The problem here is not the agreement of standards - which we already have from our empirical measuring instruments - like weight, length, speed, etc. It is more that we are not sure what we are measuring - or if our methods of calculation are valid - but they work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a simple example. If I know that the answer to the problem is 13. Everyone ponders possible solutions to the problem. The along comes Prof. Dumbledee, and proves that 1 + 5 + 7 = 13. Everyone is ecstatic, and he is greatly honoured for that insight. Even more honour is heaped upon me when I show that it can predict outcomes. In other words, if I have it and find another 5 of them. Then gathering another 7, I show that I then have a 13! Everybody is celebrating this giant leap forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then along come Prof. Doodledee and shows that if I take just 4 of them, and then put another 9 into the equation, I also get 13. What a disruption this causes. Does that mean that it is different? Do we have two 13&#39;s then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when we get confused between the virtual and the real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-measurement&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Human measurement &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/energy/#human-measurement&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, we have two types of experiences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;real:-form&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Real: Form &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/energy/#real:-form&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can be measured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can be uniquely identified (time/space)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;imaginary:-wave&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Imaginary: Wave &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/energy/#imaginary:-wave&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wave is an imaginary mapping of the sensation that you feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sensation can only be measured/experienced when it causes an observable (measurable) change in some recognisable (measurable) characteristic of an identified (measurable) object. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/energy/entanglement.html&quot;&gt;entanglement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the more subtle the wave/sensation, the more sensitive a measuring instrument is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a wave becomes &lt;strong&gt;entangled&lt;/strong&gt; (either with enough other waves) or a &amp;quot;standing wave&amp;quot; or particle/object, then it is recognised as a particle. And we call it &amp;quot;the collapse of the wave (function)&amp;quot;. Thus a wave can only be &amp;quot;experienced/measured&amp;quot; when it interacts with something, and causes some change in the state of the &amp;quot;observer&amp;quot; (or object of or under investigation).&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Armageddon</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;armageddon-(tolnet)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Armageddon (TolNet) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/call/#armageddon-(tolnet)&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you realise what is happening? It is the time of Armageddon, when the baby will be torn from the arms of the screaming mother, and the child will not be able to be with his parent when the time comes for her to pass over; when congerations will no longer be able to meet and share in communial gatherings to pray to their gods and their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is strange that the story of the Exodus of the Jewish people from their bondage in Egypt starts off with the Pharoah&#39;s refusal to allow them to go into the wilderness to pray to their Gods. It is like a Christian not being given the day off for Xmas - oh, darn, I forgot, that already happens in the Christian countries themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will become the pariah&#39;s of society, the hated, and the feared. For we are not &amp;quot;innoculated&amp;quot; against the dreaded disease of non-compliance to the regime. What regime am I talking of here? It is the medical regime - science and health seem to be on a path to extermination. This medical health regime had become a cancer on the body social. It only knows it own needs and appetites - driven by our fear of death, and the need for control of our destiny (another death avoiding strategy). However, to avoid death is to avoid life. Death is an intrinsic aspect of life, and cannot be seperated. When your time comes... we say. And now this &amp;quot;scientific revolution&amp;quot; (against who is science rebelling? It seems, in the end, against G-d. Science believes [yes - believes, like the religious zealot believes] that we are here to improve on G-d&#39;s design, although it does not acknowledge the existence of G-d, claiming that there is no emperical proof of G-d. It is like the idiot looking at the elephant in the room, and asking &amp;quot;What elephant&amp;quot;. Is it so big that we cannot see it? Is it not so obvious that it does not, nay cannot be proven. Just as the question of whether the set of all sets is itself as set, the obvious reality in which we are born is a prededermined environment. It was here long before I was born, and will be here long after I am dead. So, It Itself is a &amp;quot;something&amp;quot;, even if just an existence. Though, if it has taken us, with our vaunted intelligence so many &amp;quot;thousands&amp;quot; of years to understand the little of what is going on around us that we do at present understand, whatever inhabits this universe, and designed it so explicitly, must &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; something we don&#39;t, something fundamental to this existence. And as such, is at the very least, a superior form of intelligence.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/#threes&quot;&gt;Three(s)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/#sovereignty--empowerment&quot;&gt;Sovereignty ~ empowerment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/#3-shapes&quot;&gt;3 shapes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/#as-above-so-below&quot;&gt;As above, so below&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/#energy-is-energy---good-or-bad&quot;&gt;Energy is energy - good or bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;three(s)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Three(s) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/#three(s)&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/trinity.png&quot; alt=&quot;trinity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 states, 3 responses, 3 reactions: positive, negative &amp;amp; neutral; for, against, not-sure; pro, anti, on the fence; beginning (1), end (infinity), middle (which forms the bulk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ways to deal with the middle: Excluded middle (used mainly in mathematics, and logic, and fascist regimes), or the included middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the boundaries of the space are defined (expressed) by the extremes (or the limits/boundaries). Thus is it the extremists, what we call the fanatics, or zealots, that pull society this way or that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sovereignty-~-empowerment&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sovereignty ~ empowerment &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/#sovereignty-~-empowerment&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no real sovereignty. The only real sovereign is G-d. The only earthly sovereignty we experience, is as power over. What we can seek only in the societal environment, is &amp;quot;empowerment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-shapes&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;3 shapes &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/#3-shapes&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every object produces at least three shapes: inner, outer and the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inner represents the observer, the I, and the outer represents there the observed, the situation. The border, or skin, demarcates a field of transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute and total stillness&lt;/strong&gt;: If something is still, it cannot be observed. Thus everything can be measured/perceived if and when it moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-above-so-below&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;As above, so below &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/#as-above-so-below&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As above, so below&lt;br /&gt;
Yet there must be differences, otherwise they would be indistinguishable – unless they are separated by a brane, a curtain or barrier that keeps them separate, though they are the same. Perhaps there is a difference, but they are so intertwined in one space, that it is impossible to tell where the one begins and the other ends. However, locally, there is a difference, so we can return to the idea that there is a difference, and/or some sort of separation between the Upper and the Lower.&lt;br /&gt;
U,L : They are not equal&lt;br /&gt;
L subset of U: However, is L completely contained in U?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/trinity/above-below.png&quot;&gt;Diagram 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps it behaves more like the photons in the double slit experiment, where each ray can follow any path to the upper realm, but collapses to certain one’s because of what the consciousness in the lower realm is “observing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if it is true that AASB, then we cannot look to the upper realms for help as they must be in the same chaotic and unsafe state that we are in. Appealing to “them”, the U, is useless. We have to solve our own problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, if there are differences between U &amp;amp; L, what are they?&lt;br /&gt;
One is that U has info that is essential for us to “heal” ourselves – and attain our inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[This is where they connect. What is the point, the primal point of what you are doing, or the event, or the words you use? Are they feeding the upper realms, or strengthening the Lower? Our sages say that good is a choice, while evil is natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the ability, nay, the incredible gift and responsibility to affect each and everyone’s life by taking control of our own lives. Whatever one says regarding us, as human beings, whatever the comparisons one makes with the stars or the beasts, with virii or computers, we are the only living beings that are able to are consciously conscious, as far as we know. We are the only one’s we know of that make conscious and premeditated steps to control our behaviour. Even a star has no say in its destiny. The sages call this “free will”, and say that we always have a choice to do good – which generally entails going against our “natural” desires, and shaping them consciously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; dimensional being, you are constantly aware of each one of these realms of interaction - from 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; (and even 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine each moment of interaction (action -&amp;gt; reaction) as a supernova that spews out material as it bursts into light. A light so bright that it traverses infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that vantage point, it looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the depth of my being rises the impulse. With enough power and faith, it bursts forth and engages the other. At that tangential moment/pt of contact, the “shock wave” spreads out in all directions, proportional to the impact/power of the interaction.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;It could be fleeting; it could be life changing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the types of quanta of Copenhagen could be a representation of the letters/symbols/characters/glyphs that form the universe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;atoms then could be the words of nature&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no individual letters in Hebrew, like &#39;a&#39; or &#39;I&#39; as in English. This is because it is regarded as a &lt;strong&gt;broken vessel&lt;/strong&gt; if it is alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every object, everything that exists in the Universe is a manifestation of &lt;strong&gt;Divine Desire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is one man going to come down from heaven and &amp;quot;save&amp;quot; us? And from whom do we need saving? From ourselves? How can anyone save you from yourself? If G-d has granted us free choice, then only you can change yourself. G-d and the angels can only help you. [Shabbat angels - Two angels on shabbat. May it be even better next Shabbas] But you, I, have to take the first step. Have to say: &amp;quot;This is who I am. And this is what I am going to do...&amp;quot; and the rest will follow - if it is in accordance with God&#39;s wish...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/#water&quot;&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/#shabbat&quot;&gt;Shabbat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/#energy-is-energy---good-or-bad&quot;&gt;Energy is energy - good or bad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chashmalelectricity&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chashmal&lt;/em&gt;/Electricity &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/#chashmalelectricity&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity is the portal to the next stage of humanities evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we look at &lt;em&gt;chashmal&lt;/em&gt; as the full electro-magnetic spectrum and beyond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;water&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Water &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/#water&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water as communication medium. So is Chashmal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All was fine, until we encountered electricity (&lt;em&gt;chashmal&lt;/em&gt;). This was something we could only experience. We could not perceive it with any of our 5 senses. It was tremendously useful, and people were dying in their desire and need for its benefits and use. We did not hesitate at the door to this discovery, but rushed madly in - as if it was a new discovery of gold or diamonds - and began using this limitless font of energy we had discovered to benefit &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; [which as per usual, meant first those who could afford, or were lucky enough to be born into, access to it].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one thought to stop and the doorway and ask &amp;quot;What is it?&amp;quot;. Because we were still in the trance of the certainty of empirical measurements - as many still are. It is an essentially 2d comprehension of the world around us, rather like the behemoth. And so we rushed in, where angels might fear to tread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So onward intrepid explorers, armed with your electrically powered machines, and let us see what we can do... Well, we live in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/intention.html&quot;&gt;outcome&lt;/a&gt;. I am old, but, if you are young, you have to live with outcome of your ancestors creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shabbat&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Shabbat &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/#shabbat&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the decision to associate &lt;em&gt;chashmal&lt;/em&gt; with fire, and impose all the same criterion to its usage as was associated with fire in the religion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if that was the true prophetic insight, perhaps it is not an &amp;quot;equals&amp;quot;, but an &amp;quot;equivalent&amp;quot; and there are some places where it fits exactly, and some that it doesn&#39;t - even some that we haven&#39;t even thought of, or perceived yet. We were not aware of a lot of the following implications of this new force that followed the writ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in this time of lockdown, this decision is being tested. Just as the decisions that were made regarding &lt;em&gt;kashrut&lt;/em&gt; were made in a time where certain context that have emerged were not yet present. At each step of evolution of the Jewish cultures and traditions, we have stepped forward into them, and, even though there might have been dissension in the ranks, eventually stepped forward into the new revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, one man, Isaac Luria, the Ari, changed the course of Jewish evolution. Another Isaac..., not even an ordained rabbi, significantly influenced the way we conducted our affairs. Rambam, Maimonides, influenced many generations of Jews with his &lt;em&gt;Mishna Torah&lt;/em&gt;. We had certain traditions that were clearly laid out during the temple era, which are no longer practised, and have, for the most part, been replaced by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major areas that need to take into account what is happening in the world around us, and not to bury our heads in the sand, saying &amp;quot;God will save us&amp;quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/adam_eve.html&quot;&gt;Story of Adam and Eve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is &lt;em&gt;kashrut&lt;/em&gt;. The second is electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us begin with the latter. If we can no longer gather and take our services together, the best we have at this stage is to do it virtually. What if we recorded a shabbat service, and the screen automagically went on (ala &lt;em&gt;shaon shabbat&lt;/em&gt;) and we could watch and participate in the service in one&#39;s own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were allowed, we could even carry on the service together (ala &lt;em&gt;One Giant Leap&lt;/em&gt;). This is the kind of collaboration we need. We cannot be held by these constraints that were interpreted by a bygone age. Just as the original tablets could be read by anyone in their mother tongue, so He would want us to see it through eyes that are true to the Beholder, and not trying to see what others see. If the intention is not to use it for spiritual upliftment, then it is not sanctioned. Remember, the truth is known to the One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;energy-is-energy-good-or-bad&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Energy is energy - good or bad &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/chashmal/#energy-is-energy-good-or-bad&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy is energy, whether good or bad, positive or negative, replenishing or diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chashmal&lt;/em&gt;, electricity, as fire, is both and bad. To the universe, there is no difference – though to God there might be. Thus both are equal in the universal scheme of things – though the outcomes might be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is a rallying call, a guiding beacon calling us, challenging us to “manifest” the upper in the lower, and thus transform the lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;linear&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Linear &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/#linear&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every continuous line has a beginning and an end - assuming no loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/line.png&quot; alt=&quot;Line diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to designate a straight line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by two points, its beginning point &amp;amp; end point, on the plane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by a vector, which has a beginning point - known as the point of origin, and a distance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is another way, which is known as polar co-ordinates, which uses the circle &amp;amp; pi. It describes the line by its angle from the point of origin (with a baseline) and its distance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter two introduces the concept of movement in a certain direction thus that of goal &amp;amp; purpose. Male envisages movement as essentially linear. Thus, with power, he continues in a straight line to his goal, ignoring any collatoral damage, and not knowing when he has crossed the line, except after the crossing. The discipline, and constraint, is to know when to stop, when you have reached the &amp;quot;end&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that is not the topic of the moment, just note that this now has three aspects, or parts, that can be designated: beginning, middle and end. This partition can be found elsewhere too, as past, present &amp;amp; future, and inside, skin &amp;amp; outside, etc. One could use this mapping to describe a three-dimensional space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often reduced further (by the effects of egotism, or narcissism) to a two-dimensional space of the border &amp;amp; what is inside - ignoring the actual reality of what is outside the &amp;quot;borders&amp;quot;, however defined. For we &amp;quot;(awaken to consciousness)[../consciousness.md]&amp;quot; inside, and begin to garner information through our skin of our vessels regarding the &amp;quot;outside&amp;quot;. If that outside is exciting, and inviting, and safe, we are more likely to respond to it, and be open to it. If it is not, we are more likely to create a harder shell of protection from a more hostile environment. This produces binary, us &amp;amp; them, polarised thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the outside is all that is unknown, and really contains the great adventure of life. For, is it not the Hero&#39;s Journey to venture out into the unkown, and, once having overcome all the challenges of his or her encounter(s) with the unknown, returns home a hero?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third polar fashion is an even more accurate representation of the dynamic of perception. Let us use sight as the example. Our eyes are drawn to look at something. Light travels in a straight line, so what you see is in line with the angle/perspective that you are looking at it from - thus we have angle and direction (and power). This angle is determined by the choice of the &amp;quot;observer&amp;quot; or if, participant, through his entanglement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;line&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Line &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/#line&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we envisage a line, we envisage what is &amp;quot;linear momentum&amp;quot;, which is a point that moves along a certain trajectory (in this case, a straight line). However, that is incorrect. The line is actually a set of points, even though it looks like we &amp;quot;draw&amp;quot; the line. The collection we call, in this case, a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ways to produce a line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As described above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By moving the background (an old movie trick). Remember, the background give the context of whatever &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; is occurring in the foreground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-is-the-background&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Time is the background &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/#time-is-the-background&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is the moving background in/upon which everything occurs, and in which our lives unfold. We spend much time trying to remain still, for things to remain as they are - even for a moment. So we practice meditation, to still our minds, so that we can be more prepared for this constant moving background of time in which we exist. Of course, the other option is to try and &amp;quot;move faster than time&amp;quot;. In other words, if I could fore-tell, prophecy, know the future, I would have out-smarted time. Or if I can avoid my time of &amp;quot;death&amp;quot; - perhaps the prime motivator for prophecy, if not a calling. But know this, time marches on inexoribly - and to stop time - would be to stop life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time actually &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;/becomes the story of your life. Your narrative unfolds in time... Thus we encounter the mystery of the entanglement of time and space - I would call them conjugates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you like it to end? Ideally, not in death, but having achieved your goals, &amp;quot;completed&amp;quot;, so as to say, your life. That you will die (inevitably), but that you would die fulfilled. The drive to reach the place of fulfillment, of peace, of love, or success, is extremely strong, and entwined with the survival instinct, you become so intimate with you own story, that you &amp;quot;become&amp;quot; the story - and lose yourself in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this background upon which your particular life-story unfolds is a background that has a dynamic and momentum that is its own - and you are just like a leaf floating on the river, or a feather floating in the air, buffetted by the currents around you. You are born into the background, you will live in it, and die in &amp;amp; from it. It is, and you are but just a moment in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus you can&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego: Fight this bg&lt;br /&gt;
This is the alpha personality. The big person, who will make his stamp on history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submission: Accept this bg&lt;br /&gt;
This is the one who is disempowered, and submits to his fate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flow: Merge with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;flow&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Flow &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/#flow&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ideal. It is to live as a servant to G-d, and try to obey His Will. That sounds so Biblical, doesn&#39;t it. So let&#39;s translate that into the much more complex modern vernacular. There are certain laws and principles of Nature and the Universe that if we don&#39;t obey, we will find ourselves in trouble. Try to ignore the law of Gravity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we don&#39;t take into account, that those areas that we are unable to measure, or unable to perceive, or are not even aware of, still continue to affect the system and our lives. This is the question that the Zen koan asks: &amp;quot;What sound does the tree make in the forest when it falls, if there is no-one to hear it?&amp;quot; Put more simply, even though it is unknown, it still can have a huge effect on the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it from a child perspective. As an adult, you know things that the child does not. You are aware of influences and effects and outcomes that the child is not. Hopefully he will in time, but that is not guarenteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with us, and our Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the scenario we are struggling with at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, let&#39;s keep our focus on the individual. It is easier to comprehend - and even perhaps more useful. Encountering this background through a patchwork collection of interactions, we create our taperstry - which I call my story. This is who I am. This is what I do. This is my name. This is my profession. I am a doctor, worker, employee, president... We differentiate and separate ourselves by our narratives. Do you agree with my version (thesis), or not (antithesis) - now you are a potential threat to who/what I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I seek conflict, or reject your version, we remain stuck in this perpetual cycle of thesis vs. antithesis. But, synthesis is a choice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar is my relationship with this background. I can submit, which is the general notion, and the easiest. Or I can try and fight it. If I lose, I pay the price for rejecting it. If I win, I am successful - but estranged from it. So I will need to surround myself with a bastion of others who will benefit similarly from my/our success. This requires us to create and maintain our version of the what is really happening in this background. So we build a &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;, a society, in which we can hold this narrative, which has succeeded for me and my supporters. The end result is that you believe so completely in this narrative that you relate to it as if the narrative (and not the actual event) is real - and made of real things that cannot be changed. [Ala &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom Mantra&lt;/strong&gt; - G-d grant me the Wisdom...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is why it has been called an &amp;quot;ego trip&amp;quot;. Because your ego has identified (and been nourished) by this story, that you begin to fully live it - and thus now perpetuate it - so that it does become &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;. Real laws, real prison, real weapons, real killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of this venture will always depend on how true its description of the background is.&lt;br /&gt;
So, to the most balanced and productive relationship with this background within which we exist, would be to synthesise with it. To &amp;quot;dance&amp;quot; together with it. Like a surfer riding a wave to the shore. This is called &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/flow.md&quot;&gt;Being in the Flow&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. It is attuning yourself to the current of time you are in. As we say: &amp;quot;It is not the right time&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;It is time for you to...&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;formlessness&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Formlessness &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/#formlessness&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we have? We have the background. We have the point - which we called the &amp;quot;beginning&amp;quot; - and it exists somewhere inside this background. This is the only point of reference we have, which we also refer to as &amp;quot;the point of origin&amp;quot;. This is a &amp;quot;static&amp;quot; point, in relation to whatever line is formed. If the line is continuous and coherent (can be tracked) - then we can always find the beginning... But, that point is not real anymore. It happened, and it could take billions of years for you to realise that. And the only place you can realise it from is your present point of awareness - which the moment you are aware of, it changes! Thus the only solution to this conundrum is to enter a state of formlessness and merge, become One, with the background, like a fish in the water. So that you can flow with the currents of time, holding your self, not your position or your place in the story. Remember, like reading a book. You remember your place so that you can return to that story and continue where you left off. But once you continue, you no longer need the bookmark. And to remember every bookmark along the way, would be foolish - and never let you get on with the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;memories&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Memories &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/#memories&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are memories real? Is History a true rendering of events and how they unfolded? Or are they always and only the stories by the victors and the survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-way-inf-less-greater1&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Which way [ inf &amp;lt;-&amp;gt;1 ]? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/#which-way-inf-less-greater1&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because any narrative that attemps to describe the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; world(s) we live in can only approach this from one of two perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside [ infinite -&amp;gt; 1 ]: From the perspective of the infinite to the finite (inf -&amp;gt; 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside [ 1 -&amp;gt; infinite]: From the separate point of individual consciousness expanding into the unknown realms of the possibly infinite.&lt;br /&gt;
A gap that the finite can never bridge, because the finite cannot contain the infinite - whereas the infinite can contain and infinite, &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/math-numbers/line/infinity.html&quot;&gt;unimaginable amount of finites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the absolute totality of the infinite of infinities, &lt;em&gt;Ein Sof Aur&lt;/em&gt;. Perfection reigns, endless peace and harmony, no disturbance, no ripple.... complete nothingness - and infinite ocean of bliss. Upon this background it is impossible to depict anything, to say anything. For how could one use finite minds to describe an infinite event? However, something changed, something shifted, something happened to disturb this endless emptiness, and we say that &amp;quot;a point emerged&amp;quot; ex-nihilo - out of nothing. We call this &amp;quot;the beginning&amp;quot;. This is know as the centre - or middle point.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-sustainable&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;What is sustainable? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/sustainable/#what-is-sustainable&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can an individual be truly sovereign? In order to be sovereign, one has to have no dependencies on anything or anyone else. In other words, one would have to be completely self-sustaining&amp;quot;. That is perhaps an interesting definition of G-d! It is patently obvious that nothing in existence is truly sovereign. The only possibility is that that which is or contains everything, would, in fact, by definition be self-sovereign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need the proper air to breathe. That air has to be &amp;quot;produced&amp;quot;. We need water to live. That water has to &amp;quot;sustained&amp;quot; else we die. We need food for nourishment. When hungry, we will eat anything. A hungry man is an angry man. Worse, is to eat toxic food - for then the person becomes toxic, and that can manifest in many If food is not made from food that is grown from the earth, would it not essentially be classified as a drug? And as such should be monitored? If a chemical agent is added to something that is imbibed, is it not essentially a drug? The active elements in the growing plants, from quinine to psilyciban, are not the same drugs - though the active element they contain might be chemically the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/alchemy.md&quot;&gt;extracting the &amp;quot;spirit&amp;quot; of the plant&lt;/a&gt;] and should not be labelled as drugs. Drugs are manufactured elelements that affect our environment chemically. All the active elements found in plants need to be taken in the context/spirit in which they have grown. All drugs are best taken in isolation. (In fact there is little information on the effects of multiple drugs) ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other living thing is dependent on its environment for its continued existence. Just as every single human being is dependent on countless unnamed, unknown, invisible people who have enabled the environment in which we live. We awaken in this garden. Yes, it has its dangers - after all, the bane of all life is death. And death is the bonded sister of life. For the truth is, there can be no life without death. And those who believe they can cheat death, die - within or without - and often become dealers in death themselves. Let us say, in the beginning it might be just a pastime, but as death approaches, it will eventually become an obsession. It is perhaps the existential question that is being asked in these time: Are we more powerful than G-d? Can we &amp;quot;cheat&amp;quot; (I am sure they prefer the word &amp;quot;overcome) death and achieve eternal life - thus becoming like G-ds! Truly having the power of life and death over mere mortals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming death means that your focus is death - that is why you become a death dealer. It proportes to run under the banner of life. But it will ask the questions of &amp;quot;Why do we die? Is there something we can tweak to slow or stop this process?&amp;quot; This is the classic mechanistic approach. As if we are essentially machines, and thus if you improve the material... We have even upped it a notch. Perhaps if we tweak the defense system, we will improve the overall longitivity of the entity under investigation. Unfortunately, that entity is us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming life means that your focus is life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it truly death that we wish to overcome? Is it not life that you would rather live? (light_dark.html) Is not the ideal to live a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; life - in all senses of the word? So would it not make sense to build communities around living a wholesome life? Andinstead of beginning at the top - as long as you believe in .... G-d, or money, or family, or... and start in the real empirical world. In the world of Assiyah, of Doing, this Kingdom of G-d, the world we live in (and the only one we know). If a person (young or old, man or woman) eats &amp;quot;well&amp;quot; - and by well I mean healthily (local, organic, seasonal food) - he has more chance of growing up hale and hearty - unless G-d has other plans. Because we know (besides the science, it is also simple common sense) that if you eat toxic food, it will make you toxic and sick. Thus how can we live in a society that justifies the manufacture of toxic food - or at least has toxins in it! How can we continue to live a life in which we are turning our water - the very life blood of our existence - toxic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vaunted cities are rat infested cesspools with patches of shiny veneers. Is it because we cannot look at ourselves in the mirror of what we have created for ourselves and recognise ourselves in the reflection of what we see around us. Can we not see the trees because of the thickness of the forest? We as a collective sit at this point of radical re-evaluation - just as all adults have passed through - where we need to take responsibility for our own lives. No mama, no pappa to bail you out. You are know the &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot;. This is &amp;quot;our&amp;quot; creation - this that we are in. Do we continue to barrel on doing the same things and expecting a different result? Or do we decide to begin to do things differently? And what is that difference? Let us gather under the Banner of Life. Let us work together to build a way for us to sustain and support our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hexagram-and-hebraic-sacred-science&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE HEXAGRAM AND HEBRAIC SACRED SCIENCE &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/maria/#the-hexagram-and-hebraic-sacred-science&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variously called the Shield of David (Magen David), the Star of David, and Solomon&#39;s Seal, the hexagram has come to be the symbol most identified with the Jewish people. Composed of two equilateral triangles whose apexes are defined by the six radial arc points of a circle, this six-pointed star is an important esoteric symbol, associated with the heart Chakra in Tantric yoga and discovered in the ground plan of Stonehenge.[^16] It has long been though that it was Arabic alchemy that in the West most popularised this symbol of equilibrium between the opposed archetypical forces of fire (the expansive force represented by the upward pointing triangle) and water (the contractive force represented by the downward-pointing triangle). Since it was in the early Middle Ages that the hexagram began to be featured prominently in Jewish magical texts and amulets, most modern historians have concluded that it was probably through this Arabic source that the hexagram was most directly transmitted to the medieval Spanish Kabbalists. But since in the Arabic literature employing this symbol the hexagram is normally given a Hebrew derivation through the terms &amp;quot;Solomon&#39;s Seal&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Shield of David&amp;quot; by which it is called,[^17] it may well be that there was a continuous association of the Jewish esoteric tradition with this esoteric symbol of David and Solomon that preceded Islam. The Talmudic reference to the hexagram engraved on the seal ring of Solomon[^18] supports the possibility of an early association of the hexagram with Jewish esoteric understanding and practice reaching as far back as the biblical period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gershom Scholem supports the contrary view that “the hexagram is not a Jewish symbol.”[^19] He does admit that this figure and its names “Seal of Solomon and Shield of David . . . go back to pre-Islamic Jewish magic”[^20], but considers that the hexagram “had one and only one purpose in its career as magic: to serve as protection against demons.”[^21]. But Raphael Patai, in his important book The Jewish Alchemists, has traced a very different history for the alchemical tradition that must cause a major revision of the received opinion concerning the relationship of Jews to alchemy and its hexagram symbol. As he reveals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first nonfictitious alchemists of the western world live, as far as can be ascertained, in Hebraic Egypt. And the earliest amongst them was Maria Hebraea, Maria the Hebrew, or Maria the Jewess, for whom our chief source is Zosimus the Panopolitan. Zosimus is the first Greek alchemical author whose actual writings have survived. He lived in Hellenistic Egypt, about 300 C.E. . . . We can thus tentatively assign her to the third century C.E. at the latest.[^23]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quotations from Maria’s teachings, cosmological principles appear that have been thought to emerge only later in the Kabbalah:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”One becomes two, two becomes three, and by means of the third and fourth achieves unity; thus two are but one” . . . “Join the male and the female, and you will find what is sought.” . . . “If you do not render the corporeal substances incorporeal, and the incorporeal substances corporeal, and if you do not make the two bodies one, nothing of the expected will be produced.” . . . She (Maria) said: “The philosopher (Pseudo-) Democritus said . . . ‘Transform nature, and make the spirit which is hidden inside the body come out . . . Destroy the body, and make it become water, and extract that which is in it.’” . . . “The ‘water’ which I have mentioned is an angel, and descends from the sky, and the earth accepts it on account of its (the earth’s) moistness. The water of the sky is held by the water of the earth.”[^24]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria Hebraea reveals alchemy to be a sacred science much like the more theoretical sacred sciences of geometry, harmonics and number, the precise procedures of metallurgy, the first human technology, being studied and valued not only for their mundane usefulness but for what they can reveal of the principles governing both natural law and cosmic possibility. Her first quoted rule, which we are told “the Hebrew priestess shrieked,”[^25] seems to foreshadow the kabbalistic doctrine of the &lt;em&gt;Partzufim&lt;/em&gt;, the divine personalitities. Appearing in the &lt;em&gt;Bahir&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Zohar&lt;/em&gt; and Lurianic Kabbalah, are the five main such &lt;em&gt;Partzufim&lt;/em&gt; related to the ten circles, called &lt;em&gt;Sefirot&lt;/em&gt;, of the Tree of Life Diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tree is a diagram composed of ten circular &lt;em&gt;Sefirot&lt;/em&gt; and the twenty-two paths connecting them. The names of the ten &lt;em&gt;Sefirot&lt;/em&gt; both define the attributes of a single divine figure and the five Partzufim into which they are transformed in the course of cosmic history. These names are &lt;em&gt;Keter&lt;/em&gt; (Crown), &lt;em&gt;Chokhmah&lt;/em&gt; (Wisdom), &lt;em&gt;Binah&lt;/em&gt; (Understanding), &lt;em&gt;Chesed&lt;/em&gt; (Mercy), &lt;em&gt;Gevurah&lt;/em&gt; (Judgement), &lt;em&gt;Tiferet&lt;/em&gt; (Beauty), &lt;em&gt;Netzach&lt;/em&gt; (Eternity), &lt;em&gt;Hod&lt;/em&gt; (Splendour), &lt;em&gt;Yesod&lt;/em&gt; (Foundation), &lt;em&gt;Malkhut&lt;/em&gt; (Kingdom). As &lt;em&gt;Partzufim&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Keter&lt;/em&gt; is identified with &lt;em&gt;Arikh Anpin&lt;/em&gt; (Long Face), the original &lt;em&gt;Partzuf&lt;/em&gt; who is the source of the next two &lt;em&gt;Partzufim&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Abba&lt;/em&gt; (Father), identified with &lt;em&gt;Chokhmah&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Imma&lt;/em&gt; (Mother), identified with &lt;em&gt;Binah&lt;/em&gt;, whose continuous mating is responsible both for the continuous process of creation and the generation of the originally androgynous &lt;em&gt;Ze’ir Anpin&lt;/em&gt; (Short Face), the son figure identified with the six &lt;em&gt;sefirot&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Chesed&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Yesod&lt;/em&gt;, from whom the daughter-bride &lt;em&gt;Partzuf&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Nukvah&lt;/em&gt; (Female), identified with &lt;em&gt;Malkhut&lt;/em&gt;, separates in order to mate intermittently with &lt;em&gt;Ze’ir Anpin&lt;/em&gt; and so both direct the course of Providence and generate the higher souls of the righteous. The six-&lt;em&gt;Sefirot&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Partzuf&lt;/em&gt; of the son is clearly the most important, and may also be said to combine a divine upper triad (&lt;em&gt;Chesed&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Gevurah&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Tiferet&lt;/em&gt;) with a human lower triad (&lt;em&gt;Netzach&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Hod&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Yesod&lt;/em&gt;), a unification of the infinite and finite that fulfils and models the purpose of Creation. This purpose is the generation both of the supernal son and so achieve the unification of these two levels of divine sonship, a cosmic purpose previously presented as the priestly secret doctrine of the son.[^26]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know apply the kabbalistic concept of the &lt;em&gt;Partzufim&lt;/em&gt; to Maria Hebraea’s statement: “One [&lt;em&gt;Arikh Anpin&lt;/em&gt; (Long Face)] become two [&lt;em&gt;Abba&lt;/em&gt; (father) and &lt;em&gt;Imma&lt;/em&gt; (mother)], two [&lt;em&gt;Abba&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Imma&lt;/em&gt;] becomes three [&lt;em&gt;Ze’ir Anpin&lt;/em&gt; (the short face and son)], and by means of the third [&lt;em&gt;Ze’ir Anpin&lt;/em&gt;] and fourth [&lt;em&gt;Nukvah&lt;/em&gt; (female of &lt;em&gt;Ze’ir Anpin&lt;/em&gt; and daughter-bride)] achieves unity [a metaphorically sexual unification]; thus two are but one.” The meaning of this “unification” of the transcendent or “incorporeal” with the immanent or “corporeal” is well understood by what the tenth-century Arab alchemist Ibn Umail understood Maria to mean by the descending water or angel through which nature can be transformed to realise the spirit within it: “As for her statement ‘[The water] descends from the sky’, she meant by this the child which they say will be born for them in the air, while conception had taken place in the lower (region); this being (through) the higher celestial strength which the water has gained by its absorption of the air.”[^27] The sexual model, imputed not only to humans but to metals, is important because it sees the Great Work of alchemy to be such a unification of the opposing metallurgic procedures for dissolving the fixed and coagulating the volatile as can generate a more precious new being, “the child which they say will be born for them in the air,” one whose perfection consists precisely in the conjunction of both these purified qualities—truly a new definition of what I have shown to be the Hebraic secret doctrine of the son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria Hebaea’s alchemy also seems already to suggest use of the hexagram model, the descending “water of the sky” not only denoting the descending triangle of the hexagram but also the concept of the upper and lower waters in the Genesis creation account, which we shall later see can also be modelled by the hexagram and in a way whose clarification of otherwise inexplicable features of the biblical account reinforces the early association of the hexagram with the sacred science of the Hebraic priesthood. The alchemical revelation of Maria Hebraea would seem, then, to be a direct outgrowth of the an earlier and continuing Hebraic sacred science and to provide a link to the later theoretical elaborations of the tradition in the more sexually generative form of kabbalistic myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patai provides much evidence to show that “Jewish alchemists were the teachers of both Muslim and Christian alchemists in the Middle Ages, just as they had been of Hellenistic alchemists in antiquity.”[^28] One Arab work, falsely attributed to Khalid Ibn Yazad, is particularly indebted to Maria Hebraea, as can be seen by the following quotation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this dissolution and congelation, which I mentioned, is the dissolution of the body and the congelation of the spirit, and they are two but have one single operation, because the spirit cannot be congealed except with the dissolution of the body, and similarly the body cannot be dissolved except with the congelation of the spirit. And the body and soul, when they are joined at the same time, each acts on its partner, making it similar to itself. . . . For the composition of artifice or magisterium is the conjunction or matrimony of the congealed spirit with the dissolved body. . . .[^29]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again this essential alchemical marriage of opposites seems suggestive of the hexagram model, the “dissolved body”, signified by its ascending triangle, “joined at the same time” to the “congealed spirit”, signified by its descending triangle, a conjunction that represents the culmination of the Great Work of alchemy, the production of the “Philosopher’s Stone”. As Patai indicates, in considering the alchemical legends surrounding Solomon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The close association between Solomon and the philosopher’s stone is show by the fact that the materia prima of the stone was sometimes represented as the two interlaced triangles of “Solomon’s seal”. . . . the sign of the “fiery water”, since it consists of a combination of two symbols: that of fire, which rises upward and hence is symbolised by the upward pointing triangle, and that of water, which descends from the sky and is represented by the downward pointing triangle. The old midrashic interpretation of the Hebrew word for heaven, shamayim, namely that it is a combination of the words esh, fire, and mayim, water, was known by the alchemists.[^30]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognition of the coherence between the doctrines of alchemy and the Kabbalah appears in a Jewish sixteenth-century treatise entitled &lt;em&gt;Esh M’Saref&lt;/em&gt; (The Refiner’s Fire):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But know that the mysteries of this wisdom (i.e., alchemy) do not differ from the supernal mysteries of the Kabbalah. For just as there is a reflection of predicaments in sanctity, so there is also impurity. And the sefirot which are in &lt;em&gt;Assilut&lt;/em&gt; (the first kabbalistic world) . . . are also in &lt;em&gt;‘Asiya&lt;/em&gt; (the fourth kabbalistic world of matter) . . . yea, even int hat kingdom which is commonly called Minerals, although on the supernal plane their excellence is always greater . . . Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, is of the type of the vulgar students of nature who set about contemplating the valleys and profundities of nature, but do not descend into its secrets, wherefore they labour in vain and remain servants forever. They give counsel about procuring the son of the wise, whose generation is impossible for nature. (2 Kings 4:14). But they can contribute nothing to his generation. . . .[^31]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great secret shared by both the Kabbalah and alchemy is that which I have termed the secret doctrine of the son, that “son of the wise, whose generation is impossible for nature,” and who unites the essential qualities of the higher and lower planes, of the infinite and the finite....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Maria Hebraea of the second or third century C.E. Alexandria, we may see a union of Hebrew esoteric teachings with some seed elements of an Egyption Hermentic practice of metallurgy that bore the new ideological fruit of alchemical formulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time in Palestime there was a parallel theoretical development that showed a similar concern with the opposing qualities of fire and water and so with the possible employment of the hexagram to symbolise their union. This is the most important text of Hebraic sacred science, the &lt;em&gt;Sefer Yetzirah&lt;/em&gt;, in which the fire is correlated with the mother letter &lt;em&gt;Shin&lt;/em&gt; and the head, water with the mother letter &lt;em&gt;Mem&lt;/em&gt; and the abdomen, and the air, which mediates between these opposed elements and their upper and lower location, is correlated with the letter &lt;em&gt;Aleph&lt;/em&gt; and the chest. As in alchemy, though differently, this text defines the process of generation the cosmic man. Given that in the latter alchemical tradition, the circumstances of upper fire and lower water betoken the model of the hexagram, referent to the hexagram in the Sefer Yetzirah, concerned as they both are with the same sacred scientific quest to study those features of theoretical or technological science whose precise process appear to reveal the structure and purpose of existence. One difference between these teachings, however, is that Maria Hebraea synthesises Hebraic sacred science with some early developments of metallurgy in Egypt while in the &lt;em&gt;Sefer Yetzirah&lt;/em&gt; Hebraic sacred science is synthesised with the Pythagorian sacred science of Greece. But the most important point to be made is that somewhere between the second and third centuries C.E. there was a separate flowering of Hebraic sacred science both in post-Temple Palestine and diaspora Alexandria whose similarities would seem to imply the same source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source is most likely to be the members of the priesthood deprofessionalised after the destruction of the Temple, who would have become private teachers of what must have been a long tradition of Temple sacred science. And one feature of this ancient science that appears to have surfaced alike in the teachings of Maria Hebraea and the &lt;em&gt;Sefer Yetzirah&lt;/em&gt; is a peculiar join definition of fire above and water below, which in the later alchemical tradition was identified with the figure of the hexagram and given a Hebrew origin in the names by which it was known, Solomon’s seal and the Shield of David. As with the discovery of Troy just where Homer had claimed it to be, so it seems reasonable to conclude from the long association of the hexagram with Hebrew kings that his geometric figure was, indeed, a particular aspect of the Jewish esoteric tradition going back at least to the Temple priesthood. . . . It is appropriate at this point to review the method by which the hexagram is geometrically constructed. As will be seen, it is a method that recreates the primal acts of creation as they are defined from these very geometric processes in the esoteric traditions that have a geometric base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a partial compendium of alchemical works. I liked the sacred manner in which they approached and dealt with this exploration of natural and chemical reactions. It seems to me that we have lost wisdom in our much more &amp;quot;secular&amp;quot; approach. To have dragged the wonders of the world in which we exist down to the mud and grime of our earthly existence, acknowledging nothing higher or greater than human endeavour, human imagination, human creativity and the great human power over nature - is an abomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sacred-texts.com/alc/index.htm&quot;&gt;full list&lt;/a&gt;. But there is plenty to chew on in this selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aros the Philosopher had a meeting with &lt;em&gt;Mary the Prophetess the Sister of Moyses&lt;/em&gt;, and approaching to her, he paid her respect and said unto her, &amp;quot;O Prophetess, I have truly heard many say of you that you whiten the Stone in one day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said, &amp;quot;Yea, Aros, even in a part of one day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aros said: O Lady Mary, when will the Work be which you affirm? How shall we whiten and afterwards add blackness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary said; O Aros, oftentimes Nations have dyd about this part. Know you not, O Aros; that there is a water or a thing which whitens Hendragem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Aros answering said to her. O Lady it is so as you say, but in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary answered, Hermes in all his Books has said that the Philosophers whiten the Stone in one hour of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aros said to her, Oh how excellent is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary said, it is most excellent to him that is ignorant of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aros said, if men have all the four Elements, he [Hermes] said that their fumes might be completed, and complexioned, and coagulated, and retained in one day, untill they fullfill the consequence (i.e. attain the end).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary said, O Aros, by God, if thy senses or understanding were not solid, you should not hear these words from me, until the Lord should fill my Heart with the grace of his divine Will. Nevertheless take the Allum of Spain, the white gum and the red gum, which is the Kibric of the Philosophers, and their Sol and the greater Tincture, and marry Gumm with Gumm togeather with a true Matrimony. Make them like a running Water, and vitrify this water which has been laboured or wrought upon for one day, out of the two Lubechs, upon the fixed body, and liquefy them by the secret of Nature in the Vessel of Philosophy. Did you understand us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes Lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary said, Keep the fume and take care that none of it fly away. And let your measure be with a gentle fire such as is the Measure of the heat of the Sun in the Month of June or July, and stay by your Vessel and behold it with care how it grows black, grows red, and grows white in less than three hours of the day, and the fume will penetrate the body, and the Spirit will be bound up, and they will be like milk, incerating, and liquefying and penetrating: and that is the secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aros said I do not say that this will be allways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary said unto him: Aros, and this is more wonderful concerning this, that it was not among the Ancients, nor did it come to him by curing, or by the Medicinal Art and that is take the white, clear and honoured Herb growing on the Hillocks, and pound it fresh as it is in its Hour, and that is the true Body not flying from the Fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Aros said it is the Stone of Truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said yes. But yet men know not this regimen (rule or way of working) with the speediness thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aros said, and what afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary said, vitrify upon it Kibric or Zibeic and there are the two fumes comprehending the two Lights, and project upon that the complement of the Tinctures of the Spirits, and the weights of Truth, and pound it all, and put it to the Fire, and you shall see wonderfull things from them. The whole goverment consists in the temper of the Fire, O how strange it is, how it will be moved from one colour to another, in less than an hour of the Day, until it arrives at the mark of redness and whiteness, and cast away the Fire and permit it to cool, and open it and you will find the clear pearly Body to be of the Colour of the Poppy of the Wood mixed with whiteness and that is it which is incerating, liquefying and penetrating, and one golden piece thereof, the weight of a small golden Coin, falleth upon a thousand thousand and two hundred thousand. That is the hidden secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Aros fell down upon his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said to him, Lift up your head Aros: because I will shorten for you the thing, as that clear body which is thrown upon the Hillocks, and is not obtained by putrefaction or motion. Take and pound it with Gumm Elsaron, and with the two fumes because the Body comprehending or retaining them is Gumm Elsaron and grind it all. Therefore approach because it all melts. If you project its wife upon it, it will be as a distilling Water, and when the Aire shall strike it, it will be congealed and be one body, and make projection of it, and you will behold Wonders: O Aros that is the hidden secret of Scholia; and know that the said two fumes are the Root of this Art, and they are the white Kibric and the humid calx, but the fixed Body is of the Heart of Saturn comprehending the Tincture, and the Fields of Wisdom or of Scholia. And the Philosophers have named it by many and all names, and received or gathered from the Hillocks it is a clear white Body, and these are the medicine of this Art, part is procured and part is found upon the Hillocks; and know Aros that the wise men have not called it the Fields of Wisdom, or of Scholia, unless because Scholia will not be compleated but by it; and in the Scholia there are nothing but wonderfull things. For there also enters into them the four Stones, and its true regimen is as I have said. And that is first Scoyare, Ade, and Zethet; by that make your Allegory as Hermes has done in his Books Scoyas, and the Philosophers have allways made the regimen longer, and have resembled the work to every thing which ought not to make the work, and they make the Magistery to be in one year, and this but onely for hiding it from the ignorant people, untill it be confirmed in their Hearts and their senses (till they believe the Art),: because the Art will not be completed except only in Gold; because it is the great secret of God: and they who hear of our secrets do not verify them (nor believe them to be true), by reason of their ignorance. Did you understand Aros?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aros said yes. But tell me about that vessel, without which the Work will not be accomplisht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary said that the Vessel of Hermes which the Stoicks have concealed, and it is not a Necromanticall Vessel, but it is the Measure of your Fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aros said: O Lady you have obeyed (been a scholar) in the Society of Scoyari: O Prophetess, have you found among the Secrets of the Philosophers, which they have set down in their Books, that any one can make the Art out of one Body?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mary said: Yes: which Hermes has not taught, because the Root of Scholia is a body which cannot be made smooth or plain and incurable (unconquerable) and it is a poyson mortifying all bodies, and it pulverises them and coagulates Mercury with its odour. And she said, I swear to you by the eternal God, that that poison when it is dissolved until it is made a subtle Water, I care not by what dissolution it is done, does coagulate Mercury into Luna with the strength of Truth, and it falls into the Throne of Jupiter, and forms him into Luna. The Science is in all Bodys, but the Stoics, by reason of the shortness of their lives, and the Length of the Work, have concealed this; and they found out these tinging Elements, and they increased them, and all the Philosophers teach them, except the Vessel of Hermes, because it is divine, and of the Wisdom of the Lord hidden from Nations: and they who are ignorant of it, know not the Regimen of Truth, because of their Ignorance of the Vessel of Hermes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mary briefly soundeth forth
Strange things like Thunder round the Earth.
She with two Gumms makes the Bottom stay
What else would fly away.
Three things if you three hours attend
Are chained together in the End.
Mary the Light of dew, and Art has got
In three hours to tye the Knot.
Pluto&#39;s daughter, it is she
Who bindeth Loves confederacy
Joyned with three seeds she does aspire
To be exalted in the Fire.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introitus. Our Lord, fount of goodness, inspirer of the sacred art, from whom all good things come to your faithful, have mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christe. Christ, Holy one, blessed stone of the art of the science who for the salvation of the world hast inspired the light of the science, for the extirpation of the unbelievers, have mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyrie. Our Lord, divine fire, help our hearts, that we may be able, to your praise, to expand the sacraments of the art, have mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduale. He descends like rain upon the fleece, and as showers falling gently upon the earth. Allelujah. O blessed creator of the earth, whiter than snow, sweeter than sweetness, fragrant at the bottom of the vessel like balsam. O salutary medicine for men, that cureth every weakness of the body: O sublime fount whence gushes forth truly the true water of life into the garden of thy faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ave Maria. Hail beautiful lamp of heaven, shining light of the world! Here art thou united with the moon, here is made the band of Mars and the conjunction of Mercury. From these three is born through through the magistery of the art, in the river bed, the strong giant whom a thousand times a thousand seek, when these three shall have dissolved, not into rain water... but into mercurial water, into this our blessed gum which dissolves of itself and is named the Sperm of the Philosophers. Now he makes haste to bind and betroth himself to the virgin bride, and to get her with child in the bath over a moderate fire. But the Virgin will not become pregnant at once unless she be kissed in repeated embraces. Then she conceives in her body, and thus is begotten the child of good omen, in accordance with the order of nature. Then will appear in the bottom of the vessel the mighty Ethiopian, burned, calcined, discoloured, altogether dead and lifeless. He asks to be buried, to be sprinkled with his own moisture and slowly calcined till he shall arise in glowing form from the fierce fire... Behold a wondrous restoration and renewal of the Ethiopian! Because of the bath of rebirth he takes a new name, which the philosophers call the natural sulphur and their son, this being the stone of the philosophers. And behold it is one thing, one root, one essence with nothing extraneous added and from which much that was superfluous is taken away by the magistery of the art... It is the treasure of treasures, the supreme philosophical potion, the divine secret of the ancients. Blessed is he that finds such thing. One that has seen this thing writes and speaks openly, and I know that his testimony is true. Praise be to God for evermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-the-philadelphian-gold&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;On the Philadelphian Gold &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#on-the-philadelphian-gold&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Conference betwixt Philochrysus and Philadelphus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: This was upon me to ask you. You may remember then that you told me how the description of your city which we then read, was more literal, than is easy to be believed, and withal more mystical than it is possible for the wisest of mortals to comprehend. And in particular you told me that it was built first of true and substantial Gold; secondly of fine Gold; thirdly of transparent or glassy Gold; and fourthly of living Gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I desire now that you would answer me to all these particulars in order. Do you then say that this city is built of true Gold, and that it is not only metaphorically said to be built of Gold? Is it as real and substantial, is it as visible and palpable, and has it as many good qualities as this which I have now in my hand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Yes, Philochrysus, I can assure you that it is built of true and not metaphorical Gold, as some would have it only to be. This Gold, I say, is no less real and substantial, and no less visible and palpable to its inhabitants and has as many, yea more, good qualities that that which you hold in your hand, and seem so pleased with. I know that this is a strange language, and I shall have much ado to make myself understood by you but in any degree. Because I must speak of that which you have never seen, or handled; though others have both seen and handled of it, and you also may come in time to do the same. So that it will be almost as hard a matter for one that is born blind to understand the philosophy of colours, or one born deaf the nature and distinction of sounds, as for you to comprehend what I am about to say of a certain substance that is visible to some but not to you, palpable to some but not to you; and which therefore you have no kind of apprehension of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I promise to be very attentive. Do me the favour but to satisfy me as far as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Well, I will endeavour your satisfaction, after that you shall have answered me a question or two that I have to propose to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I am very ready to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Why do ye believe that piece of Gold which ye showed me, to be true, real and substantial, and not shadowy, figurative and accidental?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: Why do I believe so? I am not such a stranger to the truth, as not to be able to distinguish it from a shadow. A shadow will fly from me if I go to catch at it, but this I can grasp fast enough. A shadow depends on the substance, and on the position of the Sun which casts it. It has no figure but from the substance, and that is always very faint and weak; it cannot be touched, it has no ponderosity, no light, no power in it. But this is ponderous, bright and powerful. You see me touch it, and its figure is not faint or weak but vivid and strong, without depending upon anything else. Wherever I move it, and whatever the position of it may be to the Sun or light, it still retains the same shape and the same substance. And now I have it fast, I dare venture its flying away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: I see you are well satisfied with yourself. But pray tell me, how would you give a description of it, to satisfy another that had never seen it, or perhaps never heard of it; or if ever heard of it, yet not otherwise than as a figurative sound to please children with, or as a rattle, a picture, a shadow, a name without substance, without reality? How would you make it to be understood to a Philosopher, and how to a merchant that is no philosopher, supposing them both to be strangers to the nature and use of this sovereign metal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: Truly, Philadelphus, you begin to puzzle me. And besides I cannot see whither all your windings and turnings will at last lead me. Indeed, it would be a difficult matter to resolve satisfactorily either a Philosopher or a merchant concerning this dear precious metal, if they have not some manner of notice of it beforehand. But since it is not unlawful to make such a supposition, I am ready also to make such an answer as I can.&lt;br /&gt;
I would therefore endeavour to satisfy them, by making use of such ideas, images and conceptions which they are already acquainted with; and by compounding them and dividing them, I would strive to frame in the inquirer an idea, image and conception hereof, which might approach as near as possible to the truth. As for instance, if I were to discourse with a philosopher, whom I will suppose to live in the remotest part of Tartary, or in some dark corner near to the Northern Pole where mines of Gold were never so much as heard of, and no name even found for it in the language of the country. I would think in the first place what to call it, that he might in some sort apprehend me, while I am discoursing with him. Now because some Copper mines may be near to him, and he may have both seen and handled and also tried several experiments upon this metal, therefore I will call it fine Copper or perhaps fine Brass, if this be likewise known to him. Then because I must speak to him in his own terms, and he has used himself to those of Mercury and Sulphur, I will tell him this fine Copper is compounded of a pure Mercurial Water and a pure Sulphureous earth, exactly proportioned and duly maturated and concocted by the Sun-beams in some proper matrix or vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I will, as far as I am able, show him the difference, both in quantity and quality, of the compounding principles of this fine Copper, and of his Copper. Whereupon I tell him that the Mercurial Water, which enters into the composition of this fine Copper, is not only more subtle, defecated and pure, than that which is in that Gothic Copper of his, but also that it is there in a much greater quantity. Likewise I tell him that the quantity of the Brimstone or Sulphureous Earth, which enters into the composition of the Gothic copper is greater than that which is in this fine (which I call for distinction the Peruvian) Copper, but that in the former it is more coarse than in the latter. Herein lies the main difference of the Peruvian and the Gothic Copper (which I must make my philosopher understand) as to the composition of the principles both in the one and the other. Which are both essentially the same, but diversified as well according to quality as quantity. He must then confess to me, that the Mercury in the Gothic Copper must needs be originally infected and poisoned, and that there must be a defect in its proportion: as likewise that the coarseness, the superfluity and the combustibleness of its Sulphur are no inconsiderable impediments to the perfection of this metal. And he will grant me to this, I believe, though he never have seen the fine metal of Peru, that there may be such a Copper there found as I do describe, if there may be but a Mercury, or water of Life, freed from its original infection and poison, and then fitly adapted and conjoined with a proper Sulphur that shall be pure and of an incombustible nature, so as not to diminish in the severest fires.&lt;br /&gt;
However perhaps he will maintain, that I ought not altogether to despise the Sulphureous Earth of his Gothick Copper; for that though it were not so pure, fixed and permanent as that of the other, yet it was of the very same essence and nature with it, and therefore also might possibly come to be in like manner purified and made incombustible.&lt;br /&gt;
And when I have brought him thus far, then I may speak unto him of the several properties of our fine copper, and leave him to compare them with those of that coarse sort which is only known to him. And here if I could give him an exact calculation of the weight of a cubical inch of the Peruvian Copper, comparing it with a cubical inch of the Gothick and showing the preponderancy of that above this, I should settle in him a just idea as to one property of it. Another property is purity and clarity, which I must in the next place give him to understand by deduction from such ideas or conceptions which he has already admitted. A third is its tincture, and here as I must heighten that idea which he has entertained on one side, so I must lessen it on the other, that this man may exactly quadrate with the original. A fourth and main property which I am to tell him of is Fixation, or the immortality and indefectibility of the tincture, life or soul of this metallic body. Besides all which I may in the fifth place discourse to him of the extreme ductability or rarefaction of it; if it might not be too prodigious for his belief; and sixthly, of its medicinal uses and qualities, which would afford me a great variety of matters to entertain him with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus I shall have in some degree satisfied my Tartarian or my Gothick Philosopher, that the fine Copper of Peru is not metaphorical or symbolical, as his poor country men, who have never seen it, would persuade him: but that it is as truly, really and substantially of a metallic nature and consistence, as that which he daily handles for such. And he now begins to understand how this fine copper, which I otherwise call Gold, is compounded of the same (yet better graduated) principles, with a more exact proportion than his, and that it is not metaphorically, but really a metallic substance, more ponderous, and brighter than the other, also of a bitter (though not so deep) Tincture, more fixed and ductile, and lastly more proper for human bodies, to be used internally or externally, when prepared according to Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I take my leave of my Philosopher, and go next to my merchant. Here I shall not have so much to do, as with the former. I need only to mind him in brief of the several properties about which I discoursed my philosopher, and then declare unto him the great and excellent use thereof in commerce, so as more than four hundred times to answer the other in common valuation, and often more than five hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Tis enough, I find you like well the subject that you are upon, but hope it will serve to lead you into one that is far better. Of all that you have now said, nothing will be found to be in vain, when I shall come to examine you. The tables may come perhaps to be turned upon yourself. Wherefore let me persuade you to try thoroughly, whether that be indeed gold, which you believe to be so. But since you have been pleased to satisfy me as to what I demanded, I am now most ready to satisfy you, as to what was propounded; only I must first premise two or three things that I may be understood by you. Wherefore be now attentive and consider well what I am about to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I will be sure Sir, to attend your motion, for I begin to be very jealous, that you have been carrying on all this while some plot to undermine me. But pray let us hear your premises, and I promise to make the best use of all the ears and eyes which I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: The first thing that I wish then to premise is this, That the Divine Blessing was originally spoken forth upon the whole Creation of God. Or as some would rather choose to express it - It was outspoken into the Creation, that is, by a real, vital and essential infusion engrafted into it. So that whatever come out of the hands of God was good. No evil should ever be derived from the Divine Being, who notwithstanding the supreme liberty of Will, is necessitated when He acts, to act according to Goodness. No sin nor death, no barrenness or drought, no weakness or disproportion could at all proceed from him. Wherefore he rejoicing, as it were, in the works of his hands, pronounced them both severally and universally to be good, yea very good, as considered in their whole system, and harmonious union with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I must grant that you say. But I would fain see to what purpose It will serve you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: You may yet, before we part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I cannot deny but that God blessed the whole Creation and that all the works of his hands are good. Make your best of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: The second thing that I have to premise is but as a corollary from the former, and is strengthened by universal experience. It is this, The Works of the Creation are not Now in the same State, as they were when they first came out of the hands of God, or as when the Divine Blessing was pronounced upon them, or outspoken onto them, yet with this limitation, so far as they are within our Sphere or Orb. For experience doth at this day too sufficiently attest that the creatures, whether they be of the animal, vegetable or mineral kingdom, cannot be all said to be good, howsoever they be considered, either separately by themselves, or conjunctly in harmony with the rest. And whatever may be pleaded on their behalf by some acute philosophers and divines, that all the creatures are, even at this day, good; though not positively, yet relatively, and with respect both to their present constitution and the constitution of the world in general, it is evident, to me at least, if either the undoubted records of scripture, or the natural light of reason may judge of the appeal, that all that they can say will, if it prove any thing, certainly conduce to the very overturning of the positive goodness of the Divine Being,and the introducing in the room thereof a certain relative, hypothetical and imaginary goodness, and to the building up a very odd and irregular system of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This if it were necessary, I might at large deduce through several particulars, proving the absurdity and inconsistency of such a supposition, that has been taken up of late by some men of name, and by them too mush authorised to the dishonour of God, though they might not perhaps design it so, as I am apt both to hope and believe. But this would lead me out very far and keep me too long from the resolution of the question in hand. However, Philochrysus, if at any other time you think it worth your while to demand a particular satisfaction as to this point, I shall be most willing to give it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I thank you, Philadelphus. At present I am well enough satisfied in this matter; yea so much as I have often with my self admired, even when bit by a flea, how any could be serious in pleading for the perfection of the present constitution of the World of Nature, as if it never had been better, or was never to be better; but after it shall have lasted out such a term, that it must return back again into its primitive state of nothingness; by the most dreadful dissolution through Fire. This their catastrophe of Our World, I must confess, did never very well please me; but did always stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Its is then granted by you that the present constitution of this terrestrial world in which we live, is not so perfect and good as it was originally brought forth by God, and that it may, by the gift of god, recover again its original constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: It is granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Well! Answer me now this one question. Which do you now think best deserves to be called by this or that name, that which is most perfect in its kind, and that which comes up most really to the true and original frame of its nature, or that which falls short of it, and is very Imperfect as to its kind?&lt;br /&gt;
As for instance, you take two sheep, or two horses, and of these let one be placed at the right hand and the other at the left. Suppose now the horse at the right hand to have all the most excellent features and proportions of an horse, and that at the left to have none of them at all, but to be very mean and despicable. Suppose also the sheep at the right hand, to be very plump and fat, and to wear a Golden Fleece upon its back, and that at the left to be lean, deformed and leprous. Will you hereupon say that the horse at the left hand is a real horse, but that at the right a metaphorical one? Or that the sheep at the left is a true sheep, but not that at the right? And will you not rather say that these by approaching nearer to the perfection of their nature, and to the original integrity and beauty in which they were first both brought forth from the Divine exemplar, do less deserve to be called figurative or allegorical than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: So indeed it seems to me, if either of these may be called a figurative sheep, or a figurative horse, it must be the left-handed ones, who come not up to the primitive constitution of their nature, into which the divine blessing was spoken, but have fallen under the curse, and suffered the depravation of their first pure form, according to the supposition that is granted you. And if any one had ever seen such an other but such lean and deformed sheep, or such ill conditioned and disproportioned jakes, verily I say should much condemn his rashness, if he should say there were no other, but positively conclude these to be the best of the kind, and that above them are but hypothetical metaphors, or poetical expressions of somewhat transcending nature. Yea I should be a little angry if he should be so obstinate as to stand out against the authentic relations of ocular witness, or go to oblige me to deny my own senses, because his have not had the same experience which mine also had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Suppose also that you have two bushels of wheat, the one whereof is half full of chaff, the other perfectly cleansed, the one blighted, the other large grained and sound. Would you say that the blighted and chaffy corn is only real and substantial, but the sound and the cleansed to be no more than a metaphor or a shadow. I believe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose once more that you have two pips of Spanish wine, the one natural and unsophisticated, clean and sprightly, the other pipe sophisticated and filled up half with water: and that you have tasted only of the latter. Would you say that this only is true wine, and not the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: No, Philadelphus, I think I should not so far expose my own judgment. And though I should not have tasted of the finest wine, yet would I not say there is no better than that I have tasted; and assert that what I am told of the other is only fancy or figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Now my dear Philochrysus, Hold to your words. For I see two pieces of gold, the one as at your right hand, the other is at your left, the one celestial gold, the other terrestrial gold, like as there are bodies celestial and bodied terrestrial. The gold of your left hand you see and handle, and say therefore that it is substantial. The gold of the right hand you see not neither can you handle, and conclude therefore that it is shadowy. The reason whereof is this. The former has a peculiar virtue in it to blind that eye by which the former Gold may be discerned, and to induce such a paralytic numbness and deadness on all one part of the man that has a lust after it, that he cannot possibly feel or handle the other till his disease be first removed from him. But as for me, that Gold which you call substantial, I should of the two rather choose to call shadowy Gold, and that which you think to be shadowy and figurative, I must call substantial and real, on far greater reasons than you have produced to move me to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I cannot but believe my senses. You shall not easily persuade me out of them. For if they deceive me, I can be certain of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Be not afraid: you may keep your senses still for me. Since the senses deceive none; but it is the judgment which is made upon them that may be erroneous. Take care therefore that you judge not amiss, and think that to be in the object itself which is nothing but an impression produced by it upon the sensory. But tell me, do you ever dream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: Yes I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: You may then remember how you thought that you have seen, felt and handled various objects which have vanished away as soon as you awakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I do. And particularly I call to mind, how I have sometime thought myself to be rolling among bags of gold. So that it has been no small trouble to me to find myself undeceived in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Forget not this. The application will not be difficult, and very nearly concerns you, my friend. Philochrysus, you are in a dream at this very instant, and you will certainly find yourself undeceived in the morning, when your senses that are now locked up in sleep shall recover themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: In a dream say you? Nay, then the whole world is a dream. All that I do is dream and fancy, and whatever I behold or handle is but a shadow. Will you make all the world beside yourself to be in a dream? Will you make all the hurly-burlies in it, all the traffickings, negotiations, and wars, with all manner of transactions, private and public, civil and religious, to be nothing more but the sportive imaginations of the night? Will you make nothing to be real or substantial of what is seen, felt , heard or understood by us poor mortals? Sure,Phildelphus, you are no sceptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: No, I am an eclectic. But yet I have found the good of scepticism, as to many things that you believe. And if it go not too far, it is the foundation of all solid knowledge, natural, political or divine. Wherefore, however strange it may appear to you, it is not very far from the truth, to say that this world, with all that is in it, is but a dream or a shadow when compared with the invisible worlds. I am afraid to press you too much with these matters, and therefore I only said it is not very far from the truth to say so, but the indubitable records wherein in manifestly the finger of God, would bear me out, if I should say that it is the very truth itself. Search into these and you will find enough to open your eyes and let you see that the form of this World passeth away, and that all that belongs to it is no more than as a vision of the might, which flies away with the day break. My thoughts have been formerly the same with yours: the poisoned cup from the hand of the Fair Harlot, whom I have mentioned to you, cast me into a deep sleep. And in it I remember, I had just the same dreams which you have now. I thought terrestrial gold was as substantial as you imagine it to be, and of the celestial gold I had no manner of apprehension; but was contented to look on it as a figure and not as a substance. But I was roused out of my sleep by a swift messenger out of the Heavenly Philadelphia, upon which all the enchanted scenes of the night immediately fled away, and I awakened recovering the senses which had been before chained up, and then I quickly perceived my errors. Ah! Philochrysus! Awake! Awake! There stands now at your right hand one of the citizens of that beautiful city, who holds before him a medal made of the same gold, which he would present to you, if you would but suffer your eyes to be opened, and would not hold so fast the shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: What mean you to do with me? Oh! A little more sleep, a little more slumber, a little more of this worlds, and then I awake. Disturb me not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: He talks in his sleep. Ho! Ho! Philochrysus. You will not yet be awakened I find. I will therefore for a little time grant you your hearts desire, and this once, suppose that you are not asleep while you sleep, but that your dream is a reality, and all the conclusions that you have made from the exercise of your outward senses to be true. For by parity of reason (even granting what you say) as you do conclude the terrestrial gold to be true, real and substantial, I do conclude the celestial to be so, and much more so. If you plead sensation for yours, I know those that plead it for ours, and that deserve as much (at least) to be believed as any that you bring. But lest you might not so readily believe or apprehend perhaps the witnesses that I could produce, I will proceed with you as you would do with your Goth or Tartar, that had never heard of the gold mines of Peru. Wherefore I must needs tell you that if the Peruvian gold be true gold, then the Philadelphian gold deserves also of right so to be called, yea is much better qualified of the two to bear this name, as it is more perfect in its kind, and as it more nearly approaches then the former to the true and original frame of pure and undefiled nature, exactly compounded according to the divine exemplar, and duly concocted in the bowels of the everlasting mountains, the mountains of the Sun and the Mountains of the Moon. Whence, supposing the difference of Philadelphian and Peruvian Gold to be, as the difference of Peruvian and Gothic Copper; this will not hinder but that the Philadelphian Gold, both according to the greater purity of its constituent principles (as without the least alloy of the curse) and the most exact proportion of then, may well deserve to be looked on no less real than the Peruvian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: If it be so, pray dear Philadelphus, give me some of it, that I may make a proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: You are not yet out of your dream, you know not what you say. For you neither understand what manner of Gold this is, neither who it is that can give it. It may be called to you by a thousand names, but I do assure you that it is true and proved gold. And let me tell you that your gold, or the false brass of Peru, is not constituted of Principles altogether pure and defected, but mixed with some close and inherent imperfections. Neither are the proportions adjusted according to perfect Nature, but only according to the perfect constitution of this terrestrial orb. The curse that has entered into the whole lower Creation has also entered into this, and it is not a perfect metal, except with respect to the lapsed and broken frame of this our Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: Hah! Philadelphus! I am wondering where you will run at last. I am not so much in a dream, but I can laugh at these amusements of yours. Did ever any before deny Gold to be a perfect metal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Mistake me not. I do not deny it to be a perfect metal with respect to the present order of things in their Fallen State. But I do positively aver that it is not a perfect metal with respect to that primitive and original order of Beings which proceeded immediately from God through His Word, wherein and whereby they subsist; but that it partakes of the curse, as well as all the other subjects of the mineral or metallic kingdom, though not in the same degree. Now there is an Inherent curse, and there is also an Adherent Curse, and of both of these it more or less participates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: Pray what do you mean by an Inherent Curse, and how do you appropriate it to the Terrestrial Gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Know what is the Blessing and you cannot fail to know what is the Curse in Nature. There is an Inherent Blessing in every creature, and there is also an Adherent Blessing. Without the former God could never have pronounced them good, and without the latter they could never have been serviceable to man, or to the rest of their fellow creatures. A privation, or loss, in either of these kinds, is called the Curse. And as it has diverse degrees and is variously specified, so takes it up diverse names, as Death, Darkness, Hades, Sheol, the Turba, the Left Hand, the Seed of the Serpent, the Mist out of the Earth, Lilith, Arimanius, Poison, the Blood of the Old Dragon, the Prisons, the North, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benediction now of both kinds may be lessened, hidden or removed either in part of in whole. The Adherent Benediction may possibly admit of a total remove and separation, but the inherent can never do this without the destruction and annihilation of the subject wherein it is. Whence though it may be hid, yet can it never be separated without the entire disunion of its constituent and vital principles. Which are not perishable, but endure the same, notwithstanding all the cortices, veils, and coverings, wherewith they may be overcast or oppressed, and which are said to be under the president-ship of so many evil Angels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold then here is Wisdom to take away the Inherent Curse from the creature, and to cause the disappeared Blessing to reappear, and exert forth itself. Now shall you understand how this curse is to be appropriated to the terrestrial Gold, and how the contrary Blessing is to be predicated of the celestial. But in the first place you are to take notice, that as the inherent is here less than in any other subjects of the same Kingdom and Order, so the Adherent Curse is greater. In the second place you are to observe that the primary and Radical principles being (as to us) invisible in themselves, the secondary and elementary, which may be made visible, can be here only examined into.&lt;br /&gt;
In the third place, I am now to acquaint you that these elementary principles, which I call also Spermatical, as I call the former Seminal, are vastly different in the state of pure and of corrupt Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For in pure nature there is found a bright living crystalline water, full of spirit, power and energy; but in Nature corrupted there is a water that is opposite to this, being without Light, Life, or purity, without spirituality or strength, and void of all benign efficacy. Wherefore as a stagnated pool remote from the sun beams, or as a dead insipid phlegm, is not to be regarded or valued, so likewise there is found a bright, living and crystalline earth (such as hath been, and such as will be, and such as is even at this time, when it appears not, except to some few) which is sometimes compared to fine silver, and is called the Salt of the Earth. And in this Blessed earth is locked up the Spirit, Energy and Seed of the Mineral and vegetable kingdoms in their purest constitution, yea and of the animal too. For that it contains in itself the Fire of Nature, by which the wheel of her Magia, according to all the seven forms and spirits is set to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary there is a dull, dead and opaceous earth that is mixed more or less with all terrestrial subjects, and that may by Art be separated from them. This is the Curse of the Earth which must be taken away and dissolved, before the Blessed and new Earth can appear, wherefore it is called the Damned Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I hope you will not say that there is any of what the Chymists call Damned Earth in this our Gold. For I cannot bear the thought of it. Pray therefore explain yourself here a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: It is you yourself that make the particular application, for I did not. And indeed, Sir, I was almost afraid to touch you so near the quick. But if your Gold, Philochrysus, be a terrestrial subject (which you will scarce deny) then I am sure it must have some share of this Damned earth in it. For the Curse has not a command to stop when it came to a mine of Gold, but like a leaven it passed through and through, and infected the whole earth, and all that belonged to it. There might not indeed so much of it here abide as elsewhere, and therefore I said there was less of the Inherent Curse in this, than in any other subject of the same kingdom or order. Yet there is some, and that too very considerable, if either reason or experience may be allowed to pass the judgment. But this would lead us too far into a Philosophical disquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let it suffice at present to consider whether what a vulgar and ordinary artist may be able to give an ocular demonstration of in the greatest part of earthly subjects, an expert master may not be as able to give the same in All?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherefore be not angry, dear sir, at what I have asserted, but learn to bear the thought of what will be so much your disappointment, as to let you see the fair idol of your heart is not so lovely as you have imagined it to be, and that it is not all true gold that glisters in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Damned Earth Terra Damnata et Maledicta that cleaves so fast to it, as is not (easily) to be separated by the refiners art. And I am informed from credible testimonies, that whosoever shall be understanding in heart and skillful in hand, to separate this vile earth from the precious Solar Earth in the body of Terrestrial Gold, shall find the quantity of the former (however small when compared to the inferior metals) to exceed the other. And if what is related concerning the degradation of Gold by an eminent and curious eye-witness of this nation, whom all the philosophical and Christian world stands obliged to (and who had this generous and noble design to vindicate Religion from all sectarian polity or partiality, and to establish it upon solid and immutable grounds, be true; and if also the daily experiments) made even in ordinary laboratories of the possibility of its supergradation and Exaltation, by losing in its weight, and so possessing an higher Tincture and Clarity, may deserve any credit: Then is it certain that it may still arrive to an higher degree both of Fixation and Purity, than it could ever meet with in the Bowels of the Accursed earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whether this can ever be quite set free from its Inherent Curse or no, is not so material to our present purpose. However there is a vein, I can assure you, of Paradisical Gold, which not having been with it infected, is by Moses pronounced to be good, (Genesis 2, 12). And yet even this is no more to be compared with the Philadelphian or Sionitical Gold, than the Peruvian is with it. Hereby you may, in part I hope apprehend what is meant both by the Blessing and the Curse, which are inherent in this Metallic body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I do, I think, pretty well understand you. But pray what do you mean by an Adherent Curse, and how is that to be appropriated to the Terrestrial Gold?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: The Adherent Curse is that which adheres or cleaves to the Creature, by external application, and not by Internal Constitution, or composition. And here by external application I mean not barely any outward abuse of the same whatever, but also (and chiefly) any degree of adhesion of the Human Soul to it, how intrinsic soever, and the more intrinsic still the more dangerous, it being foreign, incongruous, and extrinsic both to the Soul, and to the creature which she seeks to cleave as to her blessing. Now though your terrestrial Gold has indeed not so much of the inherent, yet has it far more of the Adherent Curse, which is much the worst of the two. And though it should be never so perfect as to its composition, that avails not if this other Curse sticks to it. Yea, on the contrary, this will be so much the greater and the heavier, as in the case of the Tartarization [2 Peter, 2, 4.] of those angels who kept not their first estate of adhesion to the Original Beauty and Goodness, and in that of the Golden Calf of Israel, concerning which the Jews have to this very day a celebrated proverb, that no punishment is ever inflicted upon them in which there is not some portion of this calf. And I fear the same may be justly applicable not to them alone. What Evil of Sin is there in the whole world that is not perpetrated for the sake of it? And what Evil of pain, or dreadful judgments by the Divine nemesis have not already been pulled down upon particular persons, upon families and upon whole kingdoms? Behold, and consider the times of old; what examples all histories both sacred and profane doth give you. To conclude, how many are there that for the sake of this, labour the greatest part of their lives in the very fire, who at length reap nought but smoke and dross, in the room of those Golden Mountains which they hereby imagined to themselves? And how many weary themselves all their lives for very vanity, while being deceived with the false show of an adhering blessing, they find only misery and repentance; who, had they taken but half that pains to discover the Paradisical or Philadelphian mine of Gold, would never have been left in such plunges at the last? Behold all this proceeds from its Adherent Curse. Remember, prithee Philochrysus, the dying aphorism of the richest Subject of the world at that time, as well as the best politician, and the most faithful servant; which famous aphorism is, I suppose, not unknown to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: You mean, I know the saying of that great man, which he left in his legacy to posterity: Had I but taken but half that pains to serve my God, as I took to serve my Prince, he would not now have deserted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: I do so. And withal I assure you, my good friend, that if you were but half as diligent in seeking after the celestial, as you are in seeking after the terrestrial Gold, you would be experimentally convinced that I have spoken nothing to you all this while but the very Truth, and you would find yourself possessed of substance instead of vanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I am at a loss. I know not what to make of that which you say. Disturb me not out of my sleep. For I would rather dream on at the old rate, than be molested. Have pity on me, and depart from me. For I am Philochrysus. I am a lover of that what you have contemptibly nick-named terrestrial Gold. The which to me is a Celestial substance. But you will hardly allow it to be a substance at all, that so you may the more exalt the Gold (as you call it) of your own country, which I must call imaginary. Tell me not then that mine is vanity, or the shadow only of a substance. Neither speak to me of labouring for smoke and dross. I know what is substance, I thank my stars, and I can distinguish between what is true and what is counterfeit. Mine hath been tried in the Fire, and weighed in the balance. It hath stood in the one; and in the other hath been found to have its just weight. Can you also pretend to this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Yes, more than pretend. Mine is indeed Gold tried in the Fire, and it has been also weighed in the balance as well as yours. And let me tell you besides, that your gold shall never be able to endure this fire-trial, but shall fly away in it as lead and dross. And one grain of the Gold of my City if put into the balance will preponderate this whole room full of yours. Whence the Crown that is mad out of this Gold is called emphatically a weight of Glory and an Hyperbolical or excessive weight, yea a far exceeding and Hyperbolically Hyperbolical weight [2 Corinthians 4,17.] So far exceeds the celestial Gold in preponderosity the terrestrial Gold when weighed together, as no hyperbole can reach. It exceeds in like manner in clarity and lustre, in fixation and permanency, in the superexcellency of its Tincture, in ductibility and divisibility; and in all manner of medicinal uses both for Spirit, Soul and Body, all which it revives, exhilarates and perfects. And in the last place all the merchandise of your World is not to be compared with it. This alone can truly and really and lastingly make you rich. It would not be difficult to particularize each of these, and to show hereby the reality and substantiality of this Gold that I plead for, not only equally with, but far above that which is dug out of the Earth. But all that can be said hereupon, would but serve so much the more to exasperate you if you comprehend it not, or will not attend to it. In vain therefore would it be for me to give you (at present) a particular description of its several properties, as also of its constituent principles and the manner of their union. I must wait to do that till those senses which are fallen asleep in you shall come to be awakened. But I am therefore sent that I might rouse you out of your sleep. Forgive me that I thus wake you. O Philochrysus! what has become of the eye-salve of Sophia? Arise and anoint your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: Hold! I think I now begin to see. I must confess that I can now see the possibility of what you drive at, but that it is actually so, I cannot yet perceive. I remember I was once a little acquainted with one that might possibly be of your society, and I did hear him exclaim from the pulpit in this manner: &amp;quot;Think ye, ye shall be set up as pillars in the Temple of God to uphold it? or that you shall be full of gold in you pockets, of the finest gold tried in the Fire, like the rich men of the Earth? and to ruffle it in silks, and fine raiment as those in princes&#39; courts? Do you think that these things are here meant in these promises made to the Seven Churches? No, No, dream of no such things, for I say there is not one word true according to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: I do say that every word, every syllable, every letter is true, and that there are real and substantial pillars in the Temple of God, real and substantial Gold in the City of God, and real and substantial raiment worn by the citizens thereof. And yet at the same time, I do assert that there is no Word, syllable or letter true, if strictly taken according to that low idea which the natural man has fixed to these words. For as much as there is a more than hyperbolical excess in the difference of one from the other. As each property by itself considered will manifest. And if you are convinced of the possibility (at least) of what I have said, you must acknowledge the actual existence hereof. For that there can be no other reason invented whereby you deny it, but its impossibility and inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I resign therefore, and yield to you, that the City of Philadelphia may be built of true, real and substantial Gold, which has nothing of the curse either Inherent or Adherent sticking to it, according to the sense that the describer means, or that you explain, though not according to that which the natural man would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: You comprehend me right. I shall therefore proceed. I said then, in the second place, that it is built of fine Gold, much more fine and higher graduated than any you can ever have seen. This you may in part already understand by what has been said hitherto. But here I shall much more stand in need of words whereby to express myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I long greatly to hear you speak distinctly of this Superfine and supergraduated Gold. I shall not forget what you have said. Therefore proceed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: You need but remember your Gothic philosopher. Consider also that there is a twofold body, There is a material and elementary body, and there is an spiritual and a heavenly body. The one is gross, the other fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I can understand perfectly what you mean by the former, but the notion of an immaterial body seems to me the very same contradiction as that of an immaterial substance seemed to an eminent asserter of materialism called Philautus. If you had but him to deal with, he would make work, I believe, with your non-elementary and spiritual body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: It may be so. But I never feared the strength of reasoning in Philautus, though I know him pretty well, and all his principles whether in Philosophy, Divinity or politics are opposite to mine. He is the express character of the natural man throughout, and in his works everywhere you have the most lively image of the Fallen State of Nature, whereof great advantage may be made by the wise, it being no where that I know so deeply and philosophically handled. This indeed he mistakes for the true and original State of Nature; but herein he speaks well enough, and true enough, as a natural or animal Man, and without deviating, most exactly follows his principles wherever they lead him. On the other side the most learned and profound of all his answerers very admirably both describes and demonstrates the true and original state of Nature, such as it was, and such as it shall be again, but not such as it is at present. As for Philautus he is not dead, but lives in his disciples, and will live as long as the present corrupt state of Nature shall remain upon the Earth. For the Psyche in man is never able to penetrate beyond the image; only the pure spirit of Sophia can reach to the life, which is so imaged out in discourse. Hence he who had only the Psyche, was not able to distinguish betwixt the one and the other, but he took them both to be the same. So finding in the origination of several languages that a Spirit was imaged forth or signified by Breath, he presently concludes that the Spirit and Breath were one and the same, and consequently that all Spirits (as such) were material and corporeal beings. he in the like manner, finding in the verbal image of substance was expressed that which stands under, or props up somewhat, entertained immediately a most gross and sensible conception hereof, and tied it down to matter. So then nothing could be a greater absurdity to him, or a more manifest contradiction, than to believe an immaterial substance, that is an immaterial matter. Now among those who have a great and just abhorrence for his sentiments, all are not set free themselves from the very same method of argumentation, as from a numerous induction of instances might be verified if need were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherefore I shall only beg of you what is highly necessary in order to your understanding of what I speak, and to your passing a judgment thereupon, that you content not yourself with the lax and popular sense of a word, as that which is generally very equivocal, but that you seek out the strict and close idea that is to be affixed to it, for the removal of all ambiguity in the terms, and the distinction of the image from its original, or (as the Schools would rather speak) of the Signum from Signatum, the sign from the thing signified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: It is very just what you require, Phildelphus. None can gainsay this method, after what the celebrated author of An Essay on Human Understanding, together with a French philosopher of the first magnitude , have written on it, shall be looked into. Wherefore tell me in the first place, what you mean by Substance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Hereby I understand that which hath both Essence and Existence, being created by God, and made capable of bearing up, or supporting various modes of Being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: What do you mean by Body?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Hereby I understand a substance that is extended, and is capable of various modes of Extension. Two of which modes are penetrability and impenetrability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: Is penetrability then a mode of extension? I always thought that all matter was impenetrable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: True. All Matter is impenetrable, but all body is not. And penetrability is as much a mode of extension as impenetrability. For where there is no co-extension there is no penetration, and where there is no penetration there can be no life. Without therefore all Nature were dead, it remains that extended substances may be penetrated. Now there are extended substances, or rather one extended substance (of which I may speak to you hereafter) which can penetrate others, but which cannot be penetrated by any. There are also extended substances which can penetrate others by co-extension, and which may themselves also be penetrated by others. lastly there are extended substances or bodies which cannot penetrate others, but which may be penetrated by them. Thus by the outward light of this world, which is a body of the second order, the Earth may be penetrated, which can neither penetrate it or any other substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: What do you mean by Matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Hereby I understand a body that is impenetrable, and divisible, and which is capable of various modes of division. So that all Matter is Body, but all Body is not Matter. By impenetrable I mean not that which cannot be at all penetrated, but I mean that which is not to be penetrated by any thing of its own order, and which itself can penetrate nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: How can the same Body be impenetrable and divisible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Because it is impenetrable, therefore it is divisible into parts. For if it could be penetrated, then would there be no need of division, or separation of the parts? Wherefore that which is penetrable is also indivisible, or rather indiscerpible, and consequently incorruptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I comprehend your meaning. And now I conceive what is your notion of an immaterial or Spiritual Body called likewise a Non-elementary (which is a Quintessential) or heavenly Body; Namely, that it is an extended substance, penetrable, penetrative, indivisible, indiscepible, and incorruptible. As on the contrary your notion of a material and elementary body must be this, that it is an extended substance, impenetrable, penetrated, divisible, discerpible and corruptible. I begin consequently to understand a little your notion of Material and Spiritual, of Elementary and Heavenly Gold, and why you call the one gross and the other fine Gold. But notwithstanding that I conceive how the Material and Elementary Gold is an extended Substance which is impenetrable to all terrestrial bodies, and may be penetrated by the Celestial, which is also divisible into parts, yea Discerpible into the minutest atoms, yet can I not easily yield that it should be corruptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: All that is compounded of Elements must be more or less corruptible. And though certain elementary bodies may have arrived at some degree of incorruptibility, yet it is but a degree, it being impossible for them to be ever perfectly freed from corruption, but by a dissolution and a resuscitation. For this is a most assured maxim, that all things must be perfected upon the cross and all things must be tried by Fire Without passing through the Cross there is no resurrection, without passing through the Fire there is no Fixation or Incorruption, no Purification or Spiritualization. Hence the messenger of the Covenant of Immortality is by a certain prophet compared to a refiners Fire, who saith of him that he shall purify the Priesthood and purge them as Gold that they may rightly offer the sacrifice of Minha to Jehovah. Hence also a great and wise King saith, the word (or outflowing emanation of the Lord is refined; and again he cries out Thy Word is exceedingly refined most fine and pure. And likewise this very Word of the Lord or the Word the Lord saith to the shepherds of Israel: I will refine them as Silver is refined, and will try them as Gold is tried. And elsewhere he saith, I have refined thee melted thee down, and then brought thee out of the furnace. For this cause the precious Sons of Zion are compared to fine gold, and the Angelical man who appeared to Daniel had his loins Girded with fine Gold of Ophir. From this also an account may be given why the Altar of Incense was made of refined Gold, together with the Ark and the Cherubims, also why Wisdom&#39;s oracle is so often compared to fine Gold; and lastly why the Shulamite describes both the head and the feet of her beloved to be as of fine Gold, that is such an indivisible, indiscerpible and incorruptible substance, as being extended is therefore a body, and as possessing all the properties of the material and gross Gold, is therefore a spiritual body, or immaterial and celestial gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: I must confess that I have always taken a spiritual body to be a contradiction in terms, for I never heard otherwise before but that Spirit and Body were contraries. But now I begin to mistrust that I have not been used rightly to apply ideas to words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Your diffidence is well grounded. For I do not find that Spirit and Body are anywhere opposed as contraries in those writings which command the greatest authority and deference above all others to them. I find indeed frequently spirit and flesh to be set as opposites, but spirit and body never. Nay I find it there expressly asserted that there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so in like manner there is a natural Gold and there is a spiritual, which surpasseth the former, as the spiritual Body of the Resurrection doth this Natural and Elementary body which we now wear about us. Moreover the same highly mystic author tells those who being immersed in the flesh had no notion of a Spiritual or Heavenly Body, any more than you had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: There are also Celestial Bodies (of a spiritual and heavenly property) and Bodies Terrestrial (of a material and earthly property as common gold but the Glory of the Celestial is one, and the glory of the Terrestrial is another; that is, the glory of the Philadelphian Gold differs from the glory of the Peruvian, as far as heaven is from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philochrysus: You extremely amaze me, good Philadelphus, to tell me that the City from whence you are named is built of such fine gold. But pray now go on, if you are not weary, to satisfy me in the third place, whether it be built of Transparent and Glassy Gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philadelphus: Be not over hasty, but take time to meditate upon what I (through the assistance of the Good Spirit) have freely communicated to you. Neither have I done yet with the former, for I am not yet come to the top of the ladder with you. Perhaps your head may be giddy in endeavouring to reach it at this present. Wherefore though I cannot be ever weary of discoursing these matters, yet I will now take my leave of you with one parallel instance, which you may digest against we meet the next time. Consider what difference there is betwixt the faeces of any terrestrial subject, from which the spirit is separated, and the Spirit itself of that very subject (which is a Spiritual Body) when seven times rectified; and hereby as in a glass you may discern how far that Gross and Earthly Gold I am speaking of, wherewith the Holy City of my brethren is built. In the meanwhile I shall leave with you this Hieroglyphical figure of a star being the mark of this Gold, and also of the city, showing its constituent parts the Water and Fire of the Philadelphians; it manifold and wonderful properties, how it is formed, and how it is made to multiply itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear reader, at the end of his Tract on Vitriol, Roger Bacon mentions that because of the multiplication of the Tincture that is made from Vitriol, the lover of Art should acquaint himself with the Tract De Oleo Stibii. Therefore I considered that it would be good and useful that the Tract De Oleo Stibii follows next. And if one thoroughly ponders and compares these tinctures with one another, then I have no doubt that one will not finish without exceptional profit. Yet, every lover of Art, should mind always to keep one eye on Nature and the other on Art and manual labour. For, when these two do not stand together, then it is a lame work, as when someone thinks he can walk a long path on one leg only, which is easily seen to be impossible,&lt;br /&gt;
Vale.&lt;/p&gt;

De Oleo Antimonii Tractatus.
ROGERII BACONIS ANGLI
Summi Philosophi &amp;amp; Chemici.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stibium, as the Philosophers say, is composed from the noble mineral Sulphur, and they have praised it as the black lead of the Wise. The Arabs in their language, have called it Asinat vel Azinat, the alchemists retain the name Antimonium. It will however lead to the consideration of high Secrets, if we seek and recognize the nature in which the Sun is exalted, as the Magi found that this mineral was attributed by God to the Constellation Aries, which is the first heavenly sign in which the Sun takes its exaltation or elevation to itself. Although such things are thrown to the winds by common people, intelligent people ought to know and pay more attention to the fact that exactly at this point the infinitude of secrets may be partly contemplated with great profit and in part also explored. Many, but these are ignorant and unintelligent, are of the opinion that if they only had Stibium, they would get to it by Calcination, others by Sublimation, several by Reverberation and Extraction, and obtain its great Secret, Oil, and Perfectum Medicinam. But I tell you, that here in this place nothing will help, whether Calcination, Sublimation, Reverberation nor Extraction, so that subsequently a perfect Extraction of metallic virtue that translates the inferior into the superior, may profitably come to pass or be accomplished. For such shall be impossible for you. Do not let yourselves be confused by several of the philosophers who have written of such things, i.e., Geber, Albertus Magnus, Rhasis, Rupecilla, Aristoteles and many more of that kind. And this you should note. Yes, many say, that when one prepares Stibium to a glass, then the evil volatile Sulphur will be gone, and the Oil, which may be prepared from the glass, would be a very fixed oil, and would then truly give an ingress and Medicine of imperfect metals to perfection. These words and opinions are perhaps good and right, but that it should be thus in fact and prove itself, this will not be. For I say to you truly, without any hidden speech; if you were to lose some of the above mentioned Sulphur by the preparation and the burning, as a small fire may easily damage it, so that you have lost the right penetrating spirit, which should make our whole Antimonii corpus into a perfect red oil, so that it also can ascend over the helm with a sweet smell and very beautiful colors and the whole body of this mineral with all its members, without loss of any weight, except for the foecum, shall be an oil and go over the helm. And note also this: How would it be possible for the body to go into an oil, or give off its sweet oil, if it is put into the last essence and degree? For glass is in all things the outermost and least essence. For you shall know that all creatures at the end of the world, or on the last and coming judgement of the last day, shall become glass or a lovely amethyst and this according to the families of the twelve Patriarchs, as in the families of jewels which Hermes the Great describes in his book: As we have elaborately reported and taught in our book de Cabala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall also know that you shall receive the perfect noble red oil, which serves for the translation of metals in vain, if you pour acetum correctum over the Antimonium and extract the redness. Yes not even by Reverberation, and even if its manifold Beautiful colors show themselves, this will not make any difference and is not the right way. You may indeed obtain and make an oil out of it, but it has no perfect force and virtue for transmutation or translation of the imperfect metals into perfection itself. This you must certainly know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-now-we-proceed-to-the-manual-labour-and-thus-the-practica-follows.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;AND NOW WE PROCEED TO THE MANUAL LABOUR, AND THUS THE PRACTICA FOLLOWS. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#and-now-we-proceed-to-the-manual-labour-and-thus-the-practica-follows.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take in the Name of God and the Holy Trinity, fine and well cleansed Antimonii ore, which looks nice, white, pure and internally full of yellow rivulets or veins. It may also be full of red and blue colors and veins, which will be the best. Pound and grind to a fine powder and dissolve in a water or Aqua Regis, which will be described below, finely so that the water may conquer it. And note that you should take it out quite soon after the solution so that the water may conquer it. And note that you should take it out quite soon after the solution so that the water will have no time to damage it, since it quickly dissolves the Antimonii Tincture. For in its nature our water is like the ostrich, which by its heat digests and consumes all iron; for given time, the water would consume it and burn it to naught, so that it would only remain as an idle yellow earth, and then it would be quite spoilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider by comparison Luna, beautiful clean and pure, dissolved in this our water. And let it remain therein for no more than a single night when the water is still strong and full of Spirit,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I tell you, that your good Luna has then been fundamentally consumed and destroyed and brought to nought in this our water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you want to reduce it to a pure corpus again, then you will not succeed, but it will remain for you as a pale yellow earth, and occasionally it may run together in the shape of a horn or white horseshoe, which may not be brought to a corpus by any art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore you must remember to take the Antimonium out as soon as possible after the Solution, and precipitate it and wash it after the custom of the alchemists, so that the matter with its perfect oil is not corroded and consumed by the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-water-wherein-we-dissolve-the-antimonium-is-made-thus:&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE WATER; WHEREIN WE DISSOLVE THE ANTIMONIUM, IS MADE THUS: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-water-wherein-we-dissolve-the-antimonium-is-made-thus:&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Vitriol one and a half (alii 2. lb.) Sal armoniac one pound, Arinat (alii Alun) one half pound / Sal niter one and a half pound, Sal gemmae (alii Sal commune) one pound, Alumen crudum (alii Entali) one half pound. These are the species that belong to and should be taken for the Water to dissolve the Antimonium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take these Species and mix them well among each other, and distill from this a water, at first rather slowly. For the Spiritus go with great force,, more than in other strong waters. And beware of its spirits, for they are subtle and harmful in their penetration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you now have the dissolved Antimony, clean and well sweetened, and its sharp waters washed out, so that you do not notice any sharpness any more, then put into a clean vial and overpour it with a good distilled vinegar. Then put the vial in Fimum Equinum, or Balneum Mariae, to putrefy forty (al.i four) days and nights, and it will dissolve and be extracted red as blood. Then take it out and examine how much remains to be dissolved, and decant the clear and pure, which will have a red colour, very cautiously into a glass flask. Then pour fresh vinegar onto it, and put it into Digestion as before, so that that which may have remained with the faecibus, it should thus have ample time to become dissolved. Then the faeces may be discarded, for they are no longer useful, except for being scattered over the earth and thrown away. Afterwards pour all the solutions together into a glass retort, put into Balneum Mariae, and distill the sharp vinegar rather a fresh one, since the former would be too weak, and the matter will very quickly become dissolved by the vinegar. Distill it off again, so that the matter remains quite dry. Then take common distilled water and wash away all sharpness, which has remained with the matter from the vinegar, and then dry the matter in the sun, or otherwise by a gentle fire, so that it becomes well dried. It will then be fair to behold, and have a bright red color. The Philosophers, when they have thus prepared our Antimonium in secret, have remarked how its outermost nature and power has collapsed into its interior, and its interior thrown out and has now become an oil that lies hidden in its innermost and depth, well prepared and ready. And henceforth it cannot, unto the last judgement, be brought back to its first essence. And this is true, for it has become so subtle and volatile, that as soon as it senses the power of fire, it flies away as a smoke with all its parts because of its volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several poor and common Laborers, when they have prepared the Antimonium thus, have taken one part out, to take care of their expenses, so that they may more easily do the rest of the work and complete it, They then mixed it with one part Salmiac, one part Vitro (alii. Nitro, alii. Titro), one part Rebohat, to cleanse the Corpera, and then proceeded to project this mixture onto a pure Lunam. And if the Luna was one Mark, they found two and a half Loth good gold after separation; sometimes even more. And therewith they had accomplished a work providing for their expenses, so that they might even better expect to attain to the Great Work. And the foolish called this a bringing into the Lunam, but they are mistaken. For such gold is not brought in by the Spiritibus (alii. Speciebus), but any Luna contains two Mark gold to the Loth, some even more. But this gold is united to the Lunar nature to such a degree that it may not be separated from it, neither by Aquafort, nor by common Antimonium, as the goldsmiths know. When however the just mentioned mixture is thrown onto the Lunam in flux, then such a separation takes place that the Luna quite readily gives away her implanted gold either in Aquafort or in Regal, and lets herself separate from it, strikes it to the ground and precipitates it, which would or might otherwise not happen. Therefore it is not a bringing into the Lunam, but a bringing out of the Luna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are coming back to our Proposito and purpose of our work, for we wish to have the Oil, which has only been known and been acquainted with this magistry, and not by the foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you then have the Antimonium well rubified according to the above given teaching, then you shall take a well rectified Spiritum vini, and pour it over the red powder of Antimony, put it in a gentle Balneum Mariae to dissolve for four days and nights, so that everything becomes well dissolved. If however something should remain behind, you overpour the same with fresh Spiritu vini, and put it into the Balneum Mariae again, as said before, and everything should become well dissolved. And in case there are some more faeces there, but there should be very little, do them away, for they are not useful for anything. The Solutiones put into a glass retort, lute on a helm and connect it to a receiver, also well luted, to receive the Spiritus. Put it into Balneum Mariae. Thereafter you begin, in the Name of God, to distill very leisurely at a gentle heat, until all the Spiritus Vini has come over. You then pour the same Spiritum that you have drawn off, back onto the dry matter, and distill it over again as before. And this pouring on and distilling off again, you continue so often until you see the Spiritum vini ascend and go over the helm in all kinds of colours. Then it is time to follow up with a strong fire, and a noble blood red Oleum will ascend, go through the tube of the helm and drip into the recipient. Truly, this is the most secret way of the Wise to distill the very highly praised oil of Antimonii, and it is a noble, powerful, fragrant oil of great virtue, as you will hear below in the following. But here I wish to teach and instruct you who are poor and without means to expect the Great Work in another manner; not the way the ancients did it by separating the gold from the Luna. Therefore take this oil, one lot, [ancient weight unit used for the weighing of gold and silver coins - about 1/30 pound] eight lot of Saturn calcined according to art, and carefully imbibe the oil, drop by drop, while continuously stirring the calx Saturni. Then put it ten days and nights in the heat, in the furnace of secrets, and let the fire that this furnace contains, increase every other day by one degree. The first two days you give it the first degree of fire, the second two days you give it the second degree, and after four days and nights you put it into the third degree of fire and let it remain there for three days and nights. After these three days you open the window of the fourth degree, for which likewise three days and nights should be sufficient. Then take it out, and the top of the Saturnus becomes very beautiful and of a reddish yellow colour. This should be melted with Venetian Boreas. When this has been done, you will find that the power of our oil has changed it to good gold. Thus you will again have subsistence, so that you may better expect the Great Work. We now come back to our purpose where we left it earlier. Above you have heard, and have been told to distill the Spiritum vini with the Oleum Antimonii over the helm into the recipient as well as the work of changing the Saturnum into gold. But now we wish to make haste and report about the second tinctural work. Here it will be necessary to separate the Spiritum vini from the oil again, and you shall know that it is done thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the mixture of oil and wine spirit put it into a retort, put on a helm, connect a receiver and place it all together into the Balneum Mariae. Then distill all the Spiritum vini from the oil, at a very gentle heat, until you are certain that no more Spiritus vini is to be found within this very precious oil. And this will be easy to check; for when you see several drops of Spiritu vini ascend over the helm and fall into the recipient, this is the sign that the Spiritus vini has become separated from the oil. Then remove the fire from the Balneo, though it was very small, so that it may cool all the sooner. Now remove the recipient containing the Spiritu vini, and keep it in a safe place, for it is full of Spiritus which it has extracted from the oil and retained. It also contains admirable virtues, as you will hear hereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the Balneo you will find the blessed bloodred Oleum Antimonii in the retort, which should be taken out very carefully. The helm must be very slowly removed, taking care to soften and wash off the Lute, so that no dirt falls down into the beautiful red oil and makes it turbid. This oil you must store with all possible precaution so that it receives no damage. For you now have a Heavenly Oil that shines on a dark night and emits light as from a glowing coal. And the reason for this is that its innermost power and soul has become thrown out unto the outermost, and the hidden soul is now revealed and shines through the pure body as a light through a lantern: Just as on Judgement Day our present invisible and internal souls will manifest through our clarified bodies, that in this life are impure and dark, but the soul will then be revealed and seen unto the outermost of the body, and will shine as the bright sun. Thus you now have two separate things: Both the Spirit of Wine full of force and wonder in the arts of the human body: And then the blessed red, noble, heavenly Oleum Antimonii, to translate all diseases of the imperfect metals to the Perfection of gold. And the power of the Spiritual Wine reaches very far and to great heights. For when it is rightly used according to the Art of Medicine: I tell you, you have a heavenly medicine to prevent and to cure all kinds of diseases and ailments of the human body. And its uses are thus, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;against-podagra-or-gout&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;AGAINST PODAGRA or GOUT &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#against-podagra-or-gout&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of gout one should let three drops of this Spiritu vini, that has received the power of the Antimony, fall into a small glass of wine. This has to be taken by the patient on an empty stomach at the very moment in time when he sense the beginning or arrival of his trouble, bodily ailment and pain. On the next day and afterwards on the third day it should also be taken and used in the same way. On the first day it takes away all pain, however great it may be, and prevents swelling. On the second day it causes a sweat that is very inconstant, viscous and thick, that smells and tastes quite sour and offensive, and occurs mostly where the joints and limbs are attached. On the third day, regardless of whether any medicine has been taken, a purging takes place of the veins into the bowels, without any inconvenience, pain or grief. And this demonstrates a great power of Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;against-leprosy&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;AGAINST LEPROSY &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#against-leprosy&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with the patient is given six drops on an empty stomach. And arrange it so that the unclean person is alone without the company of any healthy people, in a separate and convenient place. For his whole body will soon begin to smoke and steam with a stinking mist or vapor. And on the second day his skin will start to flake and much uncleanliness will detach itself from his body. He should then have three more drops of the medicine ready, which he should take and use in solitude on the fourth day. Then on the eighth or ninth day, by means of this medicine and through the bestowal of Divine mercy and blessing, he will be completely cleansed and his health restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;against-apoplexia-or-stroke&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;AGAINST APOPLEXIA OR STROKE &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#against-apoplexia-or-stroke&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of stroke, let a drop of the unadmixed tincture fall onto the tongue of the person in need. At once it will raise itself and distribute itself like a mist or smoke, and rectify and dissolve the struck part. But if the stroke has hit the body or other members, he should be given three drops at the same time in a glass of good wine, as previously taught in the case of Podagra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of dropsy give one drop each day for six days in a row, in Aqua Melissae or Valerianae. On the seventh day give three drops in good wine. Then it is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of the falling sickness, give him two drops at the beginning of the Paroxismi in Aqua Salviae, and after three hours again two drops. This will suffice. But if further symptoms should occur, then give him two more drops as above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of consumption and dehydration, give him two drops in Aqua Violarum the first day. On the second day, give him two more drops in good wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases of all kinds of hot fevers, give him three drops in a well distilled St. Johnswort water or Cichorii at the beginning of the Paroxismi. Early in the morning on the following day, again give him three drops in good wine on an empty stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of pestilence give the patient seven drops in a good wine, and see to it that the infected person is all by himself, and caused to sweat. Then this poison will, with Divine assistance, do him no harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take and give at the beginning and entry of spring, when the sun has entered the sign of Aries, two drops; and at the beginning with God&#39;s help, be safe and protected against bad health and poisoned air, unless the incurred disease was predestined and fatally imposed upon man by the Almighty God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we now wish to proceed to the Oleum Antimonii and its Power, and show how this oil may also help the diseased and imperfect metallic bodies. Take in the Name of God, very pure refined gold, as much as you want and think will suffice. Dissolve it in a rectified Wine, prepared the way one usually makes Aquam Vitae. And after the gold has become dissolved, let it digest for a month. Then put it into a Balneum, and distill off the spiritum vini very slowly and gently. Repeat this several times, as long and as often until you see that your gold remains behind in fundo as a sap. And such is the manner and opinion of several of the ancients on how this oil may also help the diseased and imperfect metallic bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

Repeat this several times, as long and as often until you see that your gold remains behind in fundo as a sap. And such is the manner and opinion of several of the ancients on how to prepare the gold. But I will show and teach you a much shorter, better and more useful way. Viz. that you instead of such prepared gold take one part Mercurii Solis, the preparation of which I have already taught in another place by its proper process. Draw off its airy water so that it becomes a subtle dust and calx. Then take two parts of our blessed oil, and pour the oil very slowly, drop by drop onto the dust of the Mercurii Solis, until everything has become absorbed. Put it in a vial, well sealed, into a heat of the first degree of the oven of secrets, and let it remain there for ten days and nights. You will then see your powder and oil quite dry, such that it has become a single piece of dust of a blackish grey colour. After ten days give it the second degree of heat, and the grey and black colour will slowly change into a whiteness so that it becomes more or less white. And at the end of these ten days, the matter will take on a beautiful rose white. But this may be ignored. For this colour is only due to the Mercurio Solis, that has swallowed up our blessed oil, and now covers it with the innermost part of its body. But by the power of the fire, our oil will again subdue such Mercurium Solis, and throw it into its innermost. And the oil with its very bright red colour will rule over it and remain on the outside. Therefore it is time, when twenty years (sic) have passed, that you open the window of the third degree [The alchemical ovens had small openings at different heights, by means of which the heat was regulated.] The external white colour and force will then completely recede inwardly, and the internal red colour will, by the force of the fire, become external. Keep also this degree of fire for ten days, without increase or decrease. You will then see your powder, that was previously white, now become very red. But for the time being this redness may be ignored (is of no consequence), for it is still unfixed and volatile; and at the end of these ten days, when the thirtieth day has passed, you should open the last window of the fourth degree of fire, Let it stay in this degree for another ten days, and this very bright red powder will begin to melt. Let it stay in flux for these ten days. And when you take it out you will find on the bottom a very bright red and transparent stone, ruby colored, melted into the shape of the vial. This stone may be used for Projection, as has been taught in the tract on Vitriol. Praise God in Eternity for this His high revelation, and thank Him in Eternity. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-the-multiplication-lapidis-stibii.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;ON THE MULTIPLICATION LAPIDIS STIBII. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#on-the-multiplication-lapidis-stibii.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient sages, after they had discovered this stone and prepared it to perfect power and translation of the imperfect metals to gold, long sought to discover a way to increase the power and efficiency of this stone. And they found two ways to multiply it: One is a multiplication of its power, such that the stone may be brought much further in its power of Transmutation. And this multiplication is very subtle, the description of which may be found in the Tract on Gold. The second multiplication is an Augmentum quantitatis of the stone with its former power, in such a way that it neither loses any of its power, nor gains any, but in such a manner that its weight increases and keeps on increasing ever more, so that a single ounce grows and increases to many ounces. To achieve this increase or Multiplication one has to proceed in the following manner: Take in the Name of God, your stone, and grind it to a subtle powder, and add as much Mercurii Solis as was taught before. Put these together into a round vial, seal with sigillo Hermetis, and put it into the former oven exactly as taught, except that the time has to be shorter and less now. For where you previously used ten (alii thirty) days, you may now not use more than four (alii ten) days. In other respects the work is exactly the same as before. Praise and thank God the Almighty for His high revelation, and diligently continue your prayers fir His Almighty Mercy and Divine blessings of this Work and Art as well as His granting you a good health and fortuitous welfare. And moreover, take care always to help and counsel the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Epistle of Arisleus, prefixed to the Words of the Sages, concerning the Purport of this Book, for the Benefit of Posterity, and the same being as here follows:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arisleus, begotten of Pythagoras, a disciple of the disciples by the grace of thrice great Hermes, learning from the seat of knowledge, unto all who come after wisheth health and mercy. I testify that my master, Pythagoras, the Italian, master of the wise and chief of the Prophets, had a greater gift of God and of Wisdom than was granted to any one after Hermes. Therefore he had a mind to assemble his disciples, who were now greatly increased, and had been constituted the chief persons throughout all regions for the discussion of this most precious Art, that their words might be a foundation for posterity. He then commanded Iximidrus, of highest council, to be the first speaker, who said:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-dictum.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The First Dictum. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-first-dictum.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iximidrus Saith:- I testify that the beginning of all things is a Certain Nature, which is perpetual, coequalling all things, and that the visible natures, with their births and decay, are times wherein the ends to which that nature brings them are beheld and summoned. Now, I instruct you that the stars are igneous, and are kept within bounds by the air. If the humidity and density of the air did not exist to separate the flames of the sun from living things, then the Sun would consume all creatures. But God has provided the separating air, lest that which He has created should be burnt up. Do you not: observe that the Sun when it rises in the heaven overcomes the air by its heat, and that the warmth penetrates from the upper to the lower parts of the air? If, then, the air did not presently breathe forth those winds whereby creatures are generated, the Sun by its heat would certainly destroy all that lives. But the Sun is kept in check by the air, which thus conquers because it unites the heat of the Sun to its own heat, and the humidity of water to its own humidity. Have you not remarked how tenuous water is drawn up into the air by the action of the heat of the Sun, which thus helps the water against itself? If the water did not nourish the air by such tenuous moisture, assuredly the Sun would overcome the air. The fire, therefore, extracts moisture from the water, by means of which the air conquers the fire itself. Thus, fire and water are enemies between which there is no consanguinity, for the fire is hot and dry, but the water is cold and moist. The air, which is warm and moist, joins these together by its concording medium; between the humidity of water and the heat of fire the air is thus placed to establish peace. rind look ye all how there shall arise a spirit from the tenuous vapour of the air, because the heat being joined to the humour, there necessarily issues something tenuous, which will become a wind. For the heat of the Sun extracts something tenuous out of the air, which also becomes spirit and life to all creatures. All this, however, is disposed in such manner by the will of God, and a coruscation appears when the heat of the Sun touches and breaks up a cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba saith:- Well hast thou described the fire, even as thou knowest concerning it, and thou hast believed the word of thy brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-second-dictum.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Second Dictum. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-second-dictum.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exumedrus saith:- I do magnify the air according to the mighty speech of Iximidrus, for the work is improved thereby. The air is inspissated, and it is also made thin; it grows warm and becomes cold. The inspissation thereof takes place when it is divided in heaven by the elongation of the Sun; its rarefaction is when, by the exaltation of the Sun in heaven, the air becomes warm and is rarefied. It is comparable with the complexion of Spring, in the distinction of time, which is neither warm nor cold. For according to the mutation of the constituted disposition with the altering distinctions of the soul, so is Winter altered. The air, therefore, is inspissated when the Sun is removed from it, and then cold supervenes upon men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereat the Turba said:- Excellently hast thou described the air, and given account of what thou knowest to be therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-third-dictum.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Third Dictum. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-third-dictum.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anaxagoras saith:- I make known that the beginning of all those things which God hath created is weight and proportion, for weight rules all things, and the weight and spissitude of the earth is manifest in proportion; but weight is not found except in body. And know, all ye Turba, that the spissitude of the four elements reposes in the earth; for the spissitude of fire falls into air, the spissitude of air, together with the spissitude received from the fire, falls into water; the spissitude also of water, increased by the spissitude of fire and air, reposes in earth. Have you not observed how the spissitude of the four elements is conjoined in earth! The same, therefore, is more inspissated than all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then saith the Turba:- Thou hast well spoken. Verily the earth is more inspissated than are the rest. Which, therefore, is the most rare of the four elements and is most worthy to possess the rarity of these four?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth:- Fire is the most rare among all, and thereunto cometh what is rare of these four. But air is less rare than fire, because it is warm and moist, while fire is warm and dry; now that which is warm and dry is more rare than the warm and moist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say unto him:- Then which element is of less rarity than air!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth:- Water, since cold and moisture inhere therein, and every cold humid is of less rarity than a warm humid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then do they say unto him:- Thou hast spoken truly. What, therefore, is of less rarity than water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth:- Earth, because it is cold and dry, and that which is cold and dry is of less rarity than that which is cold and moist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras saith:- Well have ye provided, O Sons of the Doctrine, the description of these four natures, out of which God hath created all things. Blessed, therefore, is he who comprehends what ye have declared, for from the apex of the world he shall not find an intention greater than his own! Let us, therefore, make perfect our discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They reply:- Direct every one to take up our speech in turn. Speak thou, O Pandolfus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fourth-dictum.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Fourth Dictum. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fourth-dictum.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Pandolfus saith:- I signify to posterity that air is a tenuous matter of water, and that it is not: separated from it. It remains above the dry earth, to wit, the air hidden in the water, which is under the earth. If this air did not exist, the earth would not remain above the humid water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They answer:- Thou hast said well; complete, therefore, thy speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he continueth:- The air which is hidden in the water under the earth is that which sustains the earth, lest it should be plunged into the said water; and it, moreover, prevents the earth from being overflowed by that water. The province of the air is, therefore, to fill up and to make separation between diverse things, that is to say, water and earth, and it is constituted a peacemaker between hostile things, namely, water and fire, dividing these, lest they destroy one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba saith:- If you gave an illustration hereof, it would be clearer to those who do not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth:- An egg is an illustration, for therein four things are conjoined; the visible cortex or shell represents the earth, and the albumen, for white part, is the water. But a very thin inner cortex is joined to the outer cortex, representing, as I have signified to you, the separating medium between earth and water, namely, that air which divides the earth from the water. The yolk also of the egg represents fire; the cortex which contains the yolk corresponds to that other air which separates the water from the fire. But they are both one and the same air, namely, that which separates things frigid, the earth from the water, and that which separates the water from the fire. But the lower air is thicker than the upper air, and the upper air is more rare and subtle, being nearer to the fire than the lower air. In the egg, therefore, are four things- earth, water, air, and fire. But the point of the Sun, these four excepted, is in the centre of the yolk, and this is the chicken. Consequently, all philosophers in this most excellent art have described the egg as an example, which same thing they have set over their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arisleus saith:- Know that the earth is a hill and not a plain, for which reason the Sun does not ascend over all the zones of the earth in a single hour; but if it were flat, the sun would rise in a moment over the whole earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parmenides saith:- Thou hast spoken briefly, O Arisleus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth: Is there anything the Master has left us which bears witness otherwise? Yet I testify that God is one, having never engendered or been begotten, and that the head of all things after Him is earth and fire, because fire is tenuous and light, and it rules all things on earth, but the earth, being ponderous and gross, sustains all things which are ruled by fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucas saith:- You speak only about four natures; and each one of you observes something concerning these. Now, I testify unto you that all things which God hath created are from these four natures, and the things which have been created out of them return into them, In these living creatures are generated and die, and all things take place as God hath predestinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democritus, the disciple of Lucas, answereth:- Thou hast well spoken, O Lucas, when dealing with the four natures!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then saith Arisleus:- O Democritus, since thy knowledge was derived from Lucas, it is presumption to speak among those who are well acquainted with thy master!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas answereth:- albeit Democritus received from me the science of natural things, that knowledge was derived from the philosophers of the Indies and from the Babylonians; I think he surpasses those of his own age in this learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- When he attains to that age he will give no small satisfaction, but being in his youth he should keep silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucusta saith:- All those creatures which have been described by Lucas are two only, of which one is neither known nor expressed, except by piety, for it is not seen or felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras saith:- Thou hast entered upon a subject which, if completed, thou wilt describe subtly. State, therefore, what is this thing which is neither felt, seen, nor known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- It is that which is not known, because in this world it is discerned by reason without the clients thereof, which are sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. O Crowd of the Philosophers, know you not that it Is only sight which can distinguish white from black, and hearing only which can discriminate between a good and bad word! Similarly, a wholesome odour cannot be separated by reason from one which is fetid, except through the sense of smell, nor can sweetness be discriminated from bitterness save by means of taste, nor smooth from rough unless by touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast well spoken, yet hast thou omitted to treat of that particular thing which is not known, or described, except by reason and piety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saith he:- Are ye then in such haste! Know that the creature which is cognised in none of these five ways is a sublime creature, and, as such, is neither seen nor felt, but is perceived by reason alone, of which reason Nature confesses that God is a partaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They answer:- Thou hast spoken truly and excellently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I will now give a further explanation. Know that this creature, that is to say, the world, hath a light, which is the Sun, and the same is more subtle than all other natures, which light is so ordered that living beings may attain to vision. But if this subtle light were removed, they would become darkened, seeing nothing, except the light of the moon, or of the stars, or of fire, all which are derived from the light of the Sun, which causes all creatures to give light. For this God has appointed the Sun to be the light of the world, by reason of the attenuated nature of the Sun. And know that the sublime creature before mentioned has no need of the light of this Sun, because the Sun is beneath that creature, which is more subtle and more lucid. This light, which is more lucid than the light of the Sun, they have taken from the light of God, which is more subtle than their light. Know also that the created world is composed of two dense things and two rare things, but nothing of the dense is in the sublime creature. Consequently the Sun is rarer than all inferior creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast excellently described what thou hast related. And if, good Master, thou shalt utter anything whereby our hearts may be vivified, which now are mortified by folly, thou wilt confer upon us a great boon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-eighth-dictum.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Eighth Dictum. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-eighth-dictum.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras saith:- I affirm that God existed before all things, and with Him was nothing, as He was at first. But know, all ye Philosophers, that I declare this in order that I may fortify your opinion concerning these four elements and arcana, as well as in the sciences thereof, at which no one can arrive save by the will of God. Understand, that when God was alone, He created four things- fire, air, water, and earth, out of which things He afterwards created all others, both the sublime and the inferior, because He predestinated from the beginning that all creatures extracted from water should multiply and increase, that they might dwell in the world and perform His judgments therein. Consequently, before all, He created the four elements, out of which He afterwards created what He willed, that is to say, diverse creatures, some of which were produced from a single element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba saith:- Which are these, O Master!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- They are the angels, whom He created out of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Turba:- Which, then, are created out of two?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Out of the elements of fire and air are the sun, moon, and stars composed. Hence the angels are more lucid than the sun, moon, and stars, because they are created from one substance, which is less dense than two, while the sun and the stars are created from a composition of fire and air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba saith:- And what concerning the creation of Heaven?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- God created the Heaven out of water and air, whence this is also composed of two, namely, the second of the rarer things, which is air, and the second of the denser things, which is water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- Master, continue thy discourse concerning these three, and rejoice our hearts with thy sayings, which are life to the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other answereth:- I notify to you that God hath further made creatures out of three and out of four; out of three are created flying things, beasts, and vegetables; some of these are created out of water, air, and earth, some out of fire, air, and earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Turba saith:- Distinguish these divers creatures one from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Beasts are created out of fire, air, and earth; dying things out of fire, air, and water, because flying things, and all among vegetables which have a spirit, are created out of water, while all brute animals are from earth, air, and fire. Yet in vegetables there is no fire, for they are created out of earth, water, and air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereat the Turba saith:- Let us assume that a fire, with your reverence&#39;s pardon, does reside in vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Ye have spoken the truth, and I affirm that they contain fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- Whence is that fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth:- Out of the heat of the air which is concealed therein; for I have signified that a thin fire is present in the air, but the elementary fire concerning which you were in doubt is not produced, except in things which have spirit and soul. But out of four elements our father Adam and his sons were created, that is, of fire, air, water, and likewise earth. Understand, all ye that are wise, how everything which God hath created out of one essence dies not until the Day of Judgment. The definition of death is the disjunction of the composite, but there is no disjunction of that which is simple, for it is one. Death consists in the separation of the soul from the body, because anything formed out of two, three, or four components must disintegrate, and this is death. Understand, further, that no complex substance which lacks fire eats, drinks, or sleeps, because in all things which have a spirit fire is that which eats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- How is it, Master, that the angels, being created of fire, do not eat, seeing thou assertest that fire is that which eats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he: Hence ye doubt, each having his opinion, and ye are become opponents, but if ye truly knew the elements, ye would not deny these things. I agree with all whose judgment it is that simple fire eats not, but thick fire. The angels, therefore, are not created out of thick fire, but out of the thinnest of very thin fire; being created, then, of that which is most simple and exceedingly thin, they neither eat, drink, nor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Turba:- Master, our faculties are able to perceive, for by God&#39;s assistance we have exhausted thy sayings, but our faculties of hearing and of sight are unable to carry such great things. May God reward thee for the sake of thy disciples, since it is with the object of instructing future generations that thou hast summoned us together from our countries, the recompense of which thou wilt not fail to receive from the Judge to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arisleus saith:- Seeing that thou hast gathered us together for the advantage of posterity, I think that no explanations will be more useful than definitions of those four elements which thou hast taught us to attain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- None of you are, I suppose, ignorant that all the Wise have propounded definitions in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Should your disciples pass over anything, it becomes you, O Master, to avoid omissions for the sake of future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- If it please you, I will begin the disposition here, since envious men in their books have separated that, or otherwise I will put it at the end of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereat the Turba saith:- Place it where you think it will be dearest for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I will place it where it will not be recognised by the foolish, nor ignored by the Sons of the Doctrine, for it is the key, the perfection and the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eximenus saith:- God hath created all things by his word, having said unto them: Be, and they were made, with the four other elements, earth, water, air, and tire, which He coagulated, and things contrary were commingled, for we see that fire is hostile to water, water hostile to fire, and both are hostile to earth and air. Yet God hath united them peacefully, so that they love one another. Out of these four elements, therefore, are all things created- heaven and the throne thereof; the angels; the sun, moon. and stars; earth and sea, with all things that are in the sea, which indeed are various, and not alike, for their natures have been made diverse by God, and also the creations. But the diversity is more than I have stated; each of these natures is of diverse nature, and by a legion of diversities is the nature of each diverse. Now this diversity subsists in all creatures, because they were created out of diverse elements. Had they been created out of one element, they would have been agreeing natures. But diverse elements being here mingled, they lose their own natures, because the dry being mixed with the humid and the cold combined with the hot, become neither cold nor hot; so also the humid being mixed with the dry becomes neither dry nor humid. But when the four elements are commingled, they agree, and thence proceed creatures which never attain to perfection, except they be left by night to putrefy and become visibly corrupt. God further completed his creation by means of increase, food, life, and government. Sons of the Doctrine, not without purpose have I described to you the disposition of these four elements, for in them is a secret arcanum; two of them are perceptible to the sense of touch and vision, and of these the operation and virtue are well known. These are earth and water. But there are two other elements which are neither visible nor tangible, which yield naught, whereof the place is never seen, nor are their operations and force known, save in the former elements, namely, earth and water; now when the four elements are not commingled, no desire of men is accomplished. But being mixed, departing from their own natures, they become another thing. Over these let us meditate very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Turba:- Master, if you speak, we will give heed to Your words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- I have now discoursed, and that well. I will speak only useful words which ye will follow as spoken. Know, all present, that no true tincture is made except from our copper. Do not therefore, exhaust your brains and your money, lest ye fill your hearts with sorrow. I will give you a fundamental axiom, that unless you turn the aforesaid copper into white, and make visible coins and then afterwards again turn it into redness, until a Tincture: results, verily, ye accomplish nothing. Burn therefore the copper, break it up, deprive it of its blackness by cooking, imbuing, and washing, until the same becomes white. Then rule it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tenth-dictum.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Tenth Dictum. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-tenth-dictum.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arisleus saith:- Know that the key of this work is the art of Coins. Take, therefore, the body which I have shewn to you and reduce it to thin tablets. Next immerse the said tablets in the Water of our Sea, which is permanent Water, and, after it is covered, set it over a gentle fire until the tablets are melted and become waters or Etheliae, which are one and the same thing. Mix, cook, and simmer in a gentle fire until Brodium is produced, like to Saginatum. Then stir in its water of Etheliae until it be coagulated, and the coins become variegated, which we call the Flower of Salt. Cook it, therefore, until it be deprived of blackness, and the whiteness appear. Then rub it, mix with the Gum of Gold, and cook until it becomes red Etheliae. Use patience in pounding lest you become weary. Imbue the Ethelia with its own water, which has preceded from it, which also is Permanent Water, until the same becomes red. This, then, is Burnt Copper, which is the Leaven of Gold and the Flower thereof. Cook the same with Permanent Water, which is always with it, until the water be dried up. Continue the operation until all the water is consumed, and it becomes a most subtle powder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parmenides saith:- Ye must know that envious men have dealt voluminously with several waters, brodiums, stones, and metals, seeking to deceive all you who aspire after knowledge. Leave, therefore, all these, and make the white red, out of this our copper, taking copper and lead, letting these stand for the grease, or blackness, and tin for the liquefaction. Know ye, further, that unless ye rule the Nature of Truth, and harmonize well together its complexions and compositions, the consanguineous with the consanguineous, and the first with the first, ye act improperly and effect nothing, because natures will meet their natures, follow them, and rejoice. For in them they putrefy and are generated, because Nature is ruled by Nature, which destroys it, turns it into dust, reduces to nothing, and finally herself renews it, repeats, and frequently produces the same. Therefore look in books, that ye may know the Nature of Truth, what putrefies it and what renews, what savour it possesses, what neighbours it naturally has, and how they love each other, how also after love enmity and corruption intervene, and how these natures should be united one to another and made at peace, until they become gentle in the fire in similar fashion. Having, therefore, noticed the facts in this Art, set your hands to the work. If indeed, ye know not the Natures of Truth, do not approach the work, since there will follow nothing but harm, disaster, and sadness. Consider, therefore, the teaching of the Wise, how they have declared the whole work in this saying:- Nature rejoices in Nature, and Nature contains Nature. In these words there is shewn forth unto you the whole work. Leave, therefore, manifold and superfluous things, and take quicksilver, coagulate in the body of Magnesia, in Kuhul, or in Sulphur which does not burn; make the same nature white, and place it upon our Copper, when it becomes white. And if ye cook still more, it becomes red, when if ye proceed to coction, it becomes gold. I tell you that it turns the sea itself into red and the colour of gold. Know ye also that gold is not turned into redness save by Permanent Water, because Nature rejoices in Nature.: Reduce, therefore, the same by means of cooking into a humour, until the hidden nature appear. If, therefore, it be manifested externally, seven times imbue the same with water, cooking, imbuing, and washing, until it become red. O those celestial natures, multiplying the natures of truth by the will of God! O that potent Nature, which overcame and conquered natures, and caused its natures to rejoice and be glad! This, therefore, is that special and spiritual nature to which the God thereof can give what fire cannot. Consequently, we glorify and magnify that [species], than which nothing is more precious in the true tincture, or the like in the smallest degree to be found. This is that truth which those investigating wisdom love. For when it is liquefied with bodies, the highest operation is effected. If ye knew the truth, what great thanks ye would give me! Learn, therefore, that while you are tingeing the cinders, you must destroy those that are mixed. For it overcomes those which are mixed, and changes them to its own colour. And as it visibly overcame the surface, even so it mastered the interior. And if one be volatile but the other endure the fire, either joined to the other endures the fire. Know also, that if the vapours have whitened the surfaces, they will certainly whiten the interiors. Know further, all ye seekers after Wisdom, that one matter overcomes four, and our Sulphur alone consumes all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth: Thou hast spoken excellently well, O Parmenides, but thou hast not demonstrated the disposition of the smoke to posterity, nor how the same is whitened!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucas saith: I will speak at this time, following the steps of the ancients. Know, therefore, all ye seekers after Wisdom, that this treatise is not from the beginning of the ruling! Take quicksilver, which is from the male, and coagulate according to custom. Observe that I am speaking to you in accordance with custom, because it has been already coagulated. Here, therefore, is not the beginning of the ruling, but I prescribe this method, namely, that you shall take the quicksilver from the male, and shall either impose upon iron, tin, or governed copper, and it will be whitened. White Magnesia is made in the same way, and the male is converted with it. But forasmuch as there is a certain affinity between the magnet and the iron, therefore our nature rejoices.) Take, then, the vapour which the Ancients commanded you to take, and cook the same with its own body until tin is produced. Wash away its blackness according to custom, and cleanse and roast at an equable fire until it be whitened. But every body is whitened with governed quicksilver, for Nature converts Nature. Take, therefore, Magnesia, Water of Alum, Water of Nitre, Water of the Sea, and Water of Iron; whiten with smoke.: Whatsoever ye desire to be whitened is whitened with this smoke, because it is itself white, and whitens all things. Mix, therefore, the said smoke with its faeces until it be coagulated and become excessively white. Roast this white copper till it germinates of itself, since the Magnesia when whitened does not suffer the spirits to escape, or the shadow of copper to appear, because Nature contains Nature. Take, therefore, all ye Sons of the Doctrine, the white sulphureous nature, whiten with salt and dew, or with the Flower of White Salt, until it become excessively white. And know ye, that the Flower of White Salt is Ether from Ethelia. The same must be boiled for seven days, till it shall become like gleaming marble, for when it has reached this condition it is a very great Arcanum, seeing that Sulphur is mixed with Sulphur, whence an excellent work is accomplished, by reason of the affinity between them, because natures rejoice in meeting their own natures. Take, therefore, Mardek and whiten the same with Gadenbe, that is, wine and vinegar, and Permanent Water. Roast and coagulate until the whole does not liquefy in a fire stronger than its own, namely, the former fire. Cover the mouth of the vessel securely, but let it be associated with its neighbour, that it may kindle the whiteness thereof, and beware lest the fire blaze up, for in this case it becomes red prematurely, and this will profit you nothing, because in the beginning of the ruling you require the white. Afterwards coagulate the same until you attain the red. Let your fire be gentle in the whitening, until coagulation take place. Know that when it is coagulated we call it the Soul, and it is more quickly converted from nature into nature. This, therefore, is sufficient for those who deal with the Art of Coins, because one thing makes it but many operate therein. For ye need not a number of things, but one thing only, which in each and every grade of your work is changed into another nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba saith: Master, if you speak as the Wise have spoken, and that briefly, they will follow you who do not wish to be wholly shut in with darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras saith:- We posit another government which is not from another root, but it differs in name. And know, all ye seekers after this Science and Wisdom, that whatsoever the envious may have enjoined in their books concerning the composition of natures which agree together, in savour there is only one, albeit to sight they are as diverse as possible. Know, also, that the thing which they have described in so many ways follows and attains its companion without fire, even as the magnet follows the iron, to which the said thing is not vainly compared, nor to a seed, nor to a matrix, for it is also like unto these. And this same thing, which follows its companion without fire, causes many colours to appear when embracing it, for this reason, that the said one thing enters into every regimen, and is found everywhere, being a stone, and also not a stone; common and precious; hidden and concealed, yet known by everyone; of one name and of many names, which is the Spume of the Moon. This stone, therefore, is not a stone, because it is more precious; without it Nature never operates anything; its name is one, yet we have called it by many names on account of the excellence of its nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- O! Master! wilt thou not mention some of those names for the guidance of seekers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- It is called White Ethelia, White Copper, and that which flies from the fire and alone whitens copper. Break up, therefore, the White Stone, and afterwards coagulate it with milk. Then pound the calx in the mortar, taking care that the humidity does not escape from the vessel; but coagulate it in the vessel until it shall become a cinder. Cook also with Spume of Luna and regulate. For ye shall find the stone broken, and already imbued with its own water. This, therefore, is the stone which we call by all names, which assimilates the work and drinks it, and is the stone out of which also all colours appear. Take, therefore, that same gum, which is from the scoriae, and mix with cinder of calx, which you have ruled, and with the faeces which you know, moistening with permanent water. Then look and see whether it has become a powder, but if not, roast in a fire stronger than the first fire, until it be pounded. Then imbue with permanent water, and the more the colours vary all the more suffer them to be heated. Know, moreover, that if you take white quicksilver, or the Spume of Luna, and do as ye are bidden, breaking up with a gentle fire, the same is coagulated, and becomes a stone. Out of this stone, therefore, when it is broken up, many colours will appear to you. But herein, if any ambiguity occur to you in our discourse, do as ye are bidden, ruling the same until a white and coruscating stone shall be produced, and so ye find your purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acsubofen saith:- Master, thou hast spoken without envy, even as became thee, and for the same may God reward thee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras saith:- May God also deliver thee, Acsubofen, from envy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- Ye must know, O Assembly of the Wise, that sulphurs are contained in sulphurs, and humidity in humidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- The envious, O Acsubofen, have uttered something like unto this! Tell us, therefore, what is this humidity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Humidity is a venom, and when venom penetrates a body, it tinges it with an invariable colour, and in no wise permits the soul to be separated from the body, because it is equal thereto. Concerning this, the envious have said: When one flies and the other pursues, then one seizes upon the other, and afterwards they no longer flee, because Nature has laid hold of its equal, after the manner of an enemy, and they destroy one another. For this reason, out of the sulphureous mixed sulphur is produced a most precious colour, which varies not, nor flees from the fire, when the soul enters into the interior of the body and holds the body together and tinges it. I will repeat my words in Tyrian dye. Take the Animal which is called Kenckel, since all its water is a Tyrian colour, and rule the same with a gentle fire, as is customary, until it shall become earth, in which there will be a little colour. But if you wish to obtain the Tyrian tincture, take the humidity which that thing has ejected, and place it therewith gradually in a vessel, adding that tincture whereof the colour was disagreeable to you. Then cook with that same marine water until it shall become dry. Afterwards moisten with that humour, dry gradually, and cease not to imbue it, to cook, and to dry, until it be imbued with all its humour. Then leave it for several days in its own vessel, Until the most precious Tyrian colour shall come out from it to the surface. Observe how I describe the regimen to you! Prepare it with the urine of boys, with water of the sea, and with permanent clean water, so that it may be tinged, and decoct with a gentle fire, until the blackness altogether shall depart from it, and it be easily pounded. Decoct, therefore, in its own humour until it clothe itself with a red colour. But if ye wish to bring it to the Tyrian colour, imbue the same with continual water, and mix, as ye know to be sufficient, according to the rule of sight; mix the same with permanent water sufficiently, and decoct until rust absorb the water. Then wash with the water of the sea which thou hast prepared, which is water of desiccated calx; cook until it imbibe its own moisture; and do this day by day. I tell you that a colour will thence appear to you the like of which the Tyrians have never made. And if ye wish that it should be a still more exalted colour, place the gum in the permanent water, with which ye shall dye it alternately, and afterwards desiccate in the sun. Then restore to the aforesaid water and the black Tyrian colour is intensified. But know that ye do not tinge the purple colour except by cold. Take, therefore, water which is of the nature of cold, and steep wool therein until it extract the force of the tincture from the water. Know also that the Philosophers have called the force which proceeds from that water the Flower. Seek, therefore, your intent in the said water; therein place what is in the vessel for days and nights, until it be clothed with a most precious Tyrian colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frictes saith:- O all ye seekers after Wisdom, know that the foundation of this Art, on account of which many have perished, is one only. There is one thing which is stronger than all natures, and more sublime in the opinion of philosophers, whereas with fools it is more common than anything. But for us it is a thing which we reverence. Woe unto all ye fools! How ignorant are ye of this Art, for which ye would die if ye knew it! I swear to you that if kings were familiar with it, none of us would ever attain this thing. O how this nature changeth body into spirit! O how admirable is Nature, how she presides over all, and overcomes all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras saith:- Name this Nature, O Frictes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- It is a very sharp vinegar, which makes gold into sheer spirit, without which vinegar, neither whiteness, nor blackness, nor redness, nor rust can be made. And know ye that when it is mixed with the body, it is contained therein, and becomes one therewith; it turns the same into a spirit, and tinges with a spiritual and invariable tincture, which is indelible. Know, also, that if ye place the body over the fire without vinegar, it will be burnt and corrupted. And know, further, that the first humour is cold. Be careful, therefore, of the fire, which is inimical to cold. Accordingly, the Wise have said: &amp;quot;Rule gently until the sulphur becomes incombustible.&amp;quot; The Wise men have already shewn to those who possess reason the disposition of this Art, and the best point of their Art, which they mentioned, is, that a little of this sulphur burns a strong body. Accordingly they venerate it and name it in the beginning of their book, and the son of Adam thus described it. For this vinegar burns the body, converts it into a cinder, and also whitens the body, which, if ye cook well and deprive of blackness, is changed into a stone, so that it becomes a coin of most intense whiteness. Cook, therefore, the stone until it be disintegrated, and then dissolve and temper with water of the sea. Know also, that the beginning of the whole work is the whitening, to which succeeds the redness, finally the perfection of the work; but after this, by means of vinegar, and by the will of Gcd, there follows a complete perfection, Now, I have shewn to you, O disciples of this Turba, the disposition of the one thing, which is more perfect, more precious, and more honourable, than all natures, and I swear to you by God that I have searched for a long time in books so that I might arrive at the knowledge of this one thing, while I prayed also to God that he would teach me what it is. My prayer was heard, He shewed me clean water, whereby I knew pure vinegar, and the more I did read books, the more was I illuminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socrates saith:- Know, O crowd of those that still remain of the Sons of the Doctrine, that no tincture can be produced without Lead, which possesses the required virtue. Have ye not seen how thrice-great Hermes infused the red into the body, and it was changed into an invariable colour? Know, therefore, that the first virtue is vinegar, and the second is the Lead of which the Wise have spoken, which if it be infused into all bodies, renders all unchangeable, and tinges them with an invariable colour. Take, therefore, Lead which is made out of the stone called Kuhul; let it be of the best quality, and let it be cooked till it becomes black. Then pound the same with Water of Nitre until it is thick like grease, and cook again in a very bright fire until the spissitude of the body is destroyed, the water being rejected. Kindle, therefore, above it until the stone becomes clean, abounding in precious metal, and exceedingly white. Pound it afterwards with dew and the sun, and with sea and rain water for 31 days, for 10 days with salt water, and 10 days with fresh water, when ye shall find the same like to a metallic stone. Cook the same once more with water of nitre until it become tin by liquefaction. Again cook until it be deprived of moisture, and become dry. But know that when it becomes dry it drinks up what remains of its humour swiftly, because it is burnt lead. Take care, however, lest it be burnt. Thus we call it incombustible sulphur. Pound the same with the sharpest vinegar, and cook till it becomes thick, taking care lest the vinegar be changed into smoke and perish; continue this coction for 150 days. Now, therefore, I have demonstrated the disposition of the white lead, all which afterwards follows being no more than women&#39;s work and child&#39;s play. Know, also, that the arcanum of the work of gold proceeds out of the male and the female, but I have shewn you the male in the lead, while, in like manner, I have discovered for you the female in orpiment. Mix, therefore, the orpiment with the lead, for the female rejoices in receiving the strength of the male, because she is assisted by the male. But the male receives a tingeing spirit from the female. Mix them, therefore, together, place in a glass vessel, and pound with Ethelia and very sharp vinegar; cook for seven days, taking care lest the arcanum smoke away, and leave throughout the night. But if ye wish it to put on mud (colour), seeing that it is already dry, again imbue with vinegar. Now, therefore, I have notified to you the power of orpiment, which is the woman by whom is accomplished the most great arcanum. Do not shew these unto the evil, for they will laugh. It is the Ethelia of vinegar which is placed in the preparation, by which things God perfects the work, whereby also spirits take possession of bodies, and they become spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zimon saith:- O Turba of Philosophers and disciples, now hast thou spoken about making into white, but it yet remains to treat concerning the reddening! Know, all ye seekers after this Art, that unless ye whiten, ye cannot make red, because the two natures are nothing other than red and white. Whiten, therefore, the red, and redden the white! Know, also, that the year is divided into four seasons; the first season is of a frigid complexion, and this is Winter; the second is of the complexion of air, and this is Spring; then follows the third, which is summer, and is of the complexion of fire; lastly, there is the fourth, wherein fruits are matured, which is Autumn. In this manner, therefore, ye are to rule your natures, namely, to dissolve ill winter, to cook in spring, to coagulate in summer, and to gather and tinge the fruit in autumn. Having, therefore, given this example, rule the tingeing natures, but if ye err, blame no one save yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast treated the matter extremely well; add, therefore, another teaching of this kind for the sake of posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I will speak of making lead red. Take the copper which the Master ordered you to take at the beginning of his book, combine lead therewith, and cook it until it becomes thick; congeal also and desiccate until it becomes red. Here certainly is the Red Lead of which the wise spake; copper and lead become a precious stone; mix them equally, let gold be roasted with them, for this, if ye rule well, becomes a tingeing spirit in spirits. So when the male and the female are conjoined there is not produced a volatile wife, but a spiritual composite. From the composite turned into a red spirit is produced the beginning of the world. Behold this is the lead which we have called Red Lead, which is of our work, and without which nothing is effected!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-eighteenth-dictum.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Eighteenth Dictum. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-eighteenth-dictum.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mundus saith to the Turba:- The seekers after this Art must know that the Philosophers in their books have described gum in many ways, but it is none other than permanent water, out of which our precious stone is generated. O how many are the seekers after this gum, and how few there are who find it! Know that this gum is not ameliorated except by gold alone. For there be very many who investigate these applications, and they find certain things, yet they cannot sustain the labours because they are diminished. But the applications which are made out of the gum and out of the honourable stone, which has already held the tincture, they sustain the labours, and are never diminished. Understand, therefore, my words, for I will explain unto you the applications of this gum, and the arcanum existing therein. Know ye that our gum is stronger than gold, and all those who know it do hold it more honourable than gold, yet gold we also honour, for without it the gum cannot be improved. Our gum, therefore, is for Philosophers more precious and more sublime than pearls, because out of gum with a little gold we buy much. Consequently, the Philosophers, when committing these things to writing that the same might not perish, have not set forth in their books the manifest disposition, lest every one should become acquainted therewith, and having become familiar to fools, the same would not sell it at a small price. Take, therefore, one part of the most intense white gum; one part of the urine of a white calf; one part of the gall of a fish; and one part of the body of gum, without which it cannot be improved; mix these portions and cook for forty days. When these things have been done, congeal by the heat of the sun till they are dried. Then cook the same, mixed with milk of ferment, until the milk fail; afterwards extract it, and until it become dry evaporate the moisture by heat. Then mix it with milk of the fig, and cook it till that moisture be dried up in the composite, which afterwards mix with milk of the root of grass, and again cook until it be dry. Then moisten it with rainwater, then sprinkle with water of dew, and cook until it be dried. Also imbue with permanent water, and desiccate until it become of the most intense dryness. Having done these things: mix the same with the gum which is equipped with all manner of colours, and cook strongly until the whole force of the water perish; and the entire body be deprived of its humidity, while ye imbue the same by cooking, until the dryness thereof be kindled. Then dismiss for forty days. Let it remain in that trituration or decocting until the spirit penetrate the body. For by this regimen the spirit is made corporeal, and the body is changed into a spirit. Observe the vessel, therefore, lest the composition fly and pass off in fumes. These things being accomplished, open the vessel, and ye will find that which ye purposed. This, therefore, is the arcanum of gum, which the Philosophers have concealed in their books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dardaris saith:- It is common knowledge that the Masters before us have described Permanent Water. Now, it behoves one who is introduced to this Art to attempt nothing till he is familiar with the power of this Permanent Water, and in commixture, contrition, and the whole regimen, it behoves us to use invariably this famous Permanent Water. He, therefore, who does not understand Permanent Water, and its indispensable regimen, may not enter into this Art, because nothing is effected without the Permanent Water. The force thereof is a spiritual blood, whence the Philosophers have called it Permanent Water, for, having pounded it with the body, as the Masters before me have explained to you, by the will of God it turns that body into spirit. For these, being mixed together and reduced to one, transform each other; the body incorporates the spirit, and the spirit incorporates the body into tinged spirit, like blood. And know ye, that whatsoever hath spirit the same hath blood also as well. Remember, therefore, this arcanum!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belus saith:- O disciples, ye have discoursed excellently!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras answers:- Seeing that they are philosophers, O Belus, why hast thou called them disciples?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth:- It is in honour of their Master, lest I should make them equal with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Pythagoras saith:- Those who, in conjunction with us, have composed this book which is called the Turba, ought not to be termed disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- Master, they have frequently described Permanent Water, and the making of the White and the Red in many ways, albeit under many names; but in the modes after which they have conjoined weights, compositions, and regimens, they agree with the hidden truth. Behold, what is said concerning this despised thing! A report has gone abroad that the Hidden Glory of the Philosophers is a stone and not a stone, and that it is called by many names, lest the foolish should recognise it, Certain wise men have designated it after one fashion, namely, according to the place where it is generated; others have adopted another, founded upon its colour, some of whom have termed it the Green Stone; by other some it is called the Stone of the most intense Spirit of Brass, not to be mixed with bodies; by yet others its description has been further varied, because it is sold for coins by lapidaries who are called saven; some have named it Spume of Luna; some have distinguished it astronomically or arithmetically; it has already received a thousand titles, of which the best is: &amp;quot;That which is produced out of metals.&amp;quot; So also others have called it the Heart of the Sun, and yet others have declared it to be that which is brought forth out of quicksilver with the milk of volatile things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandolfus saith:- O Belus, thou hast said so much concerning the despised stone that thou hast left nothing to be added by thy brethren! Howsoever, I teach posterity that this despised stone is a permanent water, and know, all ye seekers after Wisdom, that permanent water is water of mundane life, because, verily, Philosophers have stated that Nature rejoices in Nature, Nature contains Nature, and Nature overcomes Nature. The Philosophers have constituted this short dictum the principle of the work for reasonable persons. And know ye that no body is more precious or purer than the Sun, and that no tingeing venom: is generated without the Sun and its shadow. He, therefore, who attempts to make the venom of the Philosophers without these, already errs, and has fallen into that pit wherein his sadness remains. But he who has tinged the venom of the wise out of the Sun and its shadow has arrived at the highest Arcanum. Know also that our coin when it becomes red, is called gold; he, therefore, who knows the hidden Cambar of the Philosophers, to him is the Arcanum already revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast even now intelligibly described this stone, yet thou hast not narrated its regimen nor its composition. Return, therefore, to the description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saith:- I direct you to take an occult and honourable arcanum, which is White Magnesia, and the same is mixed and pounded with wine, but take care not to make use of this except it be pure and clean; finally place it in its vessel, and pray God that He may grant you the sight of this very great stone. Then cook gradually, and, extracting, see if it has become a black stone, in which case ye have ruled excellently well. But rule it thus for the white, which is a great arcanum, until it becomes Kuhul, closed up with blackness, which blackness see that it does not remain longer than forty days. Pound the same, therefore, with its confections, which are the said flower of copper, gold of the Indies whose root is one, and a certain extract of an unguent, that is, of a crocus, that is, fixed exalted alum; cook the four, therefore, permanently for 40 or 42 days. After these days God will show you the principle(or beginning) of this stone, which is the stone Atitos, of which favoured sight of God there are many accounts. Cook strongly, and imbue with the gum that remains. And know ye that so often as ye imbue the cinder, so often must it be desiccated and again humectated, until its colour turns into that which ye desire. Now, therefore, will I complete that which I have begun, if God will look kindly on us. Know also that the perfection of the work of this precious stone is to rule it with the residue of the third part of the medicine, and to preserve the two other parts for imbuing and cooking alternately till the required colour appears. Let the fire be more intense than the former; let the matter be cerated, and when it is desiccated it coheres. Cook, therefore, the wax until it imbibes the gluten of gold, which being desiccated, imbue the rest of the work seven times until the other two thirds be finished, and true earth imbibe them all. Finally, place the same on a hot fire until the earth extract its flower and be satisfactory. Blessed are ye if ye understand! But, if not, I will repeat to you the perfection of the work. Take the clean white, which is a most great arcanum, wherein is the true tincture; imbue sand therewith, which sand is made out of the stone seven times imbued, until it drink up the whole, and close the mouth of the vessel effectually, as you have often been told. For that which ye seek of it by the favour of God, will appear to you, which is the stone of Tyrian colour. Now, therefore, I have fulfilled the truth, so do I conjure you by God and your sure Master, that you show not this great arcanum, and beware of the wicked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theophilus saith: Thou hast spoken intelligently and elegantly, and art held free from envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saith the Turba:- Let your discretion, therefore, explain to us what the instructing Pandolfus has stated, and be not envious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- O all ye seekers after this science, the arcanum of gold and the art of the coin is a dark vestment, and no one knows what the Philosophers have narrated in their books without frequent reading, experiments, and questionings of the Wise. For that which they have concealed is more sublime and obscure than it is possible to make known in words, and albeit some have dealt with it intelligibly and well, certain others have treated it obscurely; thus some are more lucid than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth: Thou hast truly spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I announce to posterity that between boritis and copper there is an affinity, because the boritis of the Wise liquefies; the copper, and it changes as a fluxible water. Divide, therefore, the venom into two equal parts, with one of which liquefy the copper, but preserve the other to Pound and imbue the same, until it is drawn out into plates; cook again with the former part of the venom, cook two to seven in two; cook to seven in its own water for 42 days; finally, open the vessel, and ye shall find copper turned into quicksilver; wash the same by cooking until it be deprived of its blackness, and become as copper without a shadow. Lastly, cook it continuously until it be congealed. For when it is congealed it becomes a very great arcanum. Accordingly, the Philosophers have called this stone Boritis; cook, therefore, that coagulated stone until it becomes a matter like mucra. Then imbue it with the Permanent water which I directed you to reserve, that is to say, with the other portion, and cook it many times until its colours manifest. This, therefore, is the very great putrefaction which extracts (or contains in itself) the very great arcanum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saith the Turba:- Return to thine exposition, O Theophilus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- It is to be known that the same affinity which exists between the magnet and iron, also exists assuredly between copper and permanent water. If, therefore, ye rule copper and permanent water as I have directed, there will thence result the very great arcanum in the following fashion. Take white Magnesia and quicksilver, mix with the male, and pound strongly by cooking, not with the hands, until the water become thin. But dividing this water into two parts, in the one part of the water cook it for eleven, otherwise, forty days, until there be a white flower, as the flower of salt in its splendour and coruscation: but strongly close the mouth of the vessel, and cook for forty days, when ye will find it water whiter than milk; deprive it of all blackness by cooking; continue the cooking until its whole nature be disintegrated, until the defilement perish, until it be found clean, and is wholly broken up (or becomes wholly clean). But if ye wish that the whole arcanum, which I have given you, be accomplished, wash the same with water, that is to say, the other part which I counselled you to preserve, until there appear a crocus, and leave in its own vessel. For the Iksir pounds (or contains) itself; imbue also with the residue of the water, until by decoction and by water it be pounded and become like a syrup of pomegranates; imbue it, therefore, and cook, until the weight of the humidity shall fail, and the colour which the Philosophers have magnified shall truly appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cerus saith:- Understand, all ye Sons of the Doctrine, that which Theophilus hath told you, namely, that there exists an affinity between the magnet and the iron, by the alliance of composite existing between the magnet and the iron, while the copper is fitly ruled for one hundred days: what statement can be more useful to you than that there is no affinity between tin and quicksilver!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast ill spoken, having disparaged the true disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I testify that I say nothing but what is true why are you incensed against me Fear the Lord, all ye Turba, that you Master may believe you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Say what you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I direct you to take quicksilver, in which is the male potency or strength; cook the same with its body until it becomes a fluxible water; cook the masculine together with the vapour, until each shall be coagulated and become a stone. Then take the water which you had divided into two parts, of which one is for liquefying and cooking the body, but the second is for cleansing that which is already burnt, and its companion, which [two] are made one. Imbue the stone seven times, and cleanse, until it be disintegrated, and its body be purged from all defilement, and become earth. Know also that in the time of forty-two days the whole is changed into earth; by cooking, therefore, liquefy the same until it become as true water, which is quicksilver. Then wash with water of nitre until it become as a liquefied coin. Then cook until it be congealed and become like to tin, when it is a most great arcanum; that is to say, the stone which is out of two things. Rule the same by cooking and pounding, until it becomes a most excellent crocus. Know also that unto water desiccated with its companion we have given the name of crocus. Cook it, therefore, and imbue with the residual water reserved by you until you attain your purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bocascus saith:- Thou hast spoken well, O Belus, and therefore I follow thy steps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth:- As it may please you, but do not become envious, for that is not the part of the Wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Bocascus:- Thou speakest the truth, and thus, therefore, I direct the Sons of the Doctrine. Take lead, and, as the Philosophers have ordained, imbue, liquefy, and afterwards congeal, until a stone is produced; then rule the stone with gluten of gold and syrup of pomegranates until it be broken up. But you have already divided the water into two parts, with one of which you have liquefied the lead, and it has become as water; cook, therefore, the same until it be dried and have become earth; then pound with the water reserved until it acquire a red colour, as you have been frequently ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast done nothing but pile up ambiguous words. Return, therefore, to the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Ye who wish to coagulate quicksilver, must mix it with its equal. Afterwards cook it diligently until both become permanent water, and, again, cook this water until it be coagulated. But let this be desiccated with its own equal vapour, because ye have found the whole quicksilver to be coagulated by itself. If ye understand, and place in your vessel what is necessary, cook it until it be coagulated, and then pound until it becomes a crocus like to the colour of gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Menabdus saith:- May God reward thee for the regimen, since thou speakest the truth! For thou hast illuminated thy words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- It is said because thou praisest him for his sayings, do not be inferior to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I know that I can utter nothing but that which he hath uttered; however, I counsel posterity to make bodies not bodies, but these incorporeal things bodies. For by this regimen the composite is prepared, and the hidden part of its nature is extracted. With these bodies accordingly join quicksilver and the body of Magnesia, the woman also with the man, and by means of this there is extracted our secret Ethelia, through which bodies are coloured; assuredly, if I understand this regimen, bodies become not bodies, and incorporeal things become bodies. If ye diligently pound the things in the fire and digest (or join to) the Ethelias, they become clean and fixed things. And know ye that quicksilver is a fire burning the bodies, mortifying and breaking up, with one regimen, and the more it is mixed and pounded with the body, the more the body is disintegrated, while the quicksilver is attenuated and becomes living. For when ye shall diligently pound fiery quicksilver and cook it as required, ye will possess Ethel, a fixed nature and colour, subject to every tincture, which also overcomes, breaks, and constrains the fire. For this reason it does not colour things unless it be coloured, and being coloured it colours. And know that no body can tinge itself unless its spirit be extracted from the secret belly thereof, when it becomes a body and soul without the spirit, which is a spiritual tincture, out of which colours have manifested, seeing that a dense thing does not tinge a tenuous, but a tenuous nature colours that which enters into a body. When, however, ye have ruled the body of copper, and have extracted from it a most tenuous (subject), then the latter is changed into a tincture by which it is coloured. Hence has the wise man said, that copper does not tinge unless first it be tinged. And know that those four bodies which you are directed to rule are this copper, and that the tinctures which I have signified unto you are the condensed and the humid, but the condensed is a conjoined vapour, and the humid is the water of sulphur, for sulphurs are contained by sulphurs, and rightly by these things Nature rejoices in Nature, and overcomes, and constrains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twenty-Sixth Dictum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenon saith:- I perceive that you, O crowd of the Wise, have conjoined two bodies, which your Master by no means ordered you to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Inform us according to your own opinion, O Zenon, in this matter, and beware of envy! Then he:- Know that the colours which shall appear to you out of it are these. Know, O Sons of the Doctrine, that it behoves you to allow the composition to putrefy for forty days, and then to sublimate five times in a vessel. Next join to a fire of dung, and cook, when these colours shall appear to you: On the first day black citrine, on the second black red, on the third like unto a dry crocus, finally, the purple colour will appear to you; the ferment and the coin of the vulgar shall be imposed; then is the Ixir composed out of the humid and the dry, and then it tinges with an invariable tincture. Know also that it is called a body wherein there is gold. But when ye are composing the Ixir, beware lest you extract the same hastily, for it lingers. Extract, therefore, the same as an Ixir. For this venom is, as it were, birth and life, because it is a soul extracted out of many things, and imposed upon coins: its tincture, therefore, is life to those things with which it is joined, from which it removes evil, but it is death to the bodies from which it is extracted. Accordingly, the Masters have said that between them there exists the same desire as between male and female, and if any one, being introduced to this Art, should know these natures, he would sustain the tediousness of cooking until he gained his purpose according to the will of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twenty-Seventh Dictum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregorius saith:- O all ye Turba, it is to be observed that the envious have called the venerable stone Efflucidinus, and they have ordered it to be ruled until it coruscates like marble in its splendour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- Show, therefore, what it is to posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- Willingly; you must know that the copper is commingled with vinegar, and ruled until it becomes water. Finally, let it be congealed, and it remains a coruscating stone with a brilliancy like marble, which, when ye see thus, I direct you to rule until it becomes red, because when it is cooked till it is disintegrated and becomes earth, it is turned into a red colour. When ye see it thus, repeatedly cook and imbue it until it assume the aforesaid colour, and it shall become hidden gold. Then repeat the process, when it will become gold of a Tyrian colour. It behoves you, therefore, O all ye investigators of this Art, when ye have observed that this Stone is coruscating, to pound and turn it into earth, until it acquires some degree of redness; then take the remainder of the water which the envious ordered you to divide into two parts, and ye shall imbibe them several times until the colours which are hidden by no body appear unto you. Know also that if ye rule it ignorantly, ye shall see nothing of those colours. I knew a certain person who commenced this work, and operated the natures of truth, who, when the redness was somewhat slow in appearing, imagined that he had made a mistake, and so relinquished the work. Observe, therefore, how ye make the conjunction, for the punic dye, having embraced his spouse, passes swiftly into her body, liquefies, congeals, breaks up, and disintegrates the same. Finally, the redness does not delay in coming, and if ye effect it without the weight, death will take place, whereupon it will be thought to be bad. Hence, I order that the fire should be gentle in liquefaction, but when it is turned to earth make the same intense, and imbue it until God shall extract the colours for us and they appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custos saith:- I am surprised, O all ye Turba! at the very great force and nature of this water, for when it has entered into the said body, it turns it first into earth, and next into powder, to test the perfection of which take in the hand, and if ye find it impalpable as water, it is then most excellent; otherwise, repeat the cooking until it is brought to the required condition. And know that if ye use any substance other than our copper, and rule with our water, it will profit you nothing. If, on the other hand, ye rule our copper with our water, ye shall find all that has been promised by us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Turba answereth:- Father, the envious created no little obscurity when they commanded us to take lead and white quicksilver, and to rule the same with dew and the sun till it becomes a coin-like stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- They meant our copper and our permanent water, when they thus directed you to cook in a gentle fire, and affirmed that there should be produced the said coin-like stone, concerning which the Wise have also observed, that Nature rejoices in Nature, by reason of the affinity which they know to exist between the two bodies, that is to say, copper and permanent water. Therefore, the nature of these two is one, for between them there is a mixed affinity, without which they would not so swiftly unite, and be held together so that they may become one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saith the Turba:- Why do the envious direct us to take the copper which we have now made, and roasted until it has become gold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diamedes saith:- Thou hast spoken already, O Moses [Custos], in an ungrudging manner, as became thee; I will also confirm thy words, passing over the hardness of the elements which the wise desire to remove, this disposition being most precious in their eyes. Know, O ye seekers after this doctrine, that man does not proceed except from a man; that only which is like unto themselves is begotten from brute animals; and so also with flying creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have treated these matters in compendious fashion, exalting you towards the truth, who yourselves omit prolixity, for Nature is truly not improved by Nature, save with her own nature, seeing that thou thyself art not improved except in thy son, that is to say, man in man. See, therefore, that ye do not neglect the precepts concerning her, but make use of venerable Nature, for out of her Art cometh, and out of no other. Know also that unless you seize hold of this Nature and rule it, ye will obtain nothing. Join, therefore, that male, who is son to the red slave, in marriage with his fragrant wife, which having been done, Art is produced between them; add no foreign matter unto these things, neither powder nor anything else; that conception is sufficient for us, for it is near, yet the son is nearer still. How exceeding precious is the nature of that red slave, without which the regimen cannot endure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacsen saith:- O Diomedes, thou hast publicly revealed this disposition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth:- I will even shed more light upon it. Woe unto you who fear not God, for He may deprive you of this art! Why, therefore, are you envious towards your brethren?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They answer:- We do not flee except from fools; tell us, therefore, what is thy will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Place Citrine with his wife after the conjunction into the bath; do not kindle the bath excessively, lest they be deprived of sense and motion; cause them to remain in the bath until their body, and the colour thereof, shall become a certain unity, whereupon restore unto it the sweat thereof; again suffer it to die; then give it rest, and beware lest ye evaporate them by burning them in too strong a fire. Venerate the king and his wife, and do not burn them, since you know not when you may have need of these things, which improve the king and his wife. Cook them, therefore, until they become black, then white, afterwards red, and finally until a tingeing venom is produced. O seekers after this Science, happy are ye, if ye understand, but if not, I have still performed my duty, and that briefly, so that if ye, remain ignorant, it is God who hath concealed the truth from you! Blame not, therefore, the Wise, but yourselves, for if God knew that ye possessed a faithful mind, most certainly he would reveal unto you the truth. Behold, I have established you therein, and have extricated you from error!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacsen saith:- Thou hast spoken well, O Diomedes, but I do not see that thou hast demonstrated the disposition of Corsufle to posterity! Of this same Corsufle the envious have spoken in many ways, and have confused it with all manner of names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- Tell me, therefore, O Bacsen, according to thy opinion in these matters, and I swear by thy father that this is the head of the work, for the true beginning hereof cometh after the completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacsen saith:- I give notice, therefore, to future seekers after this Art, that Corsufle is a composite, and that it must be roasted seven times, because when it arrives at perfection it tinges the whole body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast spoken the truth, O Bacsen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras Saith:- How does the discourse of Bacsen appear to you, since he has omitted to name the substance by its artificial names?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- Name it, therefore, oh Pythagoras!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Corsufle being its composition, they have applied to it all the names of bodies in the world, as, for example, those of coin, copper, tin, gold, iron, and also the name of lead, until it be deprived of that colour and become Ixir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast spoken well, O Pythagoras!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Ye have also spoken well, and some among the others may discourse concerning the residual matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonellus saith: According to thee, O Pythagoras, all things die and live by the will of God, because that nature from which the humidity is removed, that nature which is left by nights, does indeed seem like unto something that is dead; it is then turned and (again) left for certain nights, as a man is left in his tomb, when it becomes a powder. These things being done, God will restore unto it both the soul and the spirit thereof, and the weakness being taken away, that matter will be made strong, and after corruption will be improved, even as a man becomes stronger after resurrection and younger than he was in this world. Therefore it behoves you, O ye Sons of the Doctrine, to consume that matter with fire boldly until it shall become a cinder, when know that ye have mixed it excellently well, for that cinder receives the spirit, and is imbued with the humour until it assumes a fairer colour than it previously possessed. Consider, therefore, O ye Sons of the Doctrine, that artists are unable to paint with their own tinctures until they convert them into a powder; similarly, the philosophers cannot combine medicines for the sick slaves until they also turn them into powder, cooking some of them to a cinder, while others they grind with their hands. The case is the same with those who compose the images of the ancients. But if ye understand what has already been said, ye will know that I speak the truth, and hence I have ordered you to burn up the body and turn it into a cinder, for if ye rule it subtly many things will proceed from it, even as much proceeds from the smallest things in the world. It is thus because copper like man, has a body and a soul, for the inspiration of men cometh from the air, which after God is their life, and similarly the copper is inspired by the humour from which that same copper receiving strength is multiplied and augmented like other things. Hence, the philosophers add, that when copper is consumed with fire and iterated several times, it becomes better than it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Show, therefore, O Bonellus, to future generations after what manner it becometh better than it was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I will do so willingly; it is because it is augmented and multiplied, and because God extracts many things out of one thing, since He hath created nothing which wants its own regimen, and those qualities by which its healing must be effected. Similarly, our copper, when it is first cooked, becomes water; then the more it is cooked, the more is it thickened until it becomes a stone, as the envious have termed it, but it is really an egg tending to become a metal. It is afterwards broken and imbued, when ye must roast it in a fire more intense than the former, until it shall be coloured and shall become like blood in combustion, when it is placed on coins and changes them into gold, according to the Divine pleasure. Do you not see that sperm is not produced from the blood unless it be diligently cooked in the liver till it has acquired an intense red colour, after which no change takes place in that sperm? It is the same with our work, for unless it be cooked diligently until it shall become a powder, and afterwards be putrefied until it shall become a spiritual sperm, there will in no wise proceed from it that colour which ye desire. But if ye arrive at the conclusion of this regimen, and so obtain your purpose, ye shall be princes among the People of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicarus saith:- Now ye have made this arcanum public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thus did the Master order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Not the whole, nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they:- He ordered us to clear away the darkness therefrom; do thou, therefore, tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I counsel posterity to take the gold which they wish to multiply and renovate, then to divide the water into two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- Distinguish, therefore, when they divide the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he:- It behoves them to burn up our copper with one part. For the said copper, dissolved in that water, is called the ferment of Gold, if ye rule well. For the same in like manner are cooked and liquefy as water; finally, by cooking they are congealed, crumble, and the red appears. But then it behoves you to imbue seven times with the residual water, until they absorb all the water, and, all the moisture being dried up, they are turned into dry earth; then kindle a fire and place therein for forty days until the whole shall putrefy, and its colours appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacsen saith:- On account of thy dicta the Philosophers said beware. Take the regal Corsufle, which is like to the redness of copper, and pound in the urine of a calf until the nature of the Corsufle is converted, for the true nature has been hidden in the belly of the Corsufle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba saith:- Explain to posterity what the nature is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- A tingeing spirit which it hath from permanent water, which is coin-like, and coruscates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- Shew, therefore, how it is extracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- It is pounded, and water is poured upon it seven times until it absorbs the whole humour, and receives a force which is equal to the hostility of the fire; then it is called rust. Putrefy the same diligently until it becomes a spiritual powder, of a colour like burnt blood, which the fire overcoming hath introduced into the receptive belly of Nature, and hath coloured with an indelible colour. This, therefore, have kings sought, but not found, save only to whom God has granted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Turba saith:- Finish your speech, O Bacsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I direct them to whiten copper with white water, by which also they make red. Be careful not to introduce any foreign matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Turba:- Well hast thou spoken, O Bacsen, and Nictimerus also has spoken well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- If I have spoken well, do one of you continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Zimon saith:- Hast thou left anything to be said by another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Turba:- Since the words of Nicarus and Bacsen are of little good to those who seek after this Art, tell us, therefore, what thou knowest, according as we have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Ye speak the truth, O all ye seekers after this Art! Nothing else has led you into error but the sayings of the envious, because what ye seek is sold at the smallest possible price. If men knew this, and how great was the thing they held in their hands, they would in no wise sell it. Therefore, the Philosophers have glorified that venom, have treated of it variously, and in many ways, have taken and applied to it all manner of names, wherefore, certain envious persons have said: It is a stone and not a stone, but a gum of Ascotia, consequently, the Philosophers have concealed the power thereof. For this spirit which ye seek, that ye may tinge therewith, is concealed in the body, and hidden away from sight, even as the soul in the human body. But ye seekers after the Art, unless ye disintegrate this body, imbue and pound both cautiously and diligently, until ye extract it from its grossness (or grease), and turn it into a tenuous and impalpable spirit, have your labour in vain. Wherefore the Philosophers have said: Except ye turn bodies into not bodies, and incorporeal things into bodies, ye have not yet discovered the rule of operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Turba saith:- Tell, therefore, posterity how bodies are turned into not-bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- They are pounded with fire and Ethelia till they become a powder. And know that this does not take place except by an exceedingly strong decoction, and continuous contrition, performed with a moderate fire, not with hands, with imbibition and putrefaction, with exposure to the sun and to Ethelia. The envious caused the vulgar to err in this Art when they stated that the thing is common in its nature and is sold at a small price. They further said that the nature was more precious than all natures, wherefore they deceived those who had recourse to their books. At the same time they spoke the truth, and therefore doubt not these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Turba answereth:- Seeing that thou believest the sayings of the envious, explain, therefore, to posterity the disposition of the two natures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I testify to you that Art requires two natures, for the precious is not produced without the common, nor the common without the precious. It behoves you, therefore, O all ye Investigators of this Art, to follow the sayings of Victimerus, when he said to his disciples: Nothing else helps you save to sublimate water and vapour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Turba:- The whole work is in the vapour and the sublimation of water. Demonstrate, therefore, to them the disposition of the vapour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- When ye shall perceive that the natures have become water by reason of the heat of the fire, and that they have been purified, and that the whole body of Magnesia is liquefied as water; then all things have been made vapour, and rightly, for then the vapour contains its own equal, wherefore the envious call either vapour, because both are joined in decoctions, and one contains the other. Thus our stag finds no path to escape, although flight be essential to it. The one keeps back the other, so that it has no opportunity to fly, and it finds no place to escape; hence all are made permanent, for when the one falls, being hidden in the body, it is congealed with it, and its colour varies, and it extracts its nature from the properties which God has infused into His elect, and it alienates it, lest it flee. But the blackness and redness appear, and it falls into sickness, and dies by rust and putrefaction; properly speaking, then, it has not a flight, although it is desirous to escape servitude; then when it is free it follows its spouse, that a favourable colour may befall itself and its spouse; its beauty is not as it was, but when it is placed with coins, it makes them gold. For this reason, therefore, the Philosophers have called the spirit and the soul vapour. They have also called it the black humid wanting perlution; and forasmuch as in man there are both humidity and dryness, thus our work, which the envious have concealed, is nothing else but vapour and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Demonstrate vapour and water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I say that the work is out of two; the envious have called it composed out of two, because these two become four, wherein are dryness and humidity, spirit and vapour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast spoken excellently, and without envy. Let Zimon next follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-thirty-sixth-dictum.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Thirty-Sixth Dictum. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-thirty-sixth-dictum.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afflontus, the Philosopher, saith:- I notify to you all, O ye investigators of this Art, that unless ye sublime the substances at the commencement by cooking, without contrition of hands, until the whole become water, ye have not yet found the work. And know ye, that the copper was formerly called sand, but by others stone, and, indeed, the names vary in every regimen. Know further, that the nature and humidity become water, then a stone, if ye cause them to be well complexionated, and if ye are acquainted with the natures, because the part which is light and spiritual rises to the top, but that which is thick and heavy remains below in the vessel. Now this is the contrition of the Philosophers, namely, that which is not sublimated sinks down, but that which becomes a spiritual powder rises to the top of the vessel, and this is the contrition of decoction, not of hands. Know also, that unless ye have turned all into powder, ye have not yet pounded them completely. Cook them, therefore, successively until they become converted, and a powder. Wherefore Agadaimon saith:- Cook the copper until it become a gentle and impalpable body, and impose in its own vessel; then sublimate the same six or seven times until the water shall descend. And know that when the water has become powder then has it been ground diligently. But if ye ask, how is the water made a powder? note that the intention of the Philosophers is that the body before which before it falls into the water is not water may become water; the said water is mixed with the other water, and they become one water. It is to be stated, therefore, that unless ye turn the thing mentioned into water, ye shall not attain to the work. It is, therefore, necessary for the body to be so possessed by the flame of the fire that it is disintegrated and becomes weak with the water, when the water has been added to the water, until the whole becomes water. But fools, hearing of water, think that this is water of the clouds. Had they read our books they would know that it is permanent water, which cannot become permanent without its companion, wherewith it is made one. But this is the water which the Philosophers have called Water of Gold, the Igneous, Good Venom, and that Sand of Many Names which Hermes ordered to be washed frequently, so that the blackness of the Sun might be removed, which he introduced in the solution of the body. And know, all ye seekers after this Art, that unless ye take this pure body, that is, our copper without the spirit, ye will by no means see what ye desire, because no foreign thing enters therein, nor does anything enter unless it be pure. Therefore, all ye seekers after this Art, dismiss the multitude of obscure names, for the nature is one water; if anyone err, he draws nigh to destruction, and loses his life. Therefore, keep this one nature, but dismiss what is foreign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonellus saith:- I will speak a little concerning Magnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- O all ye Sons of the Doctrine, when mixing Magnesia, place it in its vessel, the mouth of which close carefully, and cook with a gentle fire until it liquefy, and all become water therein! For the heat of the water acting thereupon, it becomes water by the will of God. When ye see that the said water is about to become black, ye know that the body is already liquefied. Place again in its vessel, and cook for forty days, until it drink up the moisture of the vinegar and honey. But certain persons uncover it, say, once in each week, or once in every ten nights; in either case, the ultimate perfection of pure water appears at the end of forty days, for then it completely absorbs the humour of the decoction. Therefore, wash the same, and deprive of its blackness, until, the blackness being removed, the stone becomes dry to the touch. Hence the envious have said:- Wash the Magnesia with soft water, and cook diligently, until it become earth, and the humour perish. Then it is called copper. Subsequently, pour very sharp vinegar upon it, and leave it to be soaked therein. But this is our copper, which the Philosophers have ordained should be washed with permanent water, wherefore they have said: Let the venom be divided into two parts, with one of which burn up the body, and with the other putrefy. And know, all ye seekers after this Science, that the whole work and regimen does not take place except by water, wherefore, they say that the thing which ye seek is one, and, unless that which improves it be present in the said thing, what ye look for shall in no wise take place. Therefore, it behoves you to add those .things which are needful, that ye may thereby obtain that which you purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou has spoken excellently, O Bonellus! If it please thee, therefore, finish that which thou art saying; otherwise repeat it a second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he:- Shall I indeed repeat these and like things? O all ye investigators of this Art, take our copper; place with the first part of the water in the vessel; cook for forty days; purify from all uncleanliness; cook further until its days be accomplished, and it become a stone having no moisture. Then cook until nothing remains except faeces. This done, cleanse seven times, wash with water, and when the water is used up leave it to putrefy in its vessel, so long as may seem desirable to your purpose. But the envious called this composition when it is turned into blackness that which is sufficiently black, and have said: Rule the same with vinegar and nitre. But that which remained when it had been whitened they called sufficiently white, and ordained that it should be ruled with permanent water. Again, when they called the same sufficiently red, they ordained that it should be ruled with water and fire until it became red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Show forth unto posterity what they intended by these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- They called it Ixir satis, by reason of the variation of its colours. In the work, however, there is neither variety, multiplicity, nor opposition of substances; it is necessary only to make the black copper white and then red. However, the truth-speaking Philosophers had no other intention than that of liquefying, pounding, and cooking Ixir until the stone should become like unto marble in its splendour. Accordingly, the envious again said: Cook the same with vapour until the stone becomes coruscating by reason of its brilliancy. But when ye see it thus, it is, indeed, the most great Arcanum. Notwithstanding, ye must then pound and wash it seven times with permanent water; finally, again pound and congeal in its own water, until ye extract its own concealed nature. Wherefore, saith Maria, sulphurs are contained in sulphurs, but humour in like humour, and out of sulphur mixed with sulphur, there comes forth a great work. But I ordain that you rule the same with dew and the sun, until your purpose appear to you. For I signify unto you that there are two kinds of whitening and of making red, of which one consists in rust and the other in contrition and decoction. But ye do not need any contrition of hands. Beware, however, of making a separation from the waters lest the poisons get at You, and the body perish with the other things which are in the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effistus saith:- Thou hast spoken most excellently, O Bonellus, and I bear witness to all thy words!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba saith:- Tell us if there be any service in the speech of Bonellus, so that those initiated in this disposition may be more bold and certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effistus saith:- Consider, all ye investigators of this Art, how Hermes, chief of the Philosophers, spoke and demonstrated when he wished to mix the natures. Take, he tells us, the stone of gold, combine with humour which is permanent water, set in its vessel, over a gentle fire until liquefaction takes place. Then leave it until the water dries, and the sand and water are combined, one with another; then let the fire be more intense than before, until it again becomes dry, and is made earth. When this is done, understand that here is the beginning of the arcanum; but do this many times, until two-thirds of the water perish, and colours manifest unto you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast spoken excellently, O Effistus! Yet, briefly inform us further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I testify to Posterity that the dealbation doth not take place save by decoction. Consequently, Agadaimon has very properly treated of cooking, of pounding, and of imbuing, ethelia. Yet I direct you not to pour on the whole of the water at one time, lest the Ixir be submerged, but pour it in gradually, pound and dessicate, and do this several times until the water be exhausted. Now concerning this the envious have said: Leave the water when it has all been poured in, and it will sink to the bottom. But their intention is this, that while the humour is drying, and when it has been turned into powder, leave it in its glass vessel for forty days, until it passes through various colours, which the Philosophers have described. By this method of cooking the bodies put on their spirits and spiritual tinctures, and become warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast given light to us, O Effistus, and hast done excellently! Truly art thou cleared from envy; wherefore, let one of you others speak as he pleases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacsen saith:- O all ye seekers after this Art, ye can reach no useful result without a patient, laborious, and solicitous soul, persevering courage, and continuous regimen. He, therefore, who is willing to Persevere in this disposition, and would enjoy the result, may enter upon it, but he who desires to learn over speedily, must not have recourse to our books, for they impose great labour before they are read in their higher sense, once, twice, or thrice. Therefore, the Master saith:- Whosoever bends his back over the study of our books, devoting his leisure thereto, is not occupied with vain thoughts, but fears God, and shall reign in the Kingdom without fail until he die. For what ye seek is not of small price. Woe unto you who seek the very great and compensating treasure of God! Know ye not that for the smallest Purpose in the world, earthly men will give themselves to death, and what, therefore, ought they to do for this most excellent and almost impossible offering? Now, the regimen is greater than is perceived by reason, except through divine inspiration. I once met with a person who was as well acquainted with the elements as I myself, but when he proceeded to rule this disposition, he attained not to the joy thereof by reason of his sadness and ignorance in ruling, and excessive eagerness, desire, and haste concerning the purpose. Woe unto you, sons of the Doctrine! For one who plants trees does not look for fruit, save in due season; he also who sows seeds does not expect to reap, except at harvest time. How, then, should ye desire to attain this offering when ye have read but a single book, or have adventured only the first regimen? But the Philosophers have plainly stated that the truth is not to be discerned except after error, and nothing creates greater pain at heart than error in this Art, while each imagines that he has almost the whole world, and yet finds nothing in his hands. Woe unto you! Understand the dictum of the Philosopher, and how he divided the work when he said- pound, cook, reiterate, and be thou not weary. But when thus he divided the work, he signified commingling, cooking, assimilating, roasting, heating, whitening, pounding, cooking Ethelia, making rust or redness, and tingeing. Here, therefore, are there many names, and yet there is one regimen. And if men knew that one decoction and one contrition would suffice them, they would not so often repeat their words, as they have done, and in order that the mixed body may be pounded and cooked diligently, have admonished you not to be weary thereof. Having darkened the matter to you with their words, it suffices me to speak in this manner. It is needful to complexionate the venom rightly, then cook many times, and do not grow tired of the decoction. Imbue and cook it until it shall become as I have ordained that it should be ruled by you- namely, impalpable spirits, and until ye perceive that the Ixir is clad in the garment of the Kingdom. For when ye behold the Ixir turned into Tyrian colour, then have ye found that which the Philosophers discovered before you. If ye understand my words (and although my words be dead, yet is there life therein for those who understand themselves), they will forthwith explain any ambiguity occurring herein. Read, therefore, repeatedly, for reading is a dead speech, but that which is uttered with the lips the same is living speech. Hence we have ordered you to read frequently, and, moreover, ponder diligently over the things which we have narrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he:- Do thou, therefore, Jargus, in thy clemency shew forth the same!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he answereth:- The copper of which thou hast before spoken is not copper, nor is it the tin of the vulgar; it is our true work (or body) which must be combined with the body of Magnesia, that it may be cooked and pounded without wearying until the stone is made. Afterwards, that stone must be pounded in its vessel with the water of nitre, and, subsequently, placed in liquefaction until it is destroyed. But, all ye investigators of this art, it is necessary to have a water by which the more you cook, so much the more you sprinkle, until the said copper shall put on rust, which is the foundation of our work. Cook, therefore, and pound with Egyptian vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zimon saith:- I notify to Posterity that the rotundum turns into four elements, and is derived out of one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Inasmuch as thou art speaking, explain for future generations the method of ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Willingly: it is necessary to take one part of our copper, but of Permanent Water three parts; then let them be mixed and cooked until they be thickened and become one stone, concerning which the envious have said: Take one part of the pure body, but three parts of copper of Magnesia; then commingle with rectified vinegar, mixed with male of earth; close the vessel, observe what is in it, and cook continuously until it becomes earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ascanius saith:- Too much talking, O all ye Sons of the Doctrine, leads this subject further into error! But when ye read in the books of the Philosophers that Nature is one only, and that she overcomes all things: Know that they are one thing and one composite. Do ye not see that the complexion of a man is formed out of a soul and body; thus, also, must ye conjoin these, because the Philosophers, when they prepared the matters and conjoined spouses mutually in love with each other, behold there ascended from them a golden water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- When thou wast treating of the first work, lo! thou didst turn unto the second! How ambiguous hast thou made thy book, and how obscure are thy words!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- I will perform the disposition of the first work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Stir up war between copper and quicksilver, until they go to destruction and are corrupted, because when the copper conceives the quicksilver it coagulates it, but when the quicksilver conceives the copper, the copper is congealed into earth; stir up, therefore, a fight between them; destroy the body of the copper until it becomes a powder. But conjoin the male to the female, which are vapour and quicksilver, until the male and the female become Ethel, for he who changes them into spirit by means of Ethel, and next makes them red, tinges every body, because, when by diligent cooking ye pound the body, ye extract a pure, spiritual, and sublime soul therefrom, which tinges every body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Inform, therefore, posterity what is that body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- It is a natural sulphureous thing which is called by the names of all bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dardaris saith:- Ye have frequently treated of the regimen, and have introduced the conjunction, yet I proclaim to posterity that they cannot extract the now hidden soul except by Ethelia, by which bodies become not bodies through continual cooking, and by sublimation of Ethelia. Know also that quicksilver is fiery, burning every body more than does fire, also mortifying bodies, and that every body which is mingled with it is ground and delivered over to be destroyed. When, therefore, ye have diligently pounded the bodies, and have exalted them as required, therefrom is produced that Ethel nature, and a colour which is tingeing and not volatile, and it tinges the copper which the Turba said did not tinge until it is tinged, because that which is tinged tinges. Know also that the body of the copper is ruled by Magnesia, and that quicksilver is four bodies, also that the matter has no being except by humidity, because it is the water of sulphur, for sulphurs are contained in sulphurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba saith:- O Dardaris, inform posterity what sulphurs are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Sulphurs are souls which are hidden in four bodies, and, extracted by themselves, do contain one another, and are naturally conjoined. For if ye rule that which is hidden in the belly of sulphur with water, and cleanse well that which is hidden, then nature rejoices, meeting with nature, and water similarly with its equal. Know ye also that the four bodies are not tinged but tinge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Turba:- Why dost thou not say like the ancients that when they are tinged, they tinge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I state that the four coins of the vulgar populace are not tinged, but they tinge copper, and when that copper is tinged, it tinges the coins of the populace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moyses saith:- This one thing of which thou hast told us, O Dardaris, the Philosophers have called by many names, sometimes by two and sometimes by three names!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dardaris answereth:- Name it, therefore, for posterity, setting aside envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- The one is that which is fiery, the two is the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;body composed in it, the three is the water of sulphur, with which also it is washed and ruled until it be perfected. Do ye not see what the Philosopher affirms, that the quicksilver which tinges gold is quicksilver out of Cambar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dardaris answereth:- What dost thou mean by this? For the Philosopher says: sometimes from Cambar and sometimes from Orpiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Quicksilver of orpiment is Cambar of Magnesia, but quicksilver is sulphur ascending from the mixed composite. Ye must, therefore, mix that thick thing with fiery venom, putrefy, and diligently pound until a spirit be produced, which is hidden in that other spirit; then is made the tincture which is desired of you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Plato saith: It behoves you all, O Masters, when those bodies are being dissolved, to take care lest they be burnt up, as also to wash them with sea water, until all their salt be turned into sweetness, clarifies, tinges, becomes tincture of copper, and then goes off in flight! Because it was necessary that one should become tingeing, and that the other should be tinged, for the spirit being separated from the body and hidden in the other spirit, both become volatile. Therefore the Wise have said that the gate of flight must not be opened for that which would flee, (or that which does not flee), by whose flight death is occasioned, for by the conversion of the sulphureous thing into a spirit like unto itself, either becomes volatile, since they are made aeriform spirits prone to ascend in the air. But the Philosophers seeing that which was not volatile made volatile with the volatiles, iterated these to a body like to the non-volatiles, and put them into that from which they could not escape. They iterated them to a body like unto the bodies from which they were extracted, and the same were then digested. But as for the statement of the Philosopher that the tingeing agent and that which is to be tinged are made one tincture, it refers to a spirit concealed in another humid spirit. Know also that one of the humid spirits is cold, but the other is hot, and although the cold humid is not adapted to the warm humid, nevertheless they are made one. Therefore, we prefer these two bodies, because by them we rule the whole work, namely, bodies by not-bodies, until incorporeals become bodies, steadfast in the fire, because they are conjoined with volatiles, which is not possible in any body, these excepted. For spirits in every wise avoid bodies, but fugitives are restrained by incorporeals. Incorporeals, therefore, similarly flee from bodies; those, consequently, which do not flee are better and more precious than all bodies. These things, therefore, being done, take those which are not volatile and join them; wash the body with the incorporeal until the incorporeal receives a non-volatile body; convert the earth into water, water into fire, fire into air, and conceal the fire in the depths of the water, but the earth in the belly of the air, mingling the hot with the humid, and the cold with the dry. Know, also, that Nature overcomes Nature, Nature rejoices in Nature, Nature contains Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attamus saith:- It is to be noted that the whole assembly of the Philosophers have frequently treated concerning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubigo. Rubigo, however, is a fictitious and not a true name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Name, therefore, Rubigo by its true name, for by this it is not calumniated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Rubigo is according to the work, because it is from gold alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Why, then, have the Philosophers referred it to the leech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answereth:- Because water is hidden in sulphureous gold as the leech is in water; rubigo, therefore, is rubefaction in the second work, but to make rubigo is to whiten in the former work, in which the Philosophers ordained that the flower of gold should be taken and a proportion of gold equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mundus saith:- Thou hast already treated sufficiently of Rubigo, O Attamus! I will speak, therefore, of venom, and will instruct future generations that venom is not a body, because subtle spirits have made it into a tenuous spirit, have tinged the body and burned it with venom, which venom the Philosopher asserts will tinge every body. But the Ancient Philosophers thought that he who turned gold into venom had arrived at the purpose, but he who can do not this profiteth nothing. Now I say unto you, all ye Sons of the Doctrine, that unless ye reduce the thing by fire until those things ascend like a spirit, ye effect nought. This, therefore, is a spirit avoiding the fire and a ponderous smoke, which when it enters the body penetrates it entirely, and makes the body rejoice. The Philosophers have all said: Take a black and conjoining spirit; therewith break up the bodies and torture them till they be altered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras saith:- We must affirm unto all you seekers after this Art that the Philosophers have treated of conjunction (or continuation) in various ways. But I enjoin upon you to make quicksilver con strain the body of Magnesia, or the body Kuhul, or the Spume of Luna, or incombustible sulphur, or roasted calx, or alum which is out of apples, as ye know. But if there was any singular regimen for any of these, a Philosopher would not say so, as ye know. Understand, therefore, that sulphur, calx, and alum which is from apples, and Kuhul, are all nothing else but water of sulphur. Know ye also that Magnesia, being mixed with quicksilver and sulphur, they pursue one another. Hence you must not dismiss that Magnesia without the quicksilver, for when it is composed it is called an exceeding strong composition, which is one of the ten regimens established by the Philosophers. Know, also, that when Magnesia is whitened with quicksilver, you must congeal white water therein, but when it is reddened you must congeal red water, for, as the Philosophers have observed in their books, the regimen is not one. Accordingly, the first congelation is of tin, copper, and lead. But the second is composed with water of sulphur. Some, however, reading this book, think that the composition can be bought. It must be known for certain that nothing of the work can be bought, and that the science of this Art is nothing else than vapour and the sublimation of water, with the conjunction, also, of quicksilver in the body of Magnesia; but, heretofore, the Philosophers have demonstrated in their books that the impure water of sulphur is from sulphur only, and no sulphur is produced without the water of its calx, and of quicksilver, and of sulphur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belus saith:- O all ye Philosophers, ye have not dealt sparingly concerning composition and contact, but cornposition, contact, and congelation are one thing! Take, therefore, a part From the one composition and a part out of ferment of gold, and on these impose pure water of sulphur. This, then, is the potent (or revealed) arcanum which tinges every body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras answereth:- O Belus, why hast thou called it a potent arcanum, yet hast not shown its work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- In our books, O Master, we have found the same which thou hast received from the ancients!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Pythagoras:- Therefore have I assembled you together, that you might remove any obscurities which are in any books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Willingly, O Master! It is to be noted that pure water which is from sulphur is not composed of sulphur alone, but is composed of several things, for the one sulphur is made out of several sulphurs. How, therefore, O Master, shall I compose these things that they may become one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Mix, O Belus, that which strives with the fire with that which does not strive, for things which are conjoined in a fire suitable to the same contend, because the warm venoms of the physician are cooked in a gentle, incomburent fire! Surely ye perceive what the Philosophers have stated concerning decoction, that a little sulphur burns many strong things, and the humour which remains is called humid pitch, balsam of gum, and other like things. Therefore our Philosophers are made like to the physicians, notwithstanding that the tests of the physicians are more intense than those of the Philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- I wish, O Belus, that you would also shew the disposition of this potent arcanum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I proclaim to future generations that this arcanum proceeds from two compositions, that is to say, sulphur and magnesia. But after it is reduced and conjoined into one, the Philosophers have called it water, spume of Boletus (i.e., a species of fungus), and the thickness of gold. When, however, it has been reduced into quicksilver, they call it sulphur of water; sulphur also, when it contains sulphur, they term a fiery venom, because it is a potent (or open) arcanum which ascends from those things ye know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandolphus saith:- If, O Belus, thou dost describe the sublimation of sulphur for future generations, thou wilt accomplish an excellent thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Turba:- Do thou show it forth, therefore, O Pandolphus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- The philosophers have ordered that quicksilver should be taken out of Cambar, and albeit they spoke truly, yet in these words there is a little ambiguity, the obscurity of which I will remove. See then that the quicksilver is sublimed in tabernacles, and extract the same from Cambar, but there is another Cambar in sulphur which Belus hath demonstrated to you, for out of sulphur mixed with sulphur, many works proceed. When the same has been sublimed, there proceeds from the Cambar that quicksilver which is called Ethelia, Orpiment, Zendrio, or Sanderich, Ebsemich, Magnesia, Kuhul, or Chuhul, and many other names. Concerning this, philosophers have said that, being ruled by its regimen (for ten is the perfection of all things), its white nature appears, nor is there any shadow therein. Then the envious have called it lead from Ebmich, Magnesia, Marteck, White Copper. For, when truly whitened, it is devoid of shadow and blackness, it has left its thickened ponderous bodies, and therewith a clean humid spirit has ascended, which spirit is tincture. Accordingly, the wise have said that copper has a soul and a body. Now, its soul is spirit, and its body is thick. Therefore, it behoves you to destroy the thick body until ye extract a tingeing spirit from the same. Mix, also, the spirit extracted therefrom with light sulphur until you, investigators, find your design accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horfolcos saith:- Thou hast narrated nothing, O Pandolphus, save the last regimen of this body! Thou hast, therefore, composed an ambiguous description for readers. But if its regimen were commenced from the beginning, you would destroy this obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saith the Turba:- Speak, therefore, concerning this to posterity, so far as it may please you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- It behoves you, investigators of this Art, first to burn copper in a gentle fire, like that required in the hatching of eggs. For it behoves you to burn it with its humidity lest its spirit be burnt, and let the vessel be closed on all sides, so that its colour [heat] may be increased, the body of copper be destroyed, and its tingeing spirit be extracted, concerning which the envious have said: Take quicksilver out of the Flower of Copper, which also they have called the water of our copper, a fiery venom, and a substance extracted from all things, which further they have termed Ethelia, extracted out of many things. Again, some have said that when all things become one, bodies are made not-bodies, but not-bodies bodies. And know, all ye investigators of this Art, that every body is dissolved with the spirit with which it is mixed, with which without doubt it becomes a similar spiritual thing, and that every spirit which has a tingeing colour of spirits, and is constant against fire, is altered and coloured by bodies. Blessed then be the name of Him who hath inspired the Wise with the idea of turning a body into a spirit having strength and colour, unalterable and incorruptible, so that what formerly was volatile sulphur is now made sulphur not-volatile, and incombustible! Know, also, all ye sons of learning, that he who is able to make your fugitive spirit red by the body mixed with it, and then from that body and that spirit can extract the tenuous nature hidden in the belly thereof, by a most subtle regimen, tinges every body, if only he is patient in spite of the tedium of extracting. Wherefore the envious have said: Know that out of copper, after it is humectated by the moisture thereof, is pounded in its water, and is cooked in sulphur, if ye extract a body having Ethelia, ye will find that which is suitable as a tincture for anything. Therefore the envious have said: Things that are diligently pounded in the fire, with sublimation of the Ethelia, become fixed tinctures. For whatsoever words ye find in any man&#39;s book signify quicksilver, which we call water of sulphur, which also we sometimes say is lead and copper and copulated coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ixumdrus saith:- You will have treated most excellently, O Horfolcus, concerning the regimen of copper and the humid spirit, provided you proceed therewith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Perfect, therefore, what I have omitted, O Ixumdrus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ixumdrus saith:- You must know that this Ethelia which you have previously mentioned and notified, which also the envious have called by many names, doth whiten, and tinge when it is whitened; then truly the Philosophers have called it the Flower of Gold, because it is a certain natural thing. Do you not remember what the Philosophers have said, that before it arrives at this terminus, copper does not tinge? But when it is tinged it tinges, because quicksilver tinges when it is combined with its tincture. But when it is mixed with those ten things which the Philosophers have denominated fermented urines, then have they called all these things Multiplication. But some have termed their mixed bodies Corsufle and Gum of Gold. Therefore, those names which are found in the books of the Philosophers, and are thought superfluous and vain, are true and yet are fictitious, because they are one thing, one opinion, and one way. This is the quicksilver which is indeed extracted from all things, out of which all things are produced, which also is pure water that destroys the shade of copper. And know ye that this quicksilver, when it is whitened, becomes a sulphur which contains sulphur, and is a venom that has a brilliance like marble; this the envious call Ethelia, orpiment and sandarac, out of which a tincture and pure spirit ascends with a mild fire, and the whole pure flower is sublimated, which flower becomes wholly quicksilver. It is, therefore, a most great arcanum which the Philosophers have thus described, because sulphur alone whitens copper. Ye, O investigators of this Art, must know that the said sulphur cannot whiten copper until it is whitened in the work! And know ye also that it is the habit of this sulphur to escape. When, therefore, it flees from its own thick bodies, and is sublimated as a vapour, then it behoves you to retain it otherwise with quicksilver of its own kind, lest it vanish altogether. Wherefore the Philosophers have said, that sulphurs are contained by sulphurs. Know, further, that sulphurs tinge, and then are they certain to escape unless they are united to quicksilver of its own kind. Do not, therefore, think that because it tinges and afterwards escapes, it is the coin of the Vulgar, for what the Philosophers are seeking is the coin of the Philosophers, which, unless it be mixed with white or red, which is quicksilver of its own kind, would doubtless escape. I direct you, therefore, to mix quicksilver with quicksilver (of its kind) until together they become one clean water composed out of two. This is, therefore, the great arcanum, the confection of which is with its own gum; it is cooked with flowers in a gentle fire and with earth; it is made red with mucra and with vinegar, salt, and nitre, and with mutal is turned into rubigo, or by any of the select tingeing agents existing in our coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exumenus saith:- The envious have laid waste the whole Art with the multiplicity of names, but the entire work must be the Art of the Coin. For the Philosophers have ordered the doctors of this art to make coin-like gold, which also the same Philosophers have called by all manner of names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Inform, therefore, posterity, O Exumenus, concerning a few of these names, that they may take warning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- They have named it salting, sublimating, washing, and pounding Ethelias, whitening in the fire, frequently cooking vapour and coagulating, turning into rubigo, the confection of Ethel, the art of the water of sulphur and coagula. By all these names is that operation called which has pounded and whitened copper. And know ye, that quicksilver is white to the sight, but when it is possessed by the smoke of sulphur, it reddens and becomes Cambar. Therefore, when quicksilver is cooked with its confections it is turned into red, and hence the Philosopher saith that the nature of lead is swiftly converted. Do you not see that the Philosophers have spoken without envy! Hence we deal in many ways with pounding and reiteration, that ye may extract the spirits existing in the vessel, which the fire did not cease to burn continuously. But the water placed with those things prevents the fire from burning, and it befalls those things that the more they are possessed by the flame of fire, the more they are hidden in the depths of the water, lest they should be injured by the heat of the fire; but the water receives them in its belly and repels the flame of fire from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Unless ye make bodies not-bodies ye achieve nothing. But concerning the sublimation of water the Philosophers have treated not a little. And know that unless ye diligently pound the thing in the fire, the Ethelia does not ascend, but when that does not ascend ye achieve nothing. When, however, it ascends it is an instrument for the intended tincture with which ye tinge, and concerning this Ethelia Hermes saith: Sift the things which ye know; but another: Liquefy the things. Therefore, Arras saith: Unless ye pound the thing diligently in the fire, Ethelia does not ascend. The Master hath put forth a view which I shall now explain to the reasoners. Know ye that a very great wind of the south, when it is stirred up, sublimates clouds and elevates the vapours of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Thou hast dealt obscurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I will explain the testa, and the vessel wherein is incombustible sulphur. But I order you to congeal fluxible quicksilver out of many things, that two may be made three, and four one, and two one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anaxagoras saith:- Take the volatile burnt thing which lacks a body, and incorporate it. Then take the ponderous thing, having smoke, and thirsting to imbibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Explain, O Anaxagoras, what is this obscurity which you expound, and beware of being envious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I testify to you that this volatile burnt thing, and this other which thirsts, are Ethelia, which has been conjoined with sulphur. Therefore, place these in a glass vessel over the fire, and cook until the whole becomes Cambar. Then God will accomplish the arcanum ye seek. But I direct you to cook continuously, and not to grow tired of repeating the process. And know ye that the perfection of this work is the confection of water of sulphur with tabula; finally, it is cooked until it becomes Rubigo, for all the Philosophers have said: He who is able to turn Rubigo into golden venom has already achieved the desired work, but otherwise his labour is vain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zenon saith:- Pythagoras hath treated concerning the water, which the envious have called by all names. Finally, at the end of his book he has treated of the ferment of gold, ordaining that thereon should be imposed clean water of sulphur, and a small quantity of its gum. I am astonished, O all ye Turba, how the envious have in this work discoursed of the perfection rather than the commencement of the same!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Why, therefore, have you left it to putrefy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Thou hast spoken truly; putrefaction does not take place without the dry and the humid. But the vulgar putrefy with the humid. Thus the humid is merely coagulated with the dry. But out of both is the beginning of the work. Notwithstanding, the envious have divided this work into three parts, asserting that one quickly flees, but the other is fixed and immovable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constans saith:- What have you to do with the treatises of the envious, for it is necessary that this work should deal with four things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They answer:- Demonstrate, therefore, what are those four?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Earth, water, air, and fire. Ye have then those four elements without which nothing is ever generated, nor is anything absolved in the Art. Mix, therefore, the dry with the humid, which are earth and water, and cook in the fire and in the air, whence the spirit and the soul are dessicated. And know ye that the tenuous tingeing agent takes its power out of the tenuous part of the earth, out of the tenuous part of the fire and of the air, while out of the tenuous part of the water, a tenuous spirit has been dessicated. This, therefore, is the process of our work, namely, that everything may be turned into earth when the tenuous parts of these things are extracted, because a body is then composed which is a kind of atmospheric thing, and thereafter tinges the imposed body of coins. Beware, however, O all ye investigators of this art, lest ye multiply things, for the envious have multiplied and destroyed for you! They have also described various regimens that they might deceive; they have further called it (or have likened it to) the humid with all the humid, and the dry with all the dry, by the name of every stone and metal, gall of animals of the sea, the winged things of heaven and reptiles of the earth. But do ye who would tinge observe that bodies are tinged with bodies. For I say to you what the Philosopher said briefly and truly at the beginning of his book. In the art of gold is the quicksilver from Cambar, and in coins is the quicksilver from the Male. In nothing, however, look beyond this, since the two quicksilvers are also one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acratus saith:- I signify to posterity that I make philosophy near to the Sun and Moon. He, therefore, that will attain to the truth let him take the moisture of the Sun and the Spume of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Why are you made an adversary to your brethren?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I have spoken nothing but the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they:- Take what the Turba hath taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I was so intending, yet, if you are willing, I direct posterity to take a part of the coins which the Philosophers have ordered, which also Hermes has adapted to the true tingeing, and a part of the copper of the Philosophers, to mix the same with the coins, and place all the four bodies in the vessel, the mouth of which must be carefully closed, lest the water escape. Cooking must proceed for seven days, when the copper, already pounded with the coins, is found turned into water. Let both be again slowly cooked, and fear nothing. Then let the vessel be opened, and a blackness will appear above. Repeat the process, cook continually until the blackness of Kuhul, which is from the blackness of coins, be consumed. For when that is consumed a precious whiteness will appear on them; finally, being returned to their place, they are cooked until the whole is dried and is turned into stone. Also repeatedly and continuously cook that stone born of copper and coins with a fire sharper than the former, until the stone is destroyed, broken up, and turned into cinder, which is a precious cinder. Alas, O ye sons of the Doctrine, how precious is that which is produced from it! Mixing, therefore, the cinder with water, cook again, until that cinder liquefy therewith, and then cook and imbue with permanent water, until the composition becomes sweet and mild and red. Imbue until it becomes humid. Cook in a still hotter fire, and carefully close the mouth of the vessel, for by this regimen fugitive bodies become not-fugitive, spirits are turned into bodies, bodies into spirits, and both are connected together. Then are spirits made bodies having a tingeing and germinating soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Now hast thou notified to posterity that Rubigo attaches itself to copper after the blackness is washed off with permanent water. Then it is congealed and becomes a body of Magnesia. Finally, it is cooked until the whole body is broken up. Afterwards the volatile is turned into a cinder and becomes copper without its shadow. Attrition also truly takes place. Concerning, therefore, the work of the Philosophers, what hast thou delivered to posterity, seeing that thou hast by no means called things by their proper names!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Following your own footsteps, I have discoursed even as have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonellus answereth:- You speak truly, for if you did otherwise we should not order your sayings to be written in our books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fifty-eighth-dictum.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Fifty-Eighth Dictum. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fifty-eighth-dictum.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balgus saith:- The whole Turba, O Acratus, has already spoken, as you have seen, but a benefactor sometimes deceives, though his intention is to do good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- Thou speakest truly. Proceed, therefore, according to thy opinion, and beware of envy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- You must know that the envious have described this arcanum in the shade; in physical reasoning and astronomy, and the art of images; they have also likened it to trees; they have ambiguously concealed it by the names of metals, vapours, and reptiles; as is generally perceived in all their work. I, nevertheless, direct you, investigators of this science, to take iron and draw it into plates; finally, mix (or sprinkle) it with venom, and place it in its vessel, the mouth of which must be closed most carefully, and beware lest ye too much increase the humour, or, on the other hand, lest it be too dry, but stir it vigorously as a mass, because, if the water be in excess, it will not be contained in the chimney, while, if it be too dry, it will neither be conjoined nor cooked in the chimney; hence I direct you to confect it diligently; finally, place it in its vessel, the mouth of which must be closed internally and externally with clay, and, having kindled coals above it, after some days ye shall open it, and there shall ye find the iron plates already liquefied; while on the lid of the vessel ye shall find globules. For when the fire is kindled the vinegar ascends, because its spiritual nature passes into the air, wherefore, I direct you to keep that part separately. Ye must also know that by multiplied decoctions and attritions it is congealed and coloured by the fire, and its nature is changed. By a similar decoction and liquefaction Cambar is not disjoined. I notify to you that by the said frequent decoction the weight of a third part of the water is consumed, but the residue becomes a wind in the Cambar of the second spirit. And know ye that nothing is more precious or more excellent than the red sand of the sea, for the Sputum of Luna is united with the light of the Sun&#39;s rays. Luna is perfected by the coming on of night, and by the heat of the Sun the dew is congealed. Then, that being wounded, the dew of the death dealer is joined, and the more the days pass on the more intensely is it congealed, and is not burned. For he who cooks with the Sun is himself congealed, and that signal whiteness causes it to overcome the terrene fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then saith Bonites:- Do you not know, O Balgus, that the Spume of Luna tinges nothing except our copper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Balgus:- Thou speakest truly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Why, therefore, hast thou omitted to describe that tree, of the fruit whereof whosoever eateth shall hunger nevermore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Balgus:- A certain person, who has followed science, has notified to me after what manner he discovered this same tree, and appropriately operating, did extract the fruit and eat of it. But when I inquired of him concerning the growth and the increment, he described that pure whiteness, thinking that the same is found without any laborious disposition. Then its Perfection is the fruit thereof. But when I further asked how it is nourished with food until it fructifies, he said: Take that tree, and build a house about it, which shall wholly surround the same, which shall also be circular, dark, encircled by dew, and shall have placed on it a man of a hundred years; shut and secure the door lest dust or wind should reach them. Then in the time of 180 days send them away to their homes. I say that man shall not cease to eat of the fruit of that tree to the perfection of the number [of the days] until the old man shall become young. O what marvellous natures, which have transformed the soul of that old man into a juvenile body, and the father is made into the son! Blessed be thou, O most excellent God!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theophilus saith:- I propose to speak further concerning those things which Bonites hath narrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Turba:- Speak, Brother, for thy brother hath discoursed elegantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Following in the steps of Bonites I will make perfect his sayings. It should be known that all the Philosophers, while they have concealed this disposition, yet spoke the truth in their treatises when they named water of life, for this reason, that whatsoever is mixed with the said water first dies, then lives and becomes young. And know, all ye disciples, that iron does not become rusty except by reason of this water, because it tinges the plates; it is then placed in the sun till it liquefies and is imbued, after which it is congealed. In these days it becomes rusty, but silence is better than this illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- O Theophilus, beware of becoming envious, and complete thy speech!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Would that I might repeat the like thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- What is thy will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he:- Certain fruits, which proceed first from that perfect tree, do flourish in the beginning of the summer, and the more they are multiplied the more are they adorned, until they are perfected, and being mature become sweet. In the same way that woman, fleeing from her own children, with whom she lives, although partly angry, yet does not brook being overcome, nor that her husband should possess her beauty, who furiously loves her, and keeps awake contending with her, till he shall have carnal intercourse with her, and God make perfect the foetus, when he multiplies children to himself according to his pleasure. His beauty, therefore, is consumed by fire who does not approach his wife except by reason of lust. For when the term is finished he turns to her. I also make known to you that the dragon never dies, but the Philosophers have put to death the woman who slays her spouses. For the belly of that woman is full of weapons and venom. Let, therefore, a sepulchre be dug for the dragon, and let that woman be buried with him, who being strongly joined with that woman, the more he clasps her and is entwined with her, the more his body, by the creation of female weapons in the body of the woman, is cut up into parts. For perceiving him mixed with the limbs of a woman he becomes secure from death, and the whole is turned into blood. But the Philosophers, beholding him turned into blood, leave him in the sun for certain days, until the lenitude is consumed, the blood dries up, and they find that venom which now is manifest. Then the wind is hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonellus saith:- Know, all ye disciples, that out of the elect things nothing becomes useful without conjunction and regimen, because sperma is generated out of blood and desire. For the man mingling with the woman, the sperm is nourished by the humour of the womb, and by the moistening blood, and by heat, and when forty nights have elapsed the sperm is formed. But if the humidity of the blood and of the womb were not heat, the sperm would not be dissolved, nor the foetus be procreated. But God has constituted that heat and blood for the nourishment of the sperm until the foetus is brought forth, after which it is not nourished, save by milk and fire, sparingly and gradually, while it is dust, and the more it burns the more, the bones being strengthened, it is led towards youth, arriving at which it is independent. Thus it behoves you also to act in this Art. Know ye that without heat nothing is ever generated, and that the bath causes the matter to perish by means of intense heat. If, indeed, it be frigid, it puts to flight and disperses, but if it have been tempered, it is convenient and sweet to the body, wherefore the veins become smooth and the flesh is augmented. Behold it has been demonstrated to you, all ye disciples! Understand, therefore, and in all things which ye attempt to rule, fear God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moses saith:- It is to be observed that the envious have named lead of copper instruments of formation, simulating, deceiving posterity, to whom I give notice that there are no instruments except from our own white, strong, and splendid powder, and from our concave stone and marble, to the whole work whereof there is no more suitable powder, nor one more conjoined to our composition, than the powder of Alociae, out of which are produced instruments of formation. Further, the Philosophers have already said: Take instruments out of the egg. Yet they have not said what the egg is, nor of what bird. And know ye that the regimen of these things is more difficult than the entire work, because, if the composition be ruled more than it should be, its light is taken and extinguished by the sea. Wherefore the Philosophers have ordered that it should be ruled with profound judgment. The moon, therefore, being at the full, take this and place in sand till it be dissolved. And know ye that while ye are placing the same in sand and repeating the process, unless ye have patience, ye err in ruling, and corrupt the work. Cook, therefore, the same in a gentle fire until ye see that it is dissolved. Then extinguish with vinegar, and ye shall find one thing separated from three companions. And know ye that the first, Ixir, commingles, the second burns, while the third liquefies. In the first place, therefore, impose nine ounces of vinegar twice - first while the vessel is being made hot, and second when it is heated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mundus saith:- It behoves you, O all ye seekers after this Art, to know that whatsoever the Philosophers have narrated or ordained, Kenckel, herbs, geldum, and carmen, are one thing! Do not, therefore, trouble about a plurality of things, for there is one Tyrian tincture of the Philosophers to which they have given names at will, and having abolished the proper name, they have called it black, because it has been extracted from our sea. And know that the ancient priests did not condescend to wear artificial garments, whence, for purifying altars, and lest they should introduce into them anything sordid or impure, they tinged Kenckel with a Tyrian colour; but our Tyrian colour, which they placed in their altars and treasuries, was more clean and fragrant than can be described by me, which also has been extracted from our red and most pure sea, which is sweet and of a pleasant odour, and is neither sordid nor impure in putrefaction. And know ye that we have given many names to it. which are all true - an example of which, for those that possess understanding, is to be traced in corn that is being ground. For after grinding it is called by another name, and after it has been passed through the sieve, and the various substances have been separated one from another, each of these has its own name, and yet fundamentally there is but one name, to wit, corn, from which many names are distinguished. Thus we call the purple in each grade of its regimen by the name of its own colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophus saith:- I notify to posterity that the nature is male and female, wherefore the envious have called it the body of Magnesia, because therein is the most great arcanum! Accordingly, O all ye seekers after this Art, place Magnesia in its vessel, and cook diligently! Then, opening it after some days, ye shall find the whole changed into water. Cook further until it be coagulated, and contain itself. But, when ye hear of the sea in the books of the envious, know that they signify humour, while by the basket they signify the vessel, and by the medicines they mean Nature, because it germinates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and flowers. But when the envious say: Wash until the blackness of the copper passes away, certain people name this blackness coins. But Agadimon has clearly demonstrated when he boldly put forth these words: It is to be noted, O all ye demonstrators of this art, that the things [or the copper] being first mixed and cooked once, ye shall find the prescribed blackness! That is to say, they all become black. This, therefore, is the lead of the Wise, concerning which they have treated very frequently in their books. Some also call it [the lead] of our black coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras saith:- How marvellous is the diversity of the Philosophers in those things which they formerly asserted, and in their coming together [or agreement], in respect of this small and most common thing, wherein the precious thing is concealed! And if the vulgar knew, O all ye investigators of this art, the same small and vile thing, they would deem it a lie! Yet, if they knew its efficacy, they would not vilify it, but God hath concealed this from the crowd lest the world should be devastated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horfolcus saith:- You must know, O all ye who love wisdom, that whereas Mundus hath been teaching this Art, and placing before you most lucid syllogisms, he that does not understand what he has said is a brute animal! But I will explain the regimen of this small thing, in order that any one, being introduced into this Art, may become bolder, may, more assuredly consider it, and although it be small, may compose the common with that which is dear, and the dear with that which is common. Know ye that in the beginning of the mixing, it behoves you to commingle elements which are crude, gentle, sincere, and not cooked or governed, over a gentle fire. Beware of intensifying the fire until the elements are conjoined, for these should follow one another, and be embraced in a complexion, whereby they are gradually burnt, until they be dessicated in the said gentle fire. And know that one spirit burns one thing and destroys one thing, and one body strengthens one spirit, and teaches the same to contend with the fire. But, after the first combustion, it is necessary that it should be washed, cleansed, and dealbated on the fire until all things become one colour; with which, afterwards, it behoves you to mix the residuum of the whole humour, and then its colour will be exalted. For the elements, being diligently cooked in the fire, rejoice, and are changed into different natures, because the liquefied, which is the lead, becomes not-liquefied, the humid becomes dry, the thick body becomes a spirit, and the fleeing spirit becomes strong and fit to do battle against the fire. Whence the Philosopher saith: Convert the elements and thou shalt find what thou seekest. But to convert the elements is to make the moist dry and the fugitive fixed. These things being accomplished by the disposition, let the operator leave it in the fire until the gross be made subtle, and the subtle remain as a tingeing spirit. Know ye, also, that the death and life of the elements proceed from fire, and that the composite germinates itself, and produces that which ye desire, God favouring. But when the colours begin ye shall behold the miracles of the wisdom of God, until the Tyrian colour be accomplished. O wonder-working Nature, tingeing other natures! O heavenly Nature, separating and converting the elements by regimen! Nothing, therefore, is more precious than these Natures in that Nature which multiplies the composite, and makes fixed and scarlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exemiganus saith:- Thou hast already treated, O Lucas, concerning living and concealed silver, which is Magnesia, as it behoves thee, and thou hast commanded posterity to prove [or to experiment] and to read the books, knowing what the Philosophers have said: Search the latent spirit and disesteem it not, seeing that when it remains it is a great arcanum and effects many good things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucas saith:- I testify to posterity, and what I set forth is more lucid than are your words, that the Philosopher saith: Burn the copper, burn the silver, burn the gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermiganus replies:- Behold something more dark than ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Illumine, therefore, that which is dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- As to that which he said - Burn, burn, burn, the diversity is only in the names, for they are one and the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- Woe unto you! how shortly hast thou dealt with it! why art thou Poisoned with jealousy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Is it desirable that I should speak more clearly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they:- Do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I signify that to whiten is to burn, but to make red is life. For the envious have multiplied many names that they might lead posterity astray, to whom I testify that the definition of this Art is the liquefaction of the body and the separation of the soul from the body, seeing that copper, like a man, has a soul and a body. Therefore, it behoves you, 0 all ye Sons of the Doctrine, to destroy the body and extract the soul therefrom! Wherefore the Philosophers said that the body does not penetrate the body, but that there is a subtle nature, which is the soul, and it is this which tinges and penetrates the body. In nature, therefore, there is a body and there is a soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- Despite your desire to explain, you have put forth dark words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- I signify that the envious have narrated and said that the splendour of Saturn does not appear unless it perchance be dark when it ascends in the air, that Mercury is hidden by the rays of the Sun, that quicksilver vivifies the body by its fiery strength, and thus the work is accomplished. But Venus, when she becomes oriental, precedes the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attamus saith:- Know, O all ye investigators of this Art, that our work, of which ye have been inquiring, is produced by the generation of the sea, by which and with which, after God, the work is completed! Take, therefore, Halsut and old sea stones, and boil with coals until they become white. Then extinguish in white vinegar. If 24 ounces thereof have been boiled, let the heat be extinguished with a third part of the vinegar, that is, 8 ounces; pound with white vinegar, and cook in the sun and black earth for 42 days. But the second work is performed from the tenth day of the month of September to the tenth day [or grade] of Libra. Do not impose the vinegar a second time in this work, but leave the same to be cooked until all its vinegar be dried up and it becomes a fixed earth, like Egyptian earth. And the fact that one work is congealed more quickly and another more slowly, arises from the diversity of cooking. But if the place where it is cooked be humid and dewy it is congealed more quickly, while if it be dry it is congealed more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Florus saith:- I am thinking of perfecting thy treatise, O Mundus, for thou has not accomplished the disposition of the cooking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Proceed, O Philosopher!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Florus:- I teach you, O Sons of the Doctrine, that the sign of the goodness of the first decoction is the extraction of its redness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Describe what is redness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Florus:- When ye see that the matter is entirely black, know that whiteness has been hidden in the belly of that blackness. Then it behoves you to extract that whiteness most subtly from that blackness, for ye know how to discern between them. But in the second decoction let that whiteness be placed in a vessel with its instruments, and let it be cooked gently until it become completely white. But when, O all ye seekers after this Art, ye shall perceive that whiteness appear and flowing over all, be certain that redness is hid in that whiteness! However, it does not behove you to extract it, but rather to cook it until the whole become a most deep red, with which nothing can compare. Know also that the first blackness is produced out of the nature of Marteck, and that redness is extracted from that blackness, which red has improved the black, and has made peace between the fugitive and the non-fugitive, reducing the two into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turba answereth:- And why was this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he:- Because the cruciated matter when it is submerged in the body, changes it into an unalterable and indelible nature. It behoves you, therefore, to know this sulphur which blackens the body. And know ye that the same sulphur cannot be handled, but it cruciates and tinges. And the sulphur which blackens is that which does not open the door to the fugitive and turns into the fugitive with the fugitive. Do you not see that the cruciating does not cruciate with harm or corruption, but by co-adunation and utility of things? For if its victim were noxious and inconvenient, it would not be embraced thereby until its colours were extracted from it unalterable and indelible. This we have called water of sulphur, which water we have prepared for the red tinctures; for the rest it does not blacken; but that which does blacken, and this does not come to pass without blackness, I have testified to be the key of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mundus saith:- Know, all ye investigators of this Art, that the head is all things, which if it hath not, all that it imposes profits nothing. Accordingly, the Masters have said that what is perfected is one, and a diversity of natures does not improve that thing, but one and a suitable nature, which it behoves you to rule carefully, for by ignorance of ruling some have erred. Do not heed, therefore, the plurality of these compositions, nor those things which the philosophers have enumerated in their books. For the nature of truth is one, and the followers of Nature have termed it that one thing in the belly whereof is concealed the natural arcanum. This arcanum is neither seen nor known except by the Wise. He, therefore, who knows how to extract its complexion and rules equably, for him shall a nature rise forth therefrom which shall conquer all natures, and then shall that word be fulfilled which was written by the Masters, namely, that Nature rejoices in Nature, Nature overcomes Nature, and Nature contains Nature; at the same time there are not many or diverse Natures, but one having in itself its own natures and properties, by which it prevails over other things. Do you not see that the Master has begun with one and finished one? Hence has he called those unities Sulphureous Water, conquering all Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bracus saith:- How elegantly Mundus hath described this sulphureous water! For unless solid bodies are destroyed by a nature wanting a body, until the bodies become not-bodies, and even as a most tenuous spirit, ye cannot [attain] that most tenuous and tingeing soul, which is hidden in the natural belly. And know that unless the body be withered up and so destroyed that it dies, and unless ye extract from it its soul, which is a tingeing spirit, ye are unable to tinge a body therewith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophus saith:- The first composition, that is, the body of Magnesia, is made out of several things, although they become one, and are called by one name, which the ancients have termed Albar of copper. But when it is ruled it is called by ten names, taken from the colours which appear in the regimen of the body of this Magnesia. It is necessary, therefore, that the lead be turned into blackness; then the ten aforesaid shall appear in the ferment of gold, with sericon, which is a composition called by ten names. When all these things have been said, we mean nothing more by these names than Albar of copper, because it tinges every body which has entered into the composition. But composition is twofold - one is humid, the other is dry. When they are cooked prudently they become one, and are called the good thing of several names. But when it becomes red it is called Flower of Gold, Ferment of Gold, Gold of Coral, Gold of the Beak. It is also called redundant red sulphur and red orpiment. But while it remains crude lead of copper, it is called bars and plates of metal. Behold I have revealed its names when it is raw, which also we should distinguish from the names when it has been cooked. Let it therefore be pondered over. It behoves me now to exhibit to you the quantity of the fire, and the numbers of its days, and the diversity of intensity thereof in every grade, so that he who shall possess this book may belong unto himself, and be freed from poverty, so that he shall remain secure in that middle way which is closed to those who are deficient in this most precious art. I have seen, therefore, many kinds of fire. One is made out of straw and cinder, coals and flame, but one without flame. Experiment shows that there are intermediate grades between these kinds. But lead is lead of copper, in which is the whole arcanum. Now, concerning the days of the night in which will be the perfection of the most great arcanum, I will treat in its Proper place in what follows. And know most assuredly that if a little gold be placed in the composition, there will result a patent and white tincture. Wherefore also a sublime gold and a patent gold is found in the treasuries of the former philosophers. Wherefore those things are unequal which they introduce into their composition. Inasmuch as the elements are commingled and are turned into lead of copper, coming out of their own former natures, they are turned into a new nature. Then they are called one nature and one genus. These things being accomplished, it is placed in a glass vessel, unless in a certain way the composition drinks the water and is altered in its colours. In every grade it is beheld, when it is coloured by a venerable redness. Although concerning this elixir we read in the sayings of the philosophers: Take gold, occurring frequently, it is only needful to do so once. Wishing, therefore, to know the certitude of the adversary, consider what Democritus saith, how he begins speaking from bottom to top, then reversing matters he proceeds from top to bottom. For, he said: Take iron, lead, and albar for copper, which reversing, he again says: And our copper for coins, lead for gold, gold for gold of coral, and gold of coral for gold of crocus. Again, in the second place, when he begins from the top to the bottom, he saith: Take gold, coin, copper, lead, and iron; he shews, therefore, by his sayings that only semi-gold is taken. And without doubt gold is not changed into rust without lead and copper, and unless it be imbued with vinegar known by the wise, until, being cooked, it is turned into redness. This, therefore, is the redness which all the Philosophers signified, because, how ever they said: Take gold and it becomes gold of coral; Take gold of coral and it becomes purple gold - all these things are only names of those colours, for it behoves them that vinegar be placed in it, because these colours come from it. But by these things which the Philosophers have mentioned under various names, they have signified stronger bodies and forces. It is taken, therefore, once, that it may become rubigo and then vinegar is imposed on it. For when the said colours appear, it is necessary that each be decocted in forty days, so that it may be desiccated, the water being consumed; finally being imbued and placed in the vessel, it is cooked until its utility appear. Its first grade becomes as a citrine mucra, the second as red, the third as the dry pounded crocus of the vulgar. So is it imposed upon coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agmon saith:- I will add the following by way of a corollary. Whosoever does not liquefy and coagulate errs greatly. Therefore, make the earth black; separate the soul and the water thereof, afterwards whiten; so shall ye find what ye seek. I say unto you that whoso makes earth black and then dissolves with fire, till it becomes even like unto a naked sword, who also fixes the whole with consuming fire, deserves to be called happy, and shall be exalted above the circle of the world. This much concerning the revelation of our stone, is, we doubt not, enough for the Sons of the Doctrine. The strength thereof, shall never become corrupted, but the same, when it is placed in the fire, shall be increased. If you seek to dissolve, it shall be dissolved; but if you would coagulate, it shall be coagulated. Behold, no one is without it, and yet all do need it! There are many names given to it, and yet it is called by one only, while, if need be, it is concealed. It is also a stone and not a stone, spirit, soul, and body; it is white, volatile, concave, hairless, cold, and yet no one can apply the tongue with impunity to its surface. If you wish that it should fly, it flies; if you say that it is water, you Speak the truth; if you say that it is not water, you speak falsely. Do not then be deceived by the multiplicity of names, but rest assured that it is one thing, unto which nothing alien is added. Investigate the place thereof, and add nothing that is foreign. Unless the names were multiplied, so that the vulgar might be deceived, many would deride our wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

THE SCIENCE AND NATURE OF ALCHEMY, AND WHAT OPINION SHOULD BE FORMED THEREOF.

&lt;p&gt;Regulated by the Seven Rules or Fundamental Canons according to the seven commonly known Metals; and containing a&lt;br /&gt;
Preface with certain Treatises and Appendices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-preface-of-theophrastus-paracelsus-to-all-alchemists-and-readers-of-this-book.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE PREFACE OF THEOPHRASTUS PARACELSUS TO ALL ALCHEMISTS AND READERS OF THIS BOOK. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-preface-of-theophrastus-paracelsus-to-all-alchemists-and-readers-of-this-book.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU who are skilled in Alchemy, and as many others as promise yourselves great riches or chiefly desire to make gold and silver, which Alchemy in different ways promises and teaches; equally, too, you who willingly undergo toil and vexations, and wish not to be freed from them, until you have attained your rewards, and the fulfilment of the promises made to you; experience teaches this every day, that out of thousands of you not even one accomplishes his desire. Is this a failure of Nature or of Art? I say, no; but it is rather the fault of fate, or of the unskilfulness of the operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, therefore, the characters of the sign of the stars and planets of heaven, together with the other names, inverted words, receipts, materials, and instruments are thoroughly well known to such as are acquainted with this art, it would be altogether superfluous to recur to these same subjects in the present book, although the use of such signs, names, and characters at the proper time is by no means without advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But herein will be noticed another way of treating Alchemy different from the previous method, and deduced by Seven Canons from the sevenfold series of the metals. This, indeed, will not give scope for a pompous parade of words, but, nevertheless, in the consideration of those Canons everything which should be separated from Alchemy will be treated at sufficient length, and, moreover, many secrets of other things are herein contained. Hence, too, result certain marvellous speculations and new operations which frequently differ from the writings and opinions of ancient operators and natural philosophers, but have been discovered and confirmed by full proof and experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;
Moreover, in this Art nothing is more true than this, though it be little known and gains small confidence. All the fault and cause of difficulty in Alchemy, whereby very many persons are reduced to poverty, and others labour in vain, is wholly and solely lack of skill in the operator, and the defect or excess of materials, whether in quantity or quality, whence it ensues that, in the course of operation, things are wasted or reduced to nothing. If the true process shall have been found, the substance itself while transmuting approaches daily more and more towards perfection. The straight road is easy, but it is found by very few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it may happen that a speculative artist may, by his own eccentricity, think out for himself some new method in Alchemy, be the consequence anything or nothing. He need do nought in order to reduce something into nothing, and again bring back something out of nothing. Yet this proverb of the incredulous is not wholly false. Destruction perfects that which is good; for the good cannot appear on account of that which conceals it. The good is least good whilst it is thus concealed. The concealment must be removed that so the good may be able freely to appear in its own brightness. For example, the mountain, the sand, the earth, or the stone in which a metal has grown is such a concealment. Each one of the visible metals is a concealment of the other six metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the element of fire all that is imperfect is destroyed and taken away, as, for instance, the five metals, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Saturn.[^1]. On the other hand, the perfect metals, Sol and Luna, are not consumed in that same fire. They remain in the fire: and at the same time, out of the other imperfect ones which are destroyed, they assume their own body and become visible to the eyes. How, and by what method, this comes about can be gathered from the Seven Canons. Hence it may be learnt what are the nature and property of each metal, what it effects with the other metals, and what are its powers in commixture with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this should be noted in the very first place: that these Seven Canons cannot be perfectly understood by every cursory reader at a first glance or a single reading. An inferior intelligence does not easily perceive occult and abstruse subjects. Each one of these Canons demands no slight discussion. Many persons, puffed up with pride, fancy they can easily comprehend all which this book comprises. Thus they set down its contents as useless and futile, thinking they have something far better of their own, and that therefore they can afford to despise what is here contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-first-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-of-mercury.2&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE FIRST CANON: CONCERNING THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF MERCURY.[^2] &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-first-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-of-mercury.2&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things are concealed in all. One of them all is the concealer of the rest – their corporeal vessel, external, visible, and movable. All liquefactions are manifested in that vessel. For the vessel is a living and corporeal spirit, and so all coagulations or congelations enclosed in it, when prevented from flowing and surrounded, are not therewith content. No name can be found for this liquefaction, by which it may be designated; still less can it be found for its origin. And since no heat is so strong as to be equalised therewith, it should be compared to the fire of Gehenna. A liquefaction of this kind has no sort of connection with others made by the heat of natural fire, or congelated or coagulated by natural cold. These congelations, through their weakness, are unable to obtain in Mercury, and therefore, on that account, he altogether contemns them. Hence one may gather that elementary powers, in their process of destruction, can add nothing to, nor take away anything from, celestial powers (which are called Quintessence or its elements), nor have they any capacity for operating. Celestial and infernal powers do not obey the four elements, whether they be dry, moist, hot, or cold. No one of them has the faculty of acting against a Quintessence; but each one contains within itself its own powers and means of action.[^3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-second-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-of-jupiter.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE SECOND CANON: CONCERNING THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF JUPITER. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-second-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-of-jupiter.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that which is manifest (that is to say, the body of Jupiter) the other six corporeal metals are spiritually concealed, but one more deeply and more tenaciously than another. Jupiter has nothing of a Quintessence in his composition, but is of the nature of the four elementaries. On this account this liquefaction is brought about by the application of a moderate fire, and, in like manner, he is coagulated by moderate cold. He has affinity with the liquefactions of all the other metals. For the more like he is to some other nature, the more easily he is united thereto by conjunction. For the operation of those nearly allied is easier and more natural than of those which are remote. The remote body does not press upon the other. At the same time, it is not feared, though it may be very powerful. Hence it happens that men do not aspire to the superior orders of creation, because they are far distant from them, and do not see their glory. In like manner, they do not much fear those of an inferior order, because they are remote, and none of the living knows their condition or has experienced the misery of their punishment. For this cause an infernal spirit is accounted as nothing. For more remote objects are on that account held more cheaply and occupy a lower place, since according to the propriety of its position each object turns out better, or is transmuted. This can be proved by various examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more remote, therefore, Jupiter is found to be from Mars and Venus, and the nearer Sol and Luna, the more &amp;quot;goldness&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;silveriness&amp;quot;, if I may so say, it contains in its body, and the greater, stronger, more visible, more tangible, more amiable, more acceptable, more distinguished, and more true it is found than in some remote body. Again, the more remote a thing is, of the less account is it esteemed in all the respects aforesaid, since what is present is always preferred before what is absent. In proportion as the nearer is clear the more remote is occult. This, therefore, is a point which you, as an Alchemist, must seriou(S)ly debate with yourself, how you can relegate Jupiter to a remote and abstruse place, which Sol and Luna occupy, and how, in turn, you can summon Sol and Luna from remote positions to a near place, where Jupiter is corporeally posited; so that, in the same way, Sol and Luna also may really be present there corporeally before your eyes. For the transmutation of metals from imperfection to perfection there are several practical receipts. Mix the one with the other. Then again separate the one pure from the other. This is nothing else but the process of permutation, set in order by perfect alchemical labour. Note that Jupiter has much gold and not a little silver. Let Saturn and Luna be imposed on him, and of the rest Luna will be augmented.[^4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-third-canon:-concerning-mars-and-his-properties.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE THIRD CANON: CONCERNING MARS AND HIS PROPERTIES. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-third-canon:-concerning-mars-and-his-properties.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six occult metals have expelled the seventh from them, and have made it corporeal, leaving it little efficacy, and imposing on it great hardness and weight. This being the case, they have shaken off all their own strength of coagulation and hardness, which they manifest in this other body. On the contrary, they have retained in themselves their colour and liquefaction, together with their nobility. It is very difficult and laborious for a prince or a king to be produced out of an unfit and common man. But Mars acquires dominion. with strong and pugnacious hand, and seizes on the position of king. He should, however, be on his guard against snares; that he be not led captive suddenly and unexpectedly. It must also be considered by what method Mars may be able to take the place of king, and Sol and Luna, with Saturn, hold the place of Mars.[^5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fourth-canon:-concerning-venus-and-its-properties.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE FOURTH CANON: CONCERNING VENUS AND ITS PROPERTIES. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fourth-canon:-concerning-venus-and-its-properties.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other six metals have rendered Venus an extrinsical body by means of all their colour and method of liquefaction. It may be necessary, in order to understand this, that we should show, by some examples, how a manifest thing may be rendered occult, and an occult thing rendered materially manifest by means of fire. Whatever is combustible can be naturally transmuted by fire from one form into another, namely, into lime, soot, ashes, glass, colours, stones, and earth. This last can again be reduced to many new metallic bodies. If a metal, too, be burnt, or rendered fragile by old rust, it can again acquire malleability by applications of fire.[^6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fifth-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-op-saturn.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE FIFTH CANON: CONCERNING THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OP SATURN. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-fifth-canon:-concerning-the-nature-and-properties-op-saturn.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of his own nature Saturn speaks thus: The other six have cast me out as their examiner. They have thrust me forth from them and from a spiritual place. They have also added a corruptible body as a place of abode, so that I may be what they neither are nor desire to become. My six brothers are spiritual, and thence it ensues that so often as I am put in the fire they penetrate my body and, together with me, perish in the fire, Sol and Luna excepted. These are purified and ennobled in my water. My spirit is a water softening the rigid and congelated bodies of my brothers. Yet my body is inclined to the earth. Whatever is received into me becomes conformed thereto, and by means of us is converted into one body. It would be of little use to the world if it should learn, or at least believe, what lies hid in me, and what I am able to effect. It would be more profitable it should ascertain what I am able to do with myself. Deserting all the methods of the Alchemists, it would then use only that which is in me and can be done by me. The stone of cold is in me. This is a water by means of which I make the spirits of the six metals congeal into the essence of the seventh, and this is to promote Sol with Luna.[^7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two kinds of Antimony are found: one the common black by which Sol is purified when liquefied therein. This has the closest affinity with Saturn. The other kind is the white, which is also called Magnesia and Bismuth. It has great affinity with Jupiter, and when mixed with the other Antimony it augments Luna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sixth-canon:-concerning-luna-and-the-properties-thereof.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE SIXTH CANON: CONCERNING LUNA AND THE PROPERTIES THEREOF. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-sixth-canon:-concerning-luna-and-the-properties-thereof.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endeavour to make Saturn or Mars out of Luna involves no lighter or easier work than to make Luna, with great gain, out of Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, or Saturn. It is not useful to transmute what is perfect into what is imperfect, but the latter into the former. Nevertheless, it is well to know what is the material of Luna, or whence it proceeds. Whoever is not able to consider or find this out will neither be able to make Luna. It will be asked, What is Luna? It is among the seven metals which are spiritually concealed, itself the seventh, external, corporeal, and material. For this seventh always contains the six metals spiritually hidden in itself. And the six spiritual metals do not exist without one external and material metal. So also no corporeal metal can have place or essence without those six spiritual ones. The seven corporeal metals mix easily by means of liquefaction, but this mixture is not useful for making Sol or Luna. For in that mixture each metal remains in its own nature, or fixed in the fire, or flies from it. For example, mix, in any way you can, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, Sol, and Luna. It will not thence result that Sol and Luna will so change the other five that, by the agency of Sol and Luna, these will become Sol and Luna. For though all be liquefied into a single mass, nevertheless each remains in its nature whatever it is. This is the judgment which must be passed on corporeal mixture. But concerning spiritual mixture and communion of the metals, it should be known that no separation or mortification is spiritual, because such spirits can never exist without bodies. Though the body should be taken away from them and mortified a hundred times in one hour, nevertheless, they would always acquire another much more noble than the former. And this is the transposition of the metals from one death to another, that is to say, from a lesser degree into one greater and higher, namely, into Luna; and from a better into the best and most most perfect, that is, into Sol, the brilliant and altogether royal metal. It is most true, then, as frequently said above, that the six metals always generate a seventh, or produce it from themselves clear in its esse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question may arise: If it be true that Luna and every metal derives its origin and is generated from the other six, what is then its property and its nature? To this we reply: From Saturn, Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Sol, nothing and no other metal than Luna could be made. The cause is that each metal has two good virtues of the other six, of which altogether there are twelve. These are the spirit of Luna, which thus in a few words may be made known. Luna is composed of the six spiritual metals and their virtues, whereof each possesses two. Altogether, therefore, twelve are thus posited in one corporeal metal, which are compared to the seven planets and the twelve celestial signs. Luna has from the planet Mercury, and from Aquarius and Pisces, its liquidity and bright white colour. So Luna has from Jupiter, with Sagittarius and Taurus, its white colour and its great firmness in fire. Luna has from Mars, with Cancer and Aries, its hardness and its clear sound. Luna has from Venus, with Gemini and Libra, its measure of coagulation and its From Saturn, with Virgo and Scorpio, its homogeneous body, with gravity. From Sol, with Leo and Virgo, its spotless purity and great constancy against the power of fire. Such is the knowledge of the natural exaltation and of the course of the spirit and body of Luna, with its composite nature and wisdom briefly summarised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it should be pointed out what kind of a body such metallic spirits acquire in their primitive generation by means of celestial influx. For the metal-digger, when he has crushed the stone, contemptible as it is in appearance, liquefies it, corrupts it, and altogether mortifies it with fire. Then this metallic spirit, in such a process of mortification, receives a better and more noble body, not friable but malleable. Then comes the Alchemist, who again corrupts, mortifies, and artificially prepares such a metallic body. Thus once more that spirit of the metal assumes a more noble and more perfect body, putting itself forward clearly into the light, except it be Sol or Luna. Then at last the metallic spirit and body are perfectly united, are safe from the corruption of elementary fire, and also incorruptible.[^8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-seventh-canon:-concerning-the-nature-of-sol-and-its-properties.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;THE SEVENTH CANON: CONCERNING THE NATURE OF SOL AND ITS PROPERTIES. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#the-seventh-canon:-concerning-the-nature-of-sol-and-its-properties.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventh after the six spiritual metals is corporeally Sol, which in itself is nothing but pure fire. What in outward appearance is more beautiful, more brilliant, more clear and perceptible, a heavier, colder, or more homogeneous body to see? And it is easy to perceive the cause of this, namely, that it contains in itself the congelations of the other six metals, out of which it is made externally into one most compact body. Its liquefaction proceeds from elementary fire, or is caused by the liquations of Mercury, with Pisces and Aquarius, concealed spiritually within it. The most manifest proof of this is that Mercury is easily mingled corporeally with the Sun as in an embrace. But for Sol, when the heat is withdrawn and the cold supervenes after liquefaction, to coagulate and to become hard and solid, there is need of the other five metals, whose nature it embraces in itself – Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, Luna. In these five metals the cold abodes with their regimens are especially found. Hence it happens that Sol can with difficulty be liquefied without the heat of fire, on account of the cold whereof mention has been made. For Mercury cannot assist with his natural heat or liquefaction, or defend himself against the cold of the five metals, because the heat of Mercury is not sufficient to retain Sol in a state of liquefaction. Wherefore Sol has to obey the five metals rather than Mercury alone. Mercury itself has no office of itself save always to flow. Hence it happens that in coagulations of the other metals it can effect nothing, since its nature is not to make anything hard or solid, but liquid. To render fluid is the nature of heat and life, but cold has the nature of hardness, consolidation, and immobility, which is compared to death. For example, the six cold metals, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Mars, Venus, Luna, if they are to be liquefied must be brought to that condition by the heat of fire. Snow or ice, which are cold, will not produce this effect, but rather will harden. As soon as ever the metal liquefied by fire is removed therefrom, the cold, seizing upon it, renders it hard, congelated, and immovable of itself. But in order that Mercury may remain fluid and alive continually, say, I pray you, whether this will be affected with heat on cold? Whoever answers that this is brought about by a cold and damp nature, and that it has its life from cold – the promulgator of this opinion, having no knowledge of Nature, is led away by the vulgar. For the vulgar man judges only falsely, and always holds firmly on to his error. So then let him who loves truth withdraw therefrom. Mercury, in fact, lives not at all from cold but from a warm and fiery nature. Whatever lives is fire, because heat is life, but cold the occasion of death. The fire of Sol is of itself pure, not indeed alive, but hard, and so far shews the colour of sulphur in that yellow and red are mixed therein in due proportion. The five cold metals are Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, and Luna, which assign to Sol their virtues; according to cold, the body itself; according to fire, colour; according to dryness, solidity; according to humidity, weight; and out of brightness, sound. But that gold is not burned in the element of terrestrial fire, nor is even corrupted, is effected by the firmness of Sol. For one fire cannot burn another, or even consume it; but rather if fire be added to fire it is increased, and becomes more powerful in its operations. The celestial fire which flows to us on the earth from the Sun is not such a fire as there is in heaven, neither is it like that which exists upon the earth, but that celestial fire with us is cold and congealed, and it is the body of the Sun. Wherefore the Sun can in no way be overcome by our fire. This only happens, that it is liquefied, like snow or ice, by that same celestial Sun. Fire, therefore, has not the power of burning fire, because the Sun is fire, which, dissolved in heaven, is coagulated with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   Gold is in its              1  Celestial           Dissolved
   Essence three-            { 2  Elementary}   and   Fluid
   fold                        3  Metallic      is    Corporeal.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Whatever, on the other hand, tinges with blackness, or produces black, has a nature in common with death, the properties of darkness, and forces productive of death. The earth with its frigidity is a coagulation and fixation of this kind of hardness. For the house is always dead; but he who inhabits the house lives.

&lt;p&gt;To mortify or congeal Mercury, and afterwards seek to turn it into Luna, and to sublimate it with great labour, is labour in vain, since it involves a dissipation of Sol and Luna existing therein. There is another method, far different and much more concise, whereby, with little waste of Mercury and less expenditure of toil, it is transmuted into Luna without congelation. Any one can at pleasure learn this Art in Alchemy, since it is so simple and easy; and by it, in a short time, he could make any quantity of silver and gold. It is tedious to read long descriptions, and everybody wishes to be advised in straightforward words. Do this, then; proceed as follows, and you will have Sol and Luna, by help whereof you will turn out a very rich man. Wait awhile, I beg, while this process is described to you in few words, and keep these words well digested, so that out of Saturn, Mercury, and Jupiter you may make Sol and Luna. There is not, nor ever will be, any art so easy to find out and practise, and so effective in itself. The method of making Sol and Luna by Alchemy is so prompt that there is no more need of books, or of elaborate instruction, than there would be if one wished to write about last year&#39;s snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, then, shall we say about the receipts of Alchemy, and about the diversity of its vessels and instruments? These are furnaces, glasses, jars, waters, oils, limes, sulphurs, salts, saltpetres, alums, vitriols, chrysocollae, copper-greens, atraments, auri-pigments, fel vitri, ceruse, red earth, thucia, wax, lutum sapientiae, pounded glass, verdigris, soot, testae ovorum, crocus of Mars, soap, crystal, chalk, arsenic, antimony, minium, elixir, lazurium, gold-leaf, salt-nitre, sal ammoniac, calamine stone, magnesia, bolus armenus, and many other things. Moreover, concerning preparations, putrefactions, digestions, probations, solutions, cementings, filtrations, reverberations, calcinations, graduations, rectifications, amalgamations, purgations, etc., with these alchemical books are crammed. Then, again, concerning herbs, roots, seeds, woods, stones, animals, worms, bone dust, snail shells, other shells, and pitch. These and the like, whereof there are some very far-fetched in Alchemy, are mere incumbrances of work; since even if Sol and Luna could be made by them they rather hinder and delay than further one’s purpose. But it is not from these – to say the truth – that the Art of making Sol and Luna is to be learnt. So, then, all these things should be passed by, because they have no effect with the five metals, so far as Sol and Luna are concerned. Someone may ask, What, then, is this short and easy way, which involves no difficulty, and yet whereby Sol and Luna can be made? Our answer is, this has been fully and openly explained in the Seven Canons. It would be lost labour should one seek further to instruct one who does not understand these. It would be impossible to convince such a person that these matters could be so easily understood, but in an occult rather than in an open sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE ART IS THIS: After you have made heaven, or the sphere of Saturn, with its life to run over the earth, place on it all the planets, or such, one or more, as you wish, so that the portion of Luna may be the smallest. Let all run, until heaven, or Saturn, has entirely disappeared. Then all those planets will remain dead with their old corruptible bodies, having meanwhile obtained another new, perfect, and incorruptible body.&lt;br /&gt;
That body is the spirit of heaven. From it these planets again receive a body and life, and live as before. Take this body from the life and the earth. Keep it. It is Sol and Luna. Here you have the Art altogether, clear and entire. If you do not yet understand it, or are not practised therein, it is well. It is better that it should be kept concealed, and not made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-conjure-the-crystal-so-that-all-things-may-be-seen-in-it.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;HOW TO CONJURE THE CRYSTAL SO THAT ALL THINGS MAY BE SEEN IN IT. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#how-to-conjure-the-crystal-so-that-all-things-may-be-seen-in-it.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conjure is nothing else than to observe anything rightly, to know and to understand what it is. The crystal is a figure of the air. Whatever appears in the air, movable or immovable, the same appears also in the speculum or crystal as a wave. For the air, the water, and the crystal, so far as vision is concerned, are one, like a mirror in which an inverted copy of an object is seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;concerning-the-heat-of-mercury.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CONCERNING THE HEAT OF MERCURY. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#concerning-the-heat-of-mercury.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who think that Mercury is of a moist and cold nature are plainly in error, because it is by its nature in the highest degree warm and moist, which is the cause of its being in a constant state of fluidity. If it were of a moist and cold nature it would have the appearance of frozen water, and be always hard and solid, so that it would be necessary to liquefy it by the heat of fire, as in the case of the other metals. But it does not require this, since it has liquidity and flux from its own heat naturally inborn in it, which keeps it in a state of perpetual fluidity and renders it &amp;quot;quick&amp;quot;, so that it can neither die, nor be coagulated, nor congealed. And this is well worth noticing, that the spirits of the seven metals, or as many of them as have been commingled, as soon as they come into the fire, contend with one another, especially Mercury, so that each may put forth its powers and virtues in the endeavour to get the mastery in the way of liquefying and transmuting. One seizes on the virtue, life, and form of another, and assigns some other nature and form to this one. So then the spirits or vapours of the metals are stirred up by the heat to operate mutually one upon the other, and transmute from one virtue to another, until perfection and purity are attained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what must be done besides to Mercury in order that its moisture and heat may be taken away, and in their place such an extreme cold introduced as to congeal, consolidate, and altogether mortify the Mercury? Do what follows in the sentence subjoined: Take pure Mercury closely shut up in a silver pixis. Fill a jar with fragments of lead, in the midst of which place the pixis. Let it melt for twenty-four hours, that is, for a natural day. This takes away from Mercury his occult heat, adds an external heat, and contributes the internal coldness of Saturn and Luna (which are both planets of a cold nature), whence and whereby the Mercury is compelled to congeal, consolidate, and harden.&lt;br /&gt;
Note also that the coldness (which Mercury needs in its consolidation and mortification) is not perceptible by the external sense, as the cold of snow or of ice is, but rather, externally, there is a certain amount of apparent heat. Just in the same way is it with the heat of Mercury, which is the cause of its fluidity. It is not an external heat, perceptible in the same way as one of our qualities. Nay, externally a sort of coldness is perceptible. Whence the Sophists (a race which has more talk than true wisdom) falsely assert that Mercury is cold and of a moist nature, so that they go on and advise us to congeal it by means of heat; whereas heat only renders it more fluid, as they daily find out to their own loss rather than gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Alchemy which alone, by its unique Art, teaches how to fabricate Sol and Luna from the five imperfect metals, allows no other receipt than this, which well and truly says: Only from metals, in metals, by metals, and with metals, are perfect metals made, for in some things is Luna and in other metals is Sol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is need of nothing else but a foundry, bellows, tongs, hammers, cauldrons, jars, and cupels made from beechen ashes. Afterwards, lay on Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and Luna. Let them operate finally up to Saturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hope of finding these in the earth and in stones is most uncertain, and the labour very great. However, since this is the first mode of getting them, it is in no way to be despised, but greatly commended. Such a desire or appetite ought no more to be done away with than the lawful inclination of young people, and those in the prime of life, to matrimony. As the bees long for roses and other flowers for the purpose of making honey and wax, so, too, men – apart from avarice or their own aggrandisement – should seek to extract metal from the earth. He who does not seek it is not likely to find it. God dowers men not only with gold or silver, but also with poverty, squalor, and misery. He has given to some a singular knowledge of metals and minerals, whereby they have obtained an easier and shorter method of fabricating gold and silver, without digging and smelting them, than they were commonly accustomed to, by extracting them from their primitive bodies. And this is the case not only with subterranean substances, but by certain arts and knowledge they have extracted them from the five metals generally (that is to say, from metals excocted from minerals which are imperfect and called metals), viz., from Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and Venus, from all of which, and from each of them separately, Sol and Luna can be made, but from one more easily than from another. Note, that Sol and Luna can be made easily from Mercury, Saturn, and Jupiter, but from Mars and Venus with difficulty. It is possible to make them, however, but with the addition of Sol and Luna. Out of Magnesium and Saturn comes Luna, and out of Jupiter and Cinnabar pure Sol takes its rise. The skilful artist, however (how well I remember!), will be able by diligent consideration to prepare metals so that, led by a true method of reasoning, he can promote the perfection of metallic transformation more than do the courses of the twelve signs and the seven planets. In such matters it is quite superfluous to watch these courses, as also their aspects, good or bad days or hours, the prosperous or unlucky condition of this or that planet, for these matters can do no good, and much less can they do harm in the art of natural Alchemy. If otherwise, and you have a feasible process, operate when you please. If, however, there be anything wanting in you or your mode of working, or your understanding, the planets and the stars of heaven will fail you in your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If metals remain buried long enough in the earth, not only are they consumed by rust, but by long continuance they are even transmuted into natural stones, and there are a great many of these; but this is known to few. For there is found in the earth old stone money of the heathens, printed with their different figures. These coins were originally metallic, but through the transmutation brought about by Nature, they were turned into stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-alchemy-is.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;WHAT ALCHEMY IS. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#what-alchemy-is.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alchemy is nothing else but the set purpose, intention, and subtle endeavour to transmute the kinds of the metals from one to another.[^10] According to this, each person, by his own mental grasp, can choose out for himself a better way and Art, and therein find truth, for the man who follows a thing up more intently does find the truth. It is highly necessary to have a correct estimation of stars and of stones, because the star is the informing spirit of all stones. For the Sol and Luna of all the celestial stars are nothing but one stone in itself; and the terrestrial stone has come forth from the celestial stone; through the same fire, coals, ashes, the same expulsions and repurgations as that celestial stone, it has been separated and brought, clear and pure in its brightness. The whole ball of the earth is only something thrown off, concrete, mixed, corrupted, ground, and again coagulated, and gradually liquefied into one mass, into a stony work, which has its seat and its rest in the midst of the firmamental sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further it is to be remarked that those precious stones which shall forth-with be set down have the nearest place to the heavenly or sidereal ones in point of perfection, purity, beauty, brightness, virtue, power of withstanding fire, and incorruptibility, and they have been fixed with other stones in the earth.[^11]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have, therefore, the greatest affinity with heavenly stones and with the stars, because their natures are derived from these. They are found by men in a rude environment, and the common herd (whose property it is to take false views of things) believe that they were produced in the same place where they are found, and that they were afterwards polished, carried around, and sold, and accounted to be great riches, on account of their colours, beauty, and other virtues. A brief description of them follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emerald&lt;/em&gt;. This is a green transparent stone. It does good to the eyes and the memory. It defends chastity; and if this be violated by him who carries it, the stone itself does not remain perfect.[^12]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Adamant&lt;/em&gt;. A black crystal called Adamant or else Evax, on account of the joy which it is effectual in impressing on those who carry it. It is of an obscure and transparent blackness, the colour of iron. It is the hardest of all; but is dissolved in the blood of a goat. Its size at the largest does not exceed that of a hazel nut.[^13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magnet&lt;/em&gt; Is an iron stone, and so attracts iron to itself.[^14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pearl&lt;/em&gt;. The Pearl is not a stone, because it is produced in sea shells. It is of a white colour. Seeing that it grows in animated beings, in men or in fishes, it is not properly of a stony nature, but properly a depraved (otherwise a transmuted) nature supervening upon a perfect work.[^15]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jacinth&lt;/em&gt; Is a yellow, transparent stone. There is a flower of the same name which, according to the fable of the poets, is said to have been a man.[^16]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sapphire&lt;/em&gt; Is a stone of a celestial colour and a heavenly nature.[^17]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ruby&lt;/em&gt; Shines with an intensely red nature.[^18]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Carbuncle&lt;/em&gt;. A solar stone, shining by its own nature like the sun.[^19]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Coral&lt;/em&gt; Is a white or red stone, not transparent. It grows in the sea, out of the nature of the water and the air, into the form of wood or a shrub; it hardens in the air, and is not capable of being destroyed in fire.[^20]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chalcedony&lt;/em&gt; Is a stone made up of different colours, occupying a middle place between obscurity and transparency, mixed also with cloudiness, and liver coloured. It is the lowest of all the precious stones.[^21]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Topaz&lt;/em&gt; Is a stone shining by night. It is found among rocks.[^22]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amethyst&lt;/em&gt; Is a stone of a purple and blood colour.[^23]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chrysoprasus&lt;/em&gt; Is a stone which appears like fire by night, and like gold by day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Crystal&lt;/em&gt; Is a white stone, transparent, and very like ice. It is sublimated, extracted, and produced from other stones.[^24]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a pledge and firm foundation of this matter, note the following conclusion. If anyone intelligently and reasonably takes care to exercise himself in learning about the metals, what they are, and whence they are produced: he may know that our metals are nothing else than the best part and the spirit of common stones, that is, pitch, grease, fat, oil, and stone. But this is least pure, uncontaminated, and perfect, so long as it remains hidden or mixed with the stones. It should therefore be sought and found in the stones, be recognised in them, and extracted from them, that is, forcibly drawn out and liquefied. For then it is no longer a stone, but an elaborate and perfect metal, comparable to the stars of heaven, which are themselves, as it were, stones separated from those of earth.&lt;br /&gt;
Whoever, therefore, studies minerals and metals must be furnished with such reason and intelligence that he shall not regard only those common and known metals which are found in the depth of the mountains alone. For there is often found at the very surface of the earth such a metal as is not met with at all, or not equally good, in the depths. And so every stone which comes to our view, be it great or small, flint or simple rock, should be carefully investigated and weighed with a true balance, according to its nature and properties. Very often a common stone, thrown away and despised, is worth more than a cow. Regard must not always be had to the place of digging from which this stone came forth; for here the influence of the sky prevails. Everywhere there is presented to us earth, or dust, or sand, which often contain much gold or silver, and this you will mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;WRITTEN AGAINST THOSE SOPHISTS BORN SINCE THE DELUGE, IN THE AGE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD;
By PH. THEOPHRASTUS BOMBAST, of HOHENHEIM,
Philosopher of the Monarchia, Prince of Spagyrists, Chief Astronomer, Surpassing Physician, and Trismegistus of Mechanical Arcana.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;preface.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;PREFACE. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#preface.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SINCE you, O Sophist, everywhere abuse me with such fatuous and mendacious words, on the ground that being sprung from rude Helvetia I can understand and know nothing: and also because being a duly qualified physician I still wander from one district to another; therefore I have proposed by means of this treatise to disclose to the ignorant and inexperienced: what good arts existed in the first age; what my art avails against you and yours against me; what should be thought of each, and how my posterity in this age of grace will imitate me. Look at Hermes, Archelaus, and others in the first age: see what Spagyrists and what Philosophers then existed. By this they testify that their enemies, who are your patrons, O Sophist, at the present time are but mere empty forms and idols. Although this would not be attested by those who are falsely considered your authentic fathers and saints, yet the ancient Emerald Table shews more art and experience in Philosophy, Alchemy, Magic, and the like, than could ever be taught by you and your crowd of followers. If you do not yet understand, from the aforesaid facts, what and how great treasures these are, tell me why no prince or king was ever able to subdue the Egyptians. Then tell me why the Emperor Diocletian ordered all the Spagyric books to be burnt (so far as he could lay his hands upon them). Unless the contents of those books had been known, they would have been obliged to bear still his intolerable yoke, - a yoke, O Sophist, which shall one day be put upon the neck of yourself and your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the middle of this age the Monarchy of all the Arts has been at length derived and conferred on me, Theophrastus Paracelsus, Prince of Philosophy and of Medicine. For this purpose I have been chosen by God to extinguish and blot out all the phantasies of elaborate and false works, of delusive and presumptuous words, be they the words of Aristotle, Galen, Avicenna, Mesva, or the dogmas of any among their followers. My theory, proceeding as it does from the light of Nature, can never, through its consistency, pass away or be changed: but in the fifty-eighth year after its millennium and a half it will then begin to flourish. The practice at the same time following upon the theory will be proved by wonderful and incredible signs, so as to be open to mechanics and common people, and they will thoroughly understand how firm and immovable is that Paracelsic Art against the triflings of the Sophists: though meanwhile that sophistical science has to have its ineptitude propped up and fortified by papal and imperial privileges. In that I am esteemed by you a mendicant and vagabond sophist, the Danube and the Rhine will answer that accusation, though I hold my tongue. Those calumnies of yours falsely devised against me have often displeased many courts and princes, many imperial cities, the knightly order, and the nobility. I have a treasure hidden in a certain city called Weinden, belonging to Forum Julii, at an inn, - a treasure which neither you, Leo of Rome, nor you, Charles the German, could purchase with all your substance. Although the signed star has been applied to the arcanum of your names, it is known to none but the sons of the divine Spagyric Art. So then, you wormy and lousy Sophist, since you deem the monarch of arcana a mere ignorant, fatuous, and prodigal quack, now, in this mid age, I determine in my present treatise to disclose the honourable course of procedure in these matters, the virtues and preparation of the celebrated Tincture of the Philosophers for the use and honour of all who love the truth, and in order that all who despise the true arts may be reduced to poverty. By this arcanum the last age shall be illuminated clearly and compensated for all its losses by the gift of grace and the reward of the spirit of truth, so that since the beginning of the world no similar germination of the intelligence and of wisdom shall ever have been heard of. In the meantime, vice will not be able to suppress the good, nor will the resources of those vicious persons, many though they be, cause any loss to the upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-i.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER I. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-i.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, PHILIPPUS Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast, say that, by Divine grace, many ways have been sought to the Tincture of the Philosophers, which finally all came to the same scope and end. Hermes Trismegistus, the Egyptian, approached this task in his own method. Orus, the Greek, observed the same process. Hali, the Arabian, remained firm in his order. But Albertus Magnus, the German, followed also a lengthy process. Each one of these advanced in proportion to his own method; nevertheless, they all arrive at one and the same end, at a long life, so much desired by the philosophers, and also at an honourable sustenance and means of preserving that life in this Valley of Misery. Now at this time, I, Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast, Monarch of the Arcana, am endowed by God with special gifts for this end, that every searcher after this supreme philosophic work may be forced to imitate and to follow me, be he Italian, Pole, Gaul, German, or whatsoever or whosoever he be. Come hither after me, all you philosophers, astronomers, and spagyrists, of however lofty a name ye may be, I will show and open to you, Alchemists and Doctors, who are exalted by me with the most consummate labours, this corporeal regeneration. I will teach you the tincture, the arcanum1, the quintessence, wherein lie hid the foundations of all mysteries and of all works. For every person may and ought to believe in another only in those matters, which he has tried by fire. If any one shall have brought forward anything contrary to this method of experimentation in the Spagyric Art or in Medicine, there is no reason for your belief in him, since, experimentally, through the agency of fire, the true is separated from the false. The light of Nature indeed is created in this way, that by means thereof the proof or trial of everything may appear, but only to those who walk in this light. With this light we will teach, by the very best methods of demonstration, that all those who before me have approached this so difficult province with their own fancies and acute speculations have, to their own loss, incurred the danger of their foolishness. On which account, from my standpoint, many rustics have been ennobled; but, on the other hand, through the speculative and opinionative art of these many nobles have been changed into clowns, and since they carried golden mountains in their head before they had put their hand to the fire. First of all, then, there must be learnt - digestions, distillations, sublimations, reverberations, extractions, solutions, coagulations, fermentations, fixations, and every instrument which is requisite for this work must be mastered by experience, such as glass vessels, cucurbites, circulators, vessels of Hermes, earthen vessels, baths, blast-furnaces, reverberatories, and instruments of like kind, also marble, coals, and tongs. Thus at length you will be able to profit in Alchemy and in Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so long as, relying on fancy and opinion, you cleave to your fictitious books, you are fitted and predestinated for no one of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-ii:-concerning-the-definition-of-the-subject-and-matter-of-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER II: CONCERNING THE DEFINITION OF THE SUBJECT AND MATTER OF THE TINCTURE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-ii:-concerning-the-definition-of-the-subject-and-matter-of-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I come, then, to the process of the Tincture, it is needful that I open to you the subject thereof: for, up to the present time, this has always been kept in a specially occult way by the lovers of truth. So, then, the matter of the Tincture (when you understand me in a Spagyrical sense) is a certain thing which, by the art of Vulcan2, passes out of three essences into one essence, or it may remain. But, that I may give it its proper name, according to the use of the ancients, though it is called by many the Red Lion, still it is known by few. This, by the aid of Nature and the skill of the Artist himself, can be transmuted into a White Eagle, so that out of one two are produced; and beyond this the brightness of gold does not shine so much for the Spagyrist as do these two when kept in one. Now, if you do not understand the use of the Cabalists and the old astronomers, you are not born by God for the Spagyric art, or chosen by Nature for the work of Vulcan, or created to open your mouth concerning Alchemical Arts. The matter of the Tincture, then, is a very great pearl and a most precious treasure, and the noblest thing next to the manifestation of the Most High and the consideration of men which can exist upon earth. This is the Lili of Alchemy and of Medicine, which the philosophers have so diligently sought after, but, through the failure of entire knowledge and complete preparation, they have not progressed to the perfect end thereof. By means of their investigations and experiments, only the initial stage of the Tincture has been given to us; but the true foundation, which my colleagues must imitate, has been left for me, so that no one should mingle their shadows with our good intentions. I, by right after my long experiences, correct the Spagyrists, and separate the false or the erroneous from the true, since, by long investigations, I have found reasons why I should be able justly to blame and to change diverse things. If, indeed, I had found out experiments of the ancients better than my own, I should scarcely have taken up such great labours as, for the sake, the utility, and the advantage of all good Alchemists, I have undergone willingly. Since, then, the subject of the Tincture has been sufficiently declared, so that it scarcely could or ought to be exceeded in fidelity between two brothers, I approach its preparation, and after I have laid down the experiences of the first age, I wish to add my own inventions; to which at last the Age of Grace will by-and-by give its adhesion, whichever of the patriarchs, O Sophist, you, in the meantime, shall have made leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old Spagyrists putrefied Lili for a philosophical month, and afterwards distilled therefrom the moist spirits, until at length the dry spirits were elevated. They again imbued the caput mortuum with moist spirits, and drew them off from it frequently by distillation until the dry spirits were all elevated. Then afterwards they united the moisture that had been drawn off and the dry spirits by means of a pelican, three or four times, until the whole Lili remained dry at the bottom. Although early experience gave this process before fixation, none the less our ancestors often attained a perfect realisation of their wish by this method. They would, however, have had a shorter way of arriving at the treasure of the Red Lion if they had learnt the agreement of Astronomy with Alchemy, as I have demonstrated it in the Apocalypse of Hermes3. But since every day (as Christ says for the consolation of the faithful) has its own peculiar care, the labour for the Spagyrists before my times has been great and heavy; but this, by the help of the Holy Spirit flowing into us, will, in this last age, be lightened and made clear by my theory and practice, for all those who constantly persevere in their work with patience. For I have tested the properties of Nature, its essences and conditions, and I know its conjunction and resolution, which are the highest and greatest gift for a philosopher, and never understood by the sophists up to this time. When, therefore, the earliest age gave the first experience of the Tincture, the Spagyrists made two things out of one simple. But when afterwards, in the Middle Age, this invention had died out, their successors by diligent scrutiny afterwards came upon the two names of this simple, and they named it with one word, namely, Lili, as being the subject of the Tincture. At length the imitators of Nature putrefied this matter at its proper period just like the seed in the earth, since before this corruption nothing could be born from it, nor any arcanum break forth from it. Afterwards they drew off the moist spirits from the matter, until at length, by the violence of the fire, the dry were also equally sublimated, so that, in this way, just as the rustic does at the proper time of year, they might come to maturity as one after another is wont to ascend and to fall away. Lastly, as after the spring comes summer, they incorporated those fruits and dry spirits, and brought the Magistery of the Tincture to such a point that it came to the harvest, and laid itself out for ripening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-iv:-concerning-the-process-for-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER IV: CONCERNING THE PROCESS FOR THE TINCTURE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-iv:-concerning-the-process-for-the-tincture-of-the-philosophers.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient Spagyrists would not have required such lengthened labour and such wearisome repetition if they had learnt and practised their work in my school. They would have obtained their wish just as well, with far less expense and labour. But at this time, when Theophrastus Paracelsus has arrived as the Monarch of Arcana, the opportunity is at hand for finding out those things which were occult to all Spagyrists before me. Wherefore I say, Take only the rose-coloured blood from the Lion and the gluten from the Eagle. When you have mixed these, coagulate them according to the old process, and you will have the Tincture of the Philosophers, which an infinite number have sought after and very few have found. Whether you will or not, sophist, this Magistery is in Nature itself, a wonderful thing of God above Nature, and a most precious treasure in this Valley of Sorrows. If you look at it from without it seems a paltry thing to transmute another into something far more noble than it was before. But you must, nevertheless, allow this, and confess that it is a miracle produced by the Spagyrist, who by the art of his preparation corrupts a visible body which is externally vile, from which he excites another most noble and most precious essence. If you, in like manner, have learnt anything from the light of Aristotle, or from us, or from the rules of Serapio, come forth, and bring that knowledge experimentally to light. Preserve now the right of the Schools, as becomes a lover of honour and a doctor. But if you know nothing and can do nothing, why do you despise me as though I were an irrational Helvetian cow, and inveigh against me as a wandering vagabond? Art is a second Nature and a universe of its own, as experience witnesses, and demonstrates against you and your idols. Sometimes, therefore, the Alchemist compounds certain simples, which he afterwards corrupts according to his need, and prepares thence another thing. For thus very often out of many things one is made, which effects more than Nature of herself can do, as in Gastaynum it is perfectly well known that Venus is produced from Saturn; in Carinthia, Luna out of Venus; and in Hungary, Sol out of Luna; to pass over in silence for the time being the transmutations of other natural objects, which were well known to the Magi, and more wonderfully than Ovid narrates in his Metamorphoses do they come to the light. That you may rightly understand me, seek your Lion in the East, and your Eagle in the South, for this our work which has been undertaken. You will not find better instruments than Hungary and Istria produce. But if you desire to lead from unity by duality in trinity with equal permutation of each, then you should direct your journey to the South; so in Cyprus shall you gain all your desire, concerning which we must not dilate more profusely than we have done at present. There are still many more of these arcana which exhibit transmutations, though they are known to few. And although these may by the Lord God be made manifest to anyone, still, the rumour of this Art does not on that account at once break forth, but the Almighty gives therewith the understanding how to conceal these and other like arts even to the coming of Elias the Artist, at which time there shall be nothing so occult that it shall not be revealed. You also see with your eyes (though there is no need to speak of these things, which may be taken derisively by some) that in the fire of Sulphur is a great tincture for gems, which, indeed, exalts them to a loftier degree than Nature by herself could do. But this gradation of metals and gems shall be omitted by me in this place, since I have written sufficiently about it in my Secret of Secrets, in my book on the Vexations of Alchemists, and abundantly elsewhere. As I have begun the process of our ancestors with the Tincture of the Philosophers, I will now perfectly conclude it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-v:-concerning-the-conclusion-of-the-process-of-the-ancients.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER V: CONCERNING THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCESS OF THE ANCIENTS. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-v:-concerning-the-conclusion-of-the-process-of-the-ancients.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the ancient Spagyrists having placed Lili in a pelican and dried it, fixed it by means of a regulated increase of the fire, continued so long until from blackness, by permutation into all the colours, it became red as blood, and therewith assumed the condition of a salamander. Rightly, indeed, did they proceed with such labour, and in the same way it is right and becoming that everyone should proceed who seeks this pearl. It will be very difficult for me to make this clearer to you unless you shall have learnt in the School of the Alchemists to observe the degrees of the fire, and also to change your vessels. For then at length you will see that soon after your Lili shall have become heated in the Philosophic Egg, it becomes, with wonderful appearances, blacker than the crow; afterwards, in succession of time, whiter than the swan; and at last, passing through a yellow colour, it turns out more red than any blood. Seek, seek, says the first Spagyrist, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. It would be impious and indecorous to put food in the mouth of a perfidious bird. Let her rather fly to it, even as I, with others before me, have been compelled to do. But follow true Art; for this will lead you to its perfect knowledge. It is not possible that anything should here be set down more fully or more clearly than I have before spoken. Let your Pharisaical schools teach you what they will from their unstable and slippery foundation, which reaches not its end or its aim. When at length you shall have been taught as accurately as possible the Alchemistic Art, nothing in the nature of things shall then at length be so difficult which cannot be made manifest to you by the aid of this Art. Nature, indeed, herself does not bring forth anything into the light which is advanced to its highest perfection, as can be seen in this place from the unity, or the union, of our duality. But a man ought by Spagyric preparations to lead it thither where it was ordained by Nature. Let this have been sufficiently said by me, concerning the process of the ancients and my correction of the Tincture of the Philosophers, so far as relates to its preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, since now we have that treasure of the Egyptians in our hands, it remains that we turn it to our use: and this is offered to us by the Spagyric Magistery in two ways. According to the former mode it can be applied for the renewing of the body; according to the latter it is to be used for the transmutation of metals. Since, then, I, Theophrastus Paracelsus, have tried each of them in different ways, I am willing to put them forward and to describe them according to the signs indeed of the work, and as in experience and proof they appeared to me better and more perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-vi:-concerning-the-transmutation-of-metals-by-the-perfection-of-medicine.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER VI: CONCERNING THE TRANSMUTATION OF METALS BY THE PERFECTION OF MEDICINE. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-vi:-concerning-the-transmutation-of-metals-by-the-perfection-of-medicine.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Tincture of the Philosophers is to be used for transmutation, a pound of it must be projected on a thousand pounds of melted Sol. Then, at length, will a Medicine have been prepared for transmuting the leprous moisture of the metals. This work is a wonderful one in the light of Nature, namely, that by the Magistery, or the operation of the Spagyrist, a metal, which formerly existed, should perish, and another be produced. This fact has rendered that same Aristotle, with his ill-founded philosophy, fatuous. For truly, when the rustics in Hungary cast iron at the proper season into a certain fountain, commonly called Zifferbrunnen, it is consumed into rust, and when this is liquefied with a blast-fire, it soon exists as pure Venus, and never more returns to iron. Similarly, in the mountain commonly called Kuttenberg, they obtain a lixivium out of marcasites, in which iron is forthwith turned into Venus of a high grade, and more malleable than the other produced by Nature. These things, and more like them, are known to simple men rather than to sophists, namely, those which turn one appearance of a metal into another. And these things, moreover, through the remarkable contempt of the ignorant, and partly, too, on account of the just envy of the artificers, remain almost hidden. But I myself, in Istria, have often brought Venus to more than twenty-four (al. 38) degrees, so that the colour of Sol could not mount higher, consisting of Antimony or or Quartal, which Venus I used in all respects as other kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But though the old artists were very desirous of this arcanum, and sought it with the greatest diligence, nevertheless, very few could bring it by means of a perfect preparation to its end. For the transmutation of an inferior metal into a superior one brings with it many difficulties and obstacles, as the change of Jove into Luna, or Venus into Sol. Perhaps on account of their sins God willed that the Magnalia of Nature should be hidden from many men. For sometimes, when this Tincture has been prepared by artists, and they were not able to reduce their projection to work its effects, it happened that, by their carelessness and bad guardianship, this was eaten up by fowls, whose feathers thereupon fell off, and, as I myself have seen, grew again. In this way transmutation, through its abuse from the carelessness of the artists, came into Medicine and Alchemy. For when they were unable to use the Tincture according to their desire, they converted the same to the renovation of men, as shall be heard more at large in the following chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-vii:-concerning-the-renovation-of-men.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER VII: CONCERNING THE RENOVATION OF MEN. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-vii:-concerning-the-renovation-of-men.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the first and primitive philosophers of Egypt have lived by means of this Tincture for a hundred and fifty years. The life of many, too, has been extended and prolonged to several centuries, as is most clearly shewn in different histories, though it seems scarcely credible to any one. For its power is so remarkable that it extends the life of the body beyond what is possible to its congenital nature, and keeps it so firmly in that condition that it lives on in safety from all infirmities. And although, indeed, the body at length comes to old age, nevertheless, it still appears as though it were established in its primal youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, then, the Tincture of the Philosophers is a Universal Medicine, and consumes all diseases, by whatsoever name they are called, just like an invisible fire. The dose is very small, but its effect is most powerful. By means thereof I have cured the leprosy, venereal disease, dropsy, the falling sickness, colic, scab, and similar afflictions; also lupus, cancer, noli-me-tangere, fistulas, and the whole race of internal diseases, more surely than one could believe. Of this fact Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Bohemia, etc., will afford the most ample evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Sophist, look at Theophrastus Paracelsus. How can your Apollo, Machaon, and Hippocrates stand against me? This is the Catholicum of the Philosophers, by which all these philosophers have attained long life for resisting diseases, and they have attained this end entirely and most effectually, and so, according to their judgment, they named it The Tincture of the Philosophers. For what can there be in the whole range of medicine greater than such purgation of the body, by means whereof all superfluity is radically removed from it and transmuted? For when the seed is once made sound all else is perfected. What avails the ill-founded purgation of the sophists since it removes nothing as it ought? This, therefore, is the most excellent foundation of a true physician, the regeneration of the nature, and the restoration of youth. After this, the new essence itself drives out all that is opposed to it. To effect this regeneration, the powers and virtues of the Tincture of the Philosophers were miraculously discovered, and up to this time have been used in secret and kept concealed by true Spagyrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;NOTES &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#notes&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arcanum of a substance is not the virtue (virtus) but the essence (vir) and the potency (potentia), and is stronger than the virtue; nevertheless, an old error of the doctors conferred the name of virtues upon the potential essences. - Paramirum, Lib. IV. Many things are elsewhere set forth concerning the Quintessence, but what is described is really a separation or extraction of the pure from the impure, not a true quintessence, and it is more correctly termed an Arcanum. -Explicatio Totius Astronomiae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office of Vulcan is the separation of the good from the bad. So the Art of Vulcan, which is Alchemy, is like unto death, by which the eternal and the temporal are divided one from another. So also this art might be called the death of things. - De Morbis Metallicis, Lib. I., Tract III., c. 1. Vulcan is an astral and not a corporal fabricator. - De Caduco Matricis, Par. VI. The artist working in metals and other minerals transforms them into other colours, and in so doing his operation is like that of the heaven itself. For as the artist excocts by means of Vulcan, or the igneous element, so heaven performs the work of coction through the Sun. The Sun, therefore, is the Vulcan of heaven accomplishing coction in the earth. - De Icteritiis. Vulcan is the fabricator and architect of all things, nor is his habitation in heaven only, that is, in the firmament, but equally in all the other elements. - Lib. Meteorum, c. 4. Where the three prime principles are wanting, there also the igneous essence is absent. The Igneous Vulcan is nothing else but Sulphur, Sal Nitrum, and Mercury. - Ibid., c.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Book of the Revelation of Hermes, interpreted by Theophrastus Paracelsus, concerning the Supreme Secret of the World, seems to have been first brought to light by Benedictus Figulus, and appeared as a piece de résistance in his &amp;quot;Golden and Blessed Casket of Nature&#39;s Marvels&amp;quot;, of which an English translation has been very recently published. (&amp;quot;A Golden and Blessed Casket of Nature&#39;s Marvels&amp;quot;. By Benedictus Figulus. Now first done into English from the German original published at Frankfort in the year 1608. London: James Elliott and Co. 8vo., 1893). Among the many writings which have been fabulously attributed to Hermes, there does not seem to be any record of an apocalypse, and it is impossible to say what forged document may have been the subject of interpretation by Paracelsus. As the collection of Figulus is now so readily accessible, it is somewhat superfluous to reproduce the treatise here, but since this translation claims to include everything written by the physician of Hohenheim on the subject of Alchemy and the Universal Medicine, it is appended at this point. It should be premised that Benedictus Figulus complains bitterly of the mutilation and perversion to which the works of Paracelsus were subjected, and the Revelation of Hermes seems in many parts to betray another hand, especially in its quotation of authorities who are not countenanced by its reputed author. Hermes, Plato, Aristotle, and other philosophers, flourishing at different times, who have introduced the Arts, and more especially have explored the secrets of inferior Creation, all these have eagerly sought a means whereby man&#39;s body might be preserved from decay and become endued with immortality. To them it was answered that there is nothing which might deliver the mortal body from death; but that there is One Thing which may postpone decay, renew youth; and prolong short human life (as with the patriarchs). For death was laid as a punishment upon our first parents, Adam and Eve, and will never depart from all their descendants. Therefore, the above philosophers, and many others, have sought this One Thing with great labour, and have found that that which preserves the human body from corruption, and prolongs life, conducts itself, with respect to other elements, as it were like the Heavens; from which they understood that the Heavens are a substance above the Four Elements. And just as the Heavens, with respect to the other elements, are held to be the fifth substance (for they are indestructible, stable, and suffer no foreign admixture), so also this One Thing (compared to the forces of our body) is an indestructible essence, drying up all the superfluities of our bodies, and has been philosophically called by the above-mentioned name. It is neither hot and dry like fire, nor cold and moist like water, nor warm and moist like air, nor dry and cold like earth. But it is a skilful, perfect equation of all the Elements, a right commingling of natural forces, a most particular union of spiritual virtues, an indissoluble uniting of body and soul. It is the purest and noblest substance of an indestructible body, which cannot be destroyed nor harmed by the Elements, and is produced by Art. With this, Aristotle prepared an apple, prolonging life by its scent, when he, fifteen days before his death, could neither eat nor drink on account of old age. This spiritual Essence, or One Thing, was revealed from above to Adam, and was greatly desired by the Holy Fathers; this also Hermes and Aristotle call the Truth without Lies, the most sure of all things certain, the Secret of all Secrets. It is the Last and the Highest Thing to be sought under the Heavens, a wondrous closing and finish of philosophical work, by which are discovered the dews of Heaven and the fastnesses of Earth. What the mouth of man cannot utter is all found in this spirit. As Morienus says: &amp;quot;He who has this has all things, and wants no other aid. For in it are all temporal happiness, bodily health, and earthly fortune. It is the spirit of the fifth substance, a Fount of all Joys ( beneath the rays of the moon), the Supporter of Heaven and Earth, the Mover of Sea and Wind, the Outpourer of Rain, upholding the strength of all things, an excellent spirit above Heavenly and other spirits, giving Health, Joy, Peace, Love; driving away Hatred and Sorrow, bringing in Joy, expelling all Evil, quickly healing all Diseases, destroying Poverty and misery, leading to all good things, preventing all evil words and thoughts, giving man his heart&#39;s desire, bringing to the pious earthly honour and long life, but to the wicked who misuse it, Eternal Punishment&amp;quot;. This is the Spirit of Truth, which the world cannot comprehend without the interposition of the Holy Ghost, or without the instruction of those who know it. The same is of a mysterious nature, wondrous strength, boundless power. The Saints, from the beginning of the world, have desired to behold its face. By Avicenna this Spirit is named the Soul of the World. For, as the Soul moves all the limbs of the body, so also does this Spirit move all bodies. And as the Soul is in all the limbs of the Body, so also is this Spirit in all elementary created things. It is sought by many and found by few. It is beheld from afar and found near; for it exists in every thing, in every place, and at all times. It has the powers of all creatures; its action is found in all elements, and the qualities of all things are therein, even in the highest perfection. By virtue of this essence did Adam and the Patriarchs preserve their health and live to an extreme age, some of them also flourishing in great riches. When the philosophers had discovered it, with great diligence and labour, they straightway concealed it under a strange tongue, and in parables, lest the same should become known to the unworthy, and the pearls be cast before swine. For if everyone knew it, all work and industry would cease; man would desire nothing but this one thing, people would live wickedly, and the world be ruined, seeing that they would provoke God by reason of their avarice and superfluity. For eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath the heart of man understood what Heaven hath naturally incorporated with this Spirit. Therefore have I briefly enumerated some of the qualities of this Spirit, to the Honour of God, that the pious may reverently praise Him in His gifts (which gift of God shall afterwards come to them), and I will herewith shew what powers and virtues it possesses in each thing, also its outward appearance, that it may be more readily recognised. In its first state, it appears as an impure earthly body, full of imperfections. It then has an earthly nature, healing all sickness and wounds in the bowels of man, producing good and consuming proud flesh, expelling all stench, and healing generally, inwardly and outwardly. In its second nature, it appears as a watery body, somewhat more beautiful than before, because (although still having its corruptions) its Virtue is greater. It is much nearer the truth, and more effective in works. In this form it cures cold and hot fevers and is a specific against poisons, which it drives from heart and lungs, healing the same when injured or wounded, purifying the blood, and, taken three times a day, is of great comfort in all diseases. But in its third nature it appears as an aerial body, of an oily nature, almost freed from all imperfections, in which form it does many wondrous works, producing beauty and strength of body, and (a small quantity being taken in the food) preventing melancholy and heating of the gall, increasing the quantity of the blood and seed, so that frequent bleeding becomes necessary. It expands the blood vessels, cures withered limbs, restores strength to the sight, in growing persons removes what is superfluous and makes good defects in the limbs. In its fourth nature it appears in a fiery form (not quite freed from all imperfections, still somewhat watery and not dried enough), wherein it has many virtues, making the old young and reviving those at the point of death. For if to such an one there be given, in wine, a barleycorn&#39;s weight of this fire, so that it reach the stomach, it goes to his heart, renewing him at once, driving away all previous moisture and poison, and restoring the natural heat of the liver. Given in small doses to old people, it removes the diseases of age, giving the old young hearts and bodies. Hence it is called the Elixir of Life. In its fifth and last nature, it appears in a glorified and illuminated form, without defects, shining like gold and silver, wherein it possesses all previous powers and virtues in a higher and more wondrous degree. Here its natural works are taken for miracles. When applied to the roots of dead trees they revive, bringing forth leaves and fruit. A lamp, the oil of which is mingled with this spirit, continues to burn for ever without diminution. It converts crystals into the most precious stones of all colours, equal to those from the mines, and does mayn other incredible wonders which may not be revealed to the unworthy. For it heals all dead and living bodies without other medicine. Here Christ is my witness that I lie not, for all heavenly influences are united and combined therein. This essence also reveals all treasures in earth and sea, converts all metallic bodies into gold, and there is nothing like unto it under Heaven. This spirit is the secret hidden from the beginning, yet granted by God to a few holy men for the revealing of these iches to His Glory - dwelling in fiery form in the air, and leading earth with itself to heaven, while from its body there flow whole rivers of living water. This spirit flies through the midst of the Heavens like a morning mist, leads its burning fire into the water, and has its shining realm in the heavens. And although these writings may be regarded as false by the reader, yet to the initiated they are true and possible, when the hidden sense is properly understood. For God is wonderful in His works, and His wisdom is without end. This spirit in its fiery form is called a Sandaraca, in the aerial a Kybrick, in the watery an Azoth, in the earthly Alcohoph and Aliocosoph. Hence they are deceived by these names who, seeking without instruction, think to find this Spirit of Life in things foreign to our Art. For although this spirit which we seek, on account of its qualities, is called by these names, yet the same is not in these bodies and cannot be in them. For a refined spirit cannot appear except in a body suitable to its nature. And, by however many names it be called, let no one imagine there be different spirits, for, say what one will, there is but one spirit working everywhere and in all things. That is the spirit which, when rising, illumines the Heavens, when setting incorporates the purity of Earth, and when brooding has embraced the Waters. This spirit is named Raphael, the Angel of God, the subtlest and purest, whom the others all obey as their King. This spiritual substance is neither heavenly nor hellish, but an airy, pure, and hearty body, midway between the highest and lowest, without reason, but fruitful in works, and the most select and beautiful of all other heavenly things. This work of God is far too deep for understanding, for it is the last, greatest, and highest secret of Nature. It is the Spirit of God, which in the Beginning filled the earth and brooded over the waters, which the world cannot grasp without the gracious interposition of the Holy Spirit and instruction from those who know it, which also the whole world desires for its virtue, and which cannot be prized enough. For it reaches to the planets, raises the clouds, drives away mists, gives its light to all things, turns everything into Sun and Moon, bestows all health and abundance of treasure, cleanses the leper, brightens the eyes, banishes sorrow, heals the sick, reveals all hidden treasures, and, generally, cures all diseases. Through this spirit have the philosophers invented the Seven Liberal Arts, and thereby gained their riches. Through the same Moses made the golden vessels in the Ark, and King Solomon did many beautiful works to the honour of God. Therewith Moses built the Tabernacle, Noah the Ark, Solomon the Temple. By this, Ezra restored the Law, and Miriam, Moses&#39; sister, was hospitable; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and other righteous men, have had lifelong abundance and riches; and all the saints possessing it have therewith praised God. Therefore is its acquisition very hard, more than that of gold and silver. For it is the best of all things, because, of all things mortal that man can desire in this world, nothing can compare with it, and in it alone is truth. Hence it is called the Stone and Spirit of Truth; in its works is no vanity, its praise cannot be sufficiently expressed. I am unable to speak enough of its virtues, because its good qualities and powers are beyond human thoughts, unutterable by the tongue of man, and in it are found the properties of all things. Yea, there is nothing deeper in Nature. O unfathomable abyss of God&#39;s Wisdom, which thus hath united and comprised in the virtue and power of this One Spirit the qualities of all existing bodies! O unspeakable honour and boundless joy granted to mortal man! For the destructible things of Nature are restored by virtue of the said Spirit. O mystery of mysteries, most secret of all secret things, and healing and medicine of all things! Thou last discovery in earthly natures, last best gift to Patriarchs and Sages, greatly desired by the whole world! Oh, what a wondrous and laudable spirit is purity, in which stand all joy, riches, fruitfulness of life, and art of all arts, a power which to its initiates grants all material joys! O desirable knowledge, lovely above all things beneath the circle of the Moon, by which Nature is strengthened, and heart and limbs are renewed, blooming youth is preserved, old age driven away, weakness destroyed, beauty in its perfection preserved, and abundance ensured in all things pleasing to men! O thou spiritual substance, lovely above all things! O thou wondrous power, strengthening all the world! O thou invincible virtue, highest of all that is, although despised by the ignorant, yet held by the wise in great praise, honour, and glory, that - proceeding from humours - wakest the dead, expellest diseases, restorest the voice of the dying! O thou treasure of treasures, mystery of mysteries, called by Avicenna &amp;quot;an unspeakable substance&amp;quot;, the purest and most perfect soul of the world, than which there is nothing more costly under Heaven, unfathomable in nature and power, wonderful in virtue and works, having no equal among creatures, possessing the virtues of all bodies under Heaven! For from it flow the water of life, the oil and honey of eternal healing, and thus hath it nourished them with honey and water from the rock. Therefore, saith Morienus: &amp;quot;He who hath it, the same also hath all things&amp;quot;. Blessed art Thou, Lord God of our Fathers, in that Thou hast given the prophets this knowledge and understanding, that they have hidden these things (lest they should be discovered by the blind, and those drowned in worldly godlessness) by which the wise and the pious have praised Thee! For the discoverers of the mystery of this thing to the unworthy are breakers of the seal of Heavenly Revelation, thereby offending God&#39;s Majesty, and bringing upon themselves many misfortunes and the punishments of God. Therefore, I beg all Christians, possessing this knowledge, to communicate the same to nobody, except it be to one living in Godliness, of well-proved virtue, and praising God, Who has given such a treasure to man. For many seek, but few find it. Hence the impure and those living in vice are unworthy of it. Therefore is this Art to be shewn to all God-fearing persons, because it cannot be bought with a price. I testify before God that I lie not, although it appear impossible to fools, that no one has hitherto explored Nature so deeply. The Almighty be praised for having created this Art and for revealing it to God-fearing men. Amen. And thus is fulfilled this precious and excellent work, called the revealing of the occult spirit, in which lie hidden the secrets and mysteries of the world. But this spirit is one genius, and divine, wonderful, and lordly power. For it embraces the whole world, and overcomes the Elements and the fifth Substance. To our Trismegistus Spagyrus, Jesus Christ, be praise and glory immortal. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;` By Philippus Theophrastus Bombast, Paracelsus the Great&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NATURE begets a mineral in the bowels of the earth. There are two kinds of it, which are found in many districts of Europe. The best which has been offered to me, which also has been found genuine in experimentation, is externally in the figure of the greater world, and is in the eastern part of the sphere of the Sun. The other, in the Southern Star, is now in its first efflorescence. The bowels of the earth thrust this forth through its surface. It is found red in its first coagulation, and in it lie hid all the flowers and colours of the minerals. Much has been written about it by the philosophers, for it is of a cold and moist nature, and agrees with the element of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far as relates to the knowledge of it and experiment with it, all the philosophers before me, though they have aimed at it with their missiles, have gone very wide of the mark. They believed that Mercury and Sulphur were the mother of all metals, never even dreaming of making mention meanwhile of a third; and yet when the water is separated from it by Spagyric Art the truth is plainly revealed, though it was unknown to Galen or to Avicenna. But if, for the sake of our excellent physicians, we had to describe only the name, the composition; the dissolution, and coagulation, as in the beginning of the world Nature proceeds with all growing things, a whole year would scarcely suffice me, and, in order to explain these things, not even the skins of numerous cows would be adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I assert that in this mineral are found three principles, which are Mercury, Sulphur, and the Mineral Water which has served to naturally coagulate it. Spagyric science is able to extract this last from its proper juice when it is not altogether matured, in the middle of the autumn, just like a pear from a tree. The tree potentially contains the pear. If the Celestial Stars and Nature agree , the tree first of all puts forth shoots in the month of March; then it thrusts out buds, and when these open the flower appears, and so on in due order until in autumn the pear grows ripe. So is it with the minerals. These are born, in like manner, in the bowels of the earth. Let the Alchemists who are seeking the Treasure of Treasures carefully note this. I will shew them the way, its beginning, its middle, and its end. In the following treatise I will describe the proper Water, the proper Sulphur, and the proper Balm thereof. By means of these three the resolution and composition are coagulated into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;concerning-the-sulphur-of-cinnabar.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CONCERNING THE SULPHUR OF CINNABAR. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#concerning-the-sulphur-of-cinnabar.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take mineral Cinnabar and prepare it in the following manner. Cook it with rain water in a stone vessel for three hours. Then purify it carefully, and dissolve it in Aqua Regis, which is composed of equal parts of vitriol, nitre, and sal ammoniac. Another formula is vitriol, saltpetre, alum, and common salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distil this in an alembic. Pour it on again, and separate carefully the pure from the impure thus. Let it putrefy for a month in horse-dung; then separate the elements in the following manner. If it puts forth its sign1, commence the distillation by means of an alembic with a fire of the first degree. The water and the air will ascend; the fire and the earth will remain at the bottom. Afterwards join them again, and gradually treat with the ashes. So the water and the air will again ascend first, and afterwards the element of fire, which expert artists recognise. The earth will remain in the bottom of the vessel. This collect there. It is what many seek after and few find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dead earth in the reverberatory you will prepare according to the rules of Art, and afterwards add fire of the first degree for five days and nights. When these have elapsed you must apply the second degree for the same number of days and nights, and proceed according to Art with the material enclosed. At length you will find a volatile salt, like a thin alkali, containing in itself the Astrum of fire and earth2. Mix this with the two elements that have been preserved, the water and the earth. Again place it on the ashes for eight days and eight nights, and you will find that which has been neglected by many Artists. Separate this according to your experience, and according to the rules of the Spagyric Art, and you will have a white earth, from which its colour has been extracted. Join the element of fire and salt to the alkalised earth. Digest in a pelican to extract the essence. Then a new earth will be deposited, which put aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;concerning-the-red-lion.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CONCERNING THE RED LION. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#concerning-the-red-lion.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards take the lion in the pelican which also is found [at] first, when you see its tincture, that is to say, the element of fire which stands above the water, the air, and the earth. Separate it from its deposit by trituration. Thus you will have the true aurum potabile3. Sweeten this with the alcohol of wine poured over it, and then distil in an alembic until you perceive no acidity to remain in the Aqua Regia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Oil of the Sun, enclosed in a retort hermetically sealed, you must place for elevation that it may be exalted and doubled in its degree. Then put the vessel, still closely shut, in a cool place. Thus it will not be dissolved, but coagulated. Place it again for elevation and coagulation, and repeat this three times. Thus will be produced the Tincture of the Sun, perfect in its degree. Keep this in its own place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;concerning-the-green-lion.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CONCERNING THE GREEN LION. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#concerning-the-green-lion.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the vitriol of Venus4, carefully prepared according to the rules of Spagyric Art; and add thereto the elements of water and air which you have reserved. Resolve, and set to putrefy for a month according to instructions. When the putrefaction is finished, you will behold the sign of the elements. Separate, and you will soon see two colours, namely, white and red. The red is above the white. The red tincture of the vitriol is so powerful that it reddens all white bodies, and whitens all red ones, which is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work upon this tincture by means of a retort, and you will perceive a blackness issue forth. Treat it again by means of the retort, repeating the operation until it comes out whitish. Go on, and do not despair of the work. Rectify until you find the true, clear Green Lion, which you will recognise by its great weight. You will see that it is heavy and large. This is the Tincture, transparent gold. You will see marvellous signs of this Green Lion, such as could be bought by no treasures of the Roman Leo. Happy he who has learnt how to find it and use it for a tincture!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the true and genuine Balsam5, the Balsam of the Heavenly Stars, suffering no bodies to decay, nor allowing leprosy, gout, or dropsy to take root. It is given in a dose of one grain, if it has been fermented with Sulphur of Gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, Charles the German, where is your treasure? Where are your philosophers? Where your doctors? Where are your decocters of woods, who at least purge and relax? Is your heaven reversed? Have your stars wandered out of their course, and are they straying in another orbit, away from the line of limitation, since your eyes are smitten with blindness, as by a carbuncle, and other things making a show of ornament, beauty, and pomp? If your artists only knew that their prince Galen - they call none like him - was sticking in hell, from whence he has sent letters to me, they would make the sign of the cross upon themselves with a fox&#39;s tail. In the same way your Avicenna sits in the vestibule of the infernal portal; and I have disputed with him about his aurum potabile, his Tincture of the Philosophers, his Quintessence, and Philosophers&#39; Stone, his Mithridatic, his Theriac, and all the rest. O, you hypocrites, who despise the truths taught you by a true physician, who is himself instructed by Nature, and is a son of God himself! Come, then, and listen, impostors who prevail only by the authority of your high positions! After my death, my disciples will burst forth and drag you to the light, and shall expose your dirty drugs, wherewith up to this time you have compassed the death of princes, and the most invincible magnates of the Christian world. Woe for your necks in the day of judgment! I know that the monarchy will be mine. Mine, too, will be the honour and glory. Not that I praise myself: Nature praises me. Of her I am born; her I follow. She knows me, and I know her. The light which is in her I have beheld in her; outside, too, I have proved the same in the figure of the microcosm, and found it in that universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I must proceed with my design in order to satisfy my disciples to the full extent of their wish. I willingly do this for them, if only skilled in the light of Nature and thoroughly practised in astral matters, they finally become adepts in philosophy, which enables them to know the nature of every kind of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, then, of this liquid of the minerals which I have described, four parts by weight; of the Earth of red Sol two parts; of Sulphur of Sol one part. Put these together into a pelican, congelate, and dissolve them three times. Thus you will have the Tincture of the Alchemists. We have not here described its weight: but this is given in the book on Transmutations6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now, he who has one to a thousand ounces of the Astrum Solis shall also tinge his own body of Sol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the Astrum of Mercury, in the same manner, you will tinge the whole body of common Mercury. If you have the Astrum of Venus you will, in like manner, tinge the whole body of Venus, and change it into the best metal. These facts have all been proved. The same must also be understood as to the Astra of the other planets, as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Luna, and the rest. For tinctures are also prepared from these: concerning which we now make no mention in this place, because we have already dwelt at sufficient length upon them in the book on the Nature of Things and in the Archidoxies. So, too, the first entity of metals and terrestrial minerals have been made, sufficiently clear for Alchemists to enable them to get the Alchemists&#39; Tincture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work, the Tincture of the Alchemists, need not be one of nine months; but quickly, and without any delay, you may go on by the Spaygric Art of the Alchemists, and, in the space of forty days, you can fix this alchemical substance, exalt it, putrefy it, ferment it, coagulate it into a stone, and produce the Alchemical Phoenix7. But it should be noted well that the Sulphur of Cinnabar becomes the Flying Eagle, whose wings fly away without wind, and carry the body of the phoenix to the nest of the parent, where it is nourished by the element of fire, and the young ones dig out its eyes: from whence there emerges a whiteness, divided in its sphere, into a sphere and life out of its own heart, by the balsam of its inward parts, according to the property of the cabalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sign is nothing else than the mark left by an operation. The house constructed by the architect is the sign of his handicraft whereby his skill and art are determined. Thus the sign is the achievement itself. - De Colica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth also has its Astrum, its course, its order, just as much as the Firmament, but peculiar to the element. So also there is an Astrum in the water, even as in the earth, and in like manner with air and fire. Consequently, the upper Astrum has the Astra of the elements for its medium and operates through them by an irresistible attraction. Through this operation of the superior and inferior Astra, all things are fecundated, and led on to their end. - Explicatio Totius Astronomiae. Without the Astra the elements cannot flourish. ... In the Astrum of the earth all the celestial operations thrive. The Astrum itself is hidden, the bodies are manifest. ... The motion of the earth is brought about by the Astrum of the earth. ... There are four Astra in man (corresponding to those of the four elements), for he is the lesser world. - De Caducis, Par. II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aurum Potabile, that is, Potable Gold, Oil of Gold, and Quintessence of Gold, are distinguished thus. Aurum Potabile is gold rendered potable by intermixture with other substances, and with liquids. Oil of Gold is an oil extracted from the precious metal without the addition of anything. The Quintessence of Gold is the redness of gold extracted therefrom and separated from the body of the metal. - De Membris Contractis, Tract II., c. 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If copper be pounded and resolved without a corrosive, you have Vitriol. From this may be prepared the quintessence, oil, and liquor thereof. - De Morbis Tartareis. Cuprine Vitriol is Vitriol cooked with Copper. - De Morbis Vermium, Par. 6. Chalcanthum is present in Venus, and Venus can by separation be reduced into Chalcanthum. - Chirurgia Magna. Pars. III., Lib. IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, indeed, diffused through all things a Balsam created by God, without which putrefaction would immediately supervene. Thus in corpses which are anointed with Balsam we see that corruption is arrested and thus in the physical body we infer that there is a certain natural and congenital Balsam, in the absence of which the living and complete man would not be safe from putrefaction. Nothing removes the Balsam but death. But this kind differs from what is more commonly called Balsam, in that the one is conservative of the living, and the other of the dead. - Chirurgia Magna, Pt. II., Tract II., c 3. The confection of Balsam requires special knowledge of chemistry, and it was first discovered by the Alchemists. - Ibid., Pt. I., Tract II., c. 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to identify the treatise to which reference is made here. It does not seem to be the seventh book concerning The Nature of Things, nor the ensuing tract on Cements. The general question of natural and artificial weight is discussed in the Aurora of the Philosophers. No detached work on Transmutations has come down to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that the Phoenix is the soul of the Iliaster (that is, the first chaos of the matter of all things). ... It is also the Iliastic soul in man. - Liber Azoth, S. V., Practica Lineae Vitae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADAM was the first inventor of arts, because he had knowledge of all things as well after the Fall as before[^26]. Thence he predicted the world’s destruction by water. From this cause, too, it came about that his successors erected two tables of stone, on which they engraved all natural arts in hieroglyphical characters, in order that their posterity might also become acquainted with this prediction, that so it might be heeded, and provision made in the time of danger. Subsequently, Noah found one of these tables under Mount Araroth, after the Deluge. In this table were described the courses of the upper firmament and of the lower globe, and also of the planets. At length this universal knowledge was divided into several parts, and lessened in its vigour and power. By means of this separation, one man became an astronomer, another a magician, another a cabalist, and a fourth an alchemist. Abraham, that Vulcanic Tubalcain, a consummate astrologer and arithmetician, carried the Art out of the land of Canaan into Egypt, whereupon the Egyptians rose to so great a height and dignity that this wisdom was derived from them by other nations. The patriarch Jacob painted, as it were, the sheep with various colours; and this was done by magic: for in the theology of the Chaldeans, Hebrews, Persians, and Egyptians, they held these arts to be the highest philosophy, to be learnt by their chief nobles and priests. So it was in the time of Moses, when both thc priests and also thc physicians were chosen from among the Magi – the priests for the judgment of what related to health, especially in the knowledge of leprosy. Moses, likewise, was instructed in the Egyptian schools, at the cost and care of Pharaoh’s daughter, so that he excelled in all the wisdom and learning of that people. Thus, too, was it with Daniel, who in his youthful days imbibed the learning of the Chaldeans, so that he became a cabalist. Witness his divine predictions and his exposition of those words, &amp;quot;Mene, Mene, Tecelphares&amp;quot;. These words can be understood by the prophetic and cabalistic Art. This cabalistic Art was perfectly familiar to, and in constant use by, Moses and the Prophets. The Prophet Elias foretold many things by his cabalistic numbers. So did the Wise Men of old, by this natural and mystical Art, learn to know God rightly. They abode in His laws, and walked in His statutes with great firmness. It is also evident in the Book of Samuel, that the Berelists did not follow the devil’s part, but became, by Divine permission, partakers of visions and veritable apparitions, whereof we shall treat more at large in the Book of Supercelestial Things[^27]. This gift is granted by the Lord God to those priests who walk in the Divine precepts. It was a custom among the Persians never to admit any one as king unless he were a Wise Man, pre-eminent in reality as well as in name. This is clear from the customary name of their kings; for they were called Wise Men. Such were those Wise Men and Persian Magi who came from the East to seek out thc Lord Jesus, and are called natural priests. The Egyptians, also, having obtained this magic and philosophy from the Chaldeans and Persians, desired that their priests should learn the same wisdom; and they became so fruitful and successful therein that all the neighbouring countries admired them. For this reason Hermes was so truly named Trismegistus, because he was a king, a priest, a prophet, a magician, and a sophist of natural things. Such another was Zoroaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a son of Noah possessed the third part of the world after the Flood, this Art broke into Chaldaea and Persia, and thence spread into Egypt. The Art having been found out by the superstitious and idolatrous Greeks, some of them who were wiser than the rest betook themselves to the Chaldeans and Egyptians, so that they might draw the same wisdom from their schools. Since, however, the theological study of the law of Moses did not satisfy them, they trusted to their own peculiar genius, and fell away from the right foundation of those natural secrets and arts. This is evident from their fabulous conceptions, and from their errors respecting the doctrine of Moses. It was the custom of the Egyptians to put forward the traditions of that surpassing wisdom only in enigmatical figures and abstruse histories and terms. This was afterwards followed by Homer with marvellous poetical skill; and Pythagoras was also acquainted with it, seeing that he comprised in his writings many things out of the law of Moses and the Old Testament. In like manner, Hippocrates, Thales of Miletus, Anaxagoras, Democritus, and others, did not scruple to fix their minds on the same subject. And yet none of them were practised in the true Astrology, Geometry, Arithmetic, or Medicine, because their pride prevented this, since they would not admit disciples belonging to other nations than their own. Even when they had got some insight from the Chaldeans and Egyptians, they became more arrogant still than they were before by Nature, and without any diffidence propounded the subject substantially indeed, but mixed with subtle fictions or falsehoods; and then they attempted to elaborate a certain kind of philosophy which descended from them to the Latins. These in their turn, being educated herewith, adorned it with their own doctrines, and by these the philosophy was spread over Europe. Many academies were founded for the propagation of their dogmas and rules, so that the young might be instructed; and this system flourishes with the Germans, and other nations, right down to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-iii:-what-was-taught-in-the-schools-of-the-egyptians.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER III: WHAT WAS TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE EGYPTIANS. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-iii:-what-was-taught-in-the-schools-of-the-egyptians.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chaldeans, Persians, and Egyptians had all of them the same knowledge of the secrets of Nature, and also the same religion. It was only the names that differed. The Chaldeans and Persians called their doctrine Sophia and Magic[^28]; and the Egyptians, because of the sacrifice, called their wisdom priestcraft. The magic of the Persians, and the theology of the Egyptians, were both of them taught in the schools of old. Though there were many schools and learned men in Arabia, Africa, and Greece, such as Albumazar, Abenzagel, Geber, Rhasis, and Avicenna among the Arabians; and among the Greeks, Machaon, Podalirius, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Plato, Aristotle, and Rhodianus; still there were different opinions amongst them as to the wisdom of the Egyptian on points wherein they themselves differed, and whereupon they disagreed with it. For this reason Pythagoras could not be called a wise man, because the Egyptian priestcraft and wisdom were not perpectly taught, although he received therefrom many mysteries and arcana; and that Anaxagoras had received a great many as well, is clear from his discussions on the subject of Sol and its Stone, which he left behind him after his death. Yet he differed in many respects from the Egyptians. Even they would not be called wise men or Magi; but, following Pythagoras, they assumed the name of philosophy: yet they gathered no more than a few gleams like shadows from the magic of the Persians and the Egyptians. But Moses, Abraham, Solomon, Adam, and the wise men that came from the East to Christ, were true Magi, divine sophists and cabalists. Of this art and wisdom the Greeks knew very little or nothing at all; and therefore we shall leave this philosophical wisdom of the Greeks as being a mere speculation, utterly distinct and separate from other true arts and sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-iv:-what-magi-the-chaldeans-persians-and-egyptians-were.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER IV: WHAT MAGI THE CHALDEANS, PERSIANS, AND EGYPTIANS WERE. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-iv:-what-magi-the-chaldeans-persians-and-egyptians-were.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many persons have endeavoured to investigate and make use of the secret magic of these wise men; but it has not yet been accomplished. Many even of our own age exalt Trithemius, others Bacon and Agrippa, for magic and the cabala[^29]5 – two things apparently quite distinct – not knowing why they do so. Magic, indeed, is an art and faculty whereby the elementary bodies, their fruits, properties, virtues, and hidden operations are comprehended. But the cabala, by a subtle understanding of the Scriptures, seems to trace out the way to God for men, to shew them how they may act with Him, and prophesy from Him; for the cabala is full of divine mysteries, even as Magic is full of natural secrets. It teaches of and foretells from the nature of things to come as well as of things present, since its operation consists in knowing the inner constitution of all creatures, of celestial as well as terrestrial bodies: what is latent within them; what are their occult virtues; for what they were originally designed, and with what properties they are endowed. These and the like subjects are the bonds wherewith things celestial are bound up with things of the earth, as may sometimes be seen in their operation even with the bodily eyes. Such a conjunction of celestial influences, whereby the heavenly virtues acted upon inferior bodies, was formerly called by the Magi a Gamahea[^30], or the marriage of the celestial powers and properties with elementary bodies. Hence ensued the excellent commixtures of all bodies, celestial and terrestrial, namely, of the sun and planets, likewise vegetables, minerals, and animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devil attempted with his whole force and endeavour to darken this light; nor was he wholly frustrated in his hopes, for he deprived all Greece of it, and, in place thereof, introduced among that people human speculations and simple blasphemies against God and against His Son. Magic, it is true, had its origin in the Divine Ternary and arose from the Trinity of God. For God marked all His creatures with this Ternary and engraved its hieroglyph on them with His own finger. Nothing in the nature of things can be assigned or produced that lacks this magistery of the Divine Ternary, or that does not even ocularly prove it. The creature teaches us to understand and see the Creator Himself, as St. Paul testifies to the Romans. This covenant of the Divine Ternary, diffused throughout the whole substance of things, is indissoluble. By this, also, we have the secrets of all Nature from the four elements. For the Ternary, with the magical Quaternary, produces a perfect Septenary, endowed with many arcana and demonstrated by things which are known. When the Quaternary rests in the Ternary, then arises the Light of the World on the horizon of eternity, and by the assistance of God gives us the whole bond. Here also it refers to the virtues and operations of all creatures, and to their use, since they are stamped and marked with their arcana, signs, characters, and figures, so that there is left in them scarcely the smallest occult point which is not made clear on examination. Then when the Quaternary and the Ternary mount to the Denary is accomplished their retrogression or reduction to unity. Herein is comprised all the occult wisdom of things which God has made plainly manifest to men, both by His word and by the creatures of His hands, so that they may have a true knowledge of them. This shall be made more clear in another place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magi in their wisdom asserted that all creatures might be brought to one unified substance, which substance they affirm may, by purifications and purgations, attain to so high a degree of subtlety, such divine nature and occult property, as to work wonderful results. For they considered that by returning to the earth, and by a supreme magical separation, a certain perfect substance would come forth, which is at length, by many industrious and prolonged preparations, exalted and raised up above the range of vegetable substances into mineral, above mineral into metallic, and above perfect metallic substances into a perpetual and divine Quintessence[^31], including in itself the essence of all celestial and terrestrial creatures. The Arabs and Greeks, by the occult characters and hieroglyphic descriptions of the Persians and the Egyptians, attained to secret and abstruse mysteries. When these were obtained and partially understood they saw with their own eyes, in the course of experimenting, many wonderful and strange effects. But since the supercelestial operations lay more deeply hidden than their capacity could penetrate, they did not call this a supercelestial arcanum according to the institution of the Magi, but the arcanum of the Philosophers’ Stone according to the counsel and judgment of Pythagoras. Whoever obtained this Stone overshadowed it with various enigmatical figures, deceptive resemblances, comparisons, and fictitious titles, so that its matter might remain occult. Very little or no knowledge of it therefore can be had from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-vi:-concerning-the-different-errors-as-to-its-discovery-and-knowledge.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER VI: CONCERNING THE DIFFERENT ERRORS AS TO ITS DISCOVERY AND KNOWLEDGE. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-vi:-concerning-the-different-errors-as-to-its-discovery-and-knowledge.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophers have prefixed most occult names to this matter of the Stone, grounded on mere similitudes. Arnold, observing this, says in his &amp;quot;Rosary&amp;quot; that the greatest difficulty is to find out the material of this Stone; for they have called it vegetable, animal, and mineral, but not according to the literal sense, which is well known to such wise men as have had experience of divine secrets and the miracles of this same Stone. For example, Raymond Lully’s &amp;quot;Lunaria&amp;quot; may be cited. This gives flowers of admirable virtues familiar to the philosophers themselves; but it was not the intention of those philosophers that you should think they meant thereby any projection upon metals, or that any such preparations should be made; but the abstruse mind of the philosophers had another intention. In like manner, they called their matter by the name of Martagon, to which they applied an occult alchemical operation; when, notwithstanding that name, it denotes nothing more than a hidden similitude. Moreover, no small error has arisen in the liquid of vegetables, with which a good many have sought to coagulate Mercury[^32], and afterwards to convert it with fixatory waters into Luna, since they supposed that he who in this way could coagulate it without the aid of metals would succeed in becoming the chief master. Now, although the liquids of some vegetables do effect this, yet the result is due merely to the resin, fat, and earthy sulphur with which they abound. This attracts to itself the moisture of the Mercury which rises with the substance in the process of coagulation, but without any advantage resulting. I am well assured that no thick and external Sulphur in vegetables is adapted for a perfect projection in Alchemy, as some have found out to their cost. Certain persons have, it is true, coagulated Mercury with the white and milky juice of tittinal, on account of the intense heat which exists therein; and they have called that liquid &amp;quot;Lac Virginis&amp;quot;; yet this is a false basis. The same may be asserted concerning the juice of celandine, although it colours just as though it were endowed with gold. Hence people conceived a vain idea. At a certain fixed time they rooted up this vegetable, from which they sought for a soul or quintessence, wherefrom they might make a coagulating and transmuting tincture. But hence arose nothing save a foolish error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-vii:-concerning-the-errors-of-those-who-seek-the-stone-in-vegetables.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER VII: CONCERNING THE ERRORS OF THOSE WHO SEEK THE STONE IN VEGETABLES. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-vii:-concerning-the-errors-of-those-who-seek-the-stone-in-vegetables.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some alchemists have pressed a juice out of celandine, boiled it to thickness, and put it in the sun, so that it might coagulate into a hard mass, which, being afterwards pounded into a fine black powder, should turn Mercury by projection into Sol. This they also found to be in vain. Others mixed Sal Ammoniac with this powder; others the Colcothar of Vitriol, supposing that they would thus arrive at their desired result. They brought it by their solutions into a yellow water, so that the Sal Ammoniac allowed an entrance of the tincture into the substance of the Mercury. Yet again nothing was accomplished. There are some again who, instead of the abovementioned substances, take the juices of persicaria, bufonaria, dracunculus, the leaves of willow, tithymal, cataputia, flammula, and the like, and shut them up in a glass vessel with Mercury for some days, keeping them in ashes. Thus it comes about that the Mercury is turned into ashes, but deceptively and without any result. These people were misled by the vain rumours of the vulgar, who give it out that he who is able to coagulate Mercury without metals has the entire Magistery, as we have said before. Many, too, have extracted salts, oils, and sulphurs artificially out of vegetables, but quite in vain. Out of such salts, oils, and sulphurs no coagulation of Mercury, or perfect projection, or tincture, can be made. But when the philosophers compare their matter to a certain golden tree of seven boughs, they mean that such matter includes all the seven metals in its sperm, and that in it these lie hidden. On this account they called their matter vegetable, because, as in the case of natural trees, they also in their time produce various flowers. So, too, the matter of the Stone shews most beautiful colours in the production of its flowers. The comparison, also, is apt, because a certain matter rises out of the philosophical earth, as if it were a thicket of branches and sprouts: like a sponge growing on the earth. They say, therefore, that the fruit of their tree tends towards heaven. So, then, they put forth that the whole thing hinged upon natural vegetables, though not as to its matter, because their stone contains within itself a body, soul, and spirit, as vegetables do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-viii:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-in-animals.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER VIII: CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT THE STONE IN ANIMALS. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-viii:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-in-animals.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have also, by a name based only on resemblances, called this matter Lac Virginis, and the Blessed Blood of Rosy Colour, which, nevertheless, suits only the prophets and sons of God. Hence the sophists[^33] gathered that this philosophical matter was in the blood of animals or of man. Sometimes, too, because they are nourished by vegetables, others have sought it in hairs, in salt of urine, in rebis; others in hens’ eggs, in milk, and in the calx of egg shells, with all of which they thought they would be able to fix Mercury. Some have extracted salt out of foetid urine, supposing that to be the matter of the Stone. Some persons, again, have considered the little stones found in rebis to be the matter. Others have macerated the membranes of eggs in a sharp lixivium, with which they also mixed calcined egg shells as white as snow. To these they have attributed the arcanum of fixation for the transmutation of Mercury. Others, comparing the white of the egg to silver and the yolk to gold, have chosen it for their matter, mixing with it common salt, sal ammoniac, and burnt tartar. These they shut up in a glass vessel, and puri6ed in a Balneum Maris until the white matter became as red as blood. This, again, they distilled into a most offensive liquid, utterly useless for the purpose they had in view. Others have purified the white and yolk of eggs; from which has been generated a basilisk. This they burnt to a deep red powder, and sought to tinge with it, as they learnt from the treatise of Cardinal Gilbert. Many, again, have macerated the galls of oxen, mixed with common salt, and distilled this into a liquid, with which they moistened the cementary powders, supposing that, by means of this Magistery, they would tinge their metals. This they called by the name of &amp;quot;a part with a part&amp;quot;, and thence came – just nothing. Others have attempted to transmute tutia by the addition of dragon’s blood and other substances, and also to change copper and electrum into gold. Others, according to the Venetian Art, as they call it, take twenty lizard-like animals, more or less, shut them up in a vessel, and make them mad with hunger, so that they may devour one another until only one of them survives. This one is then fed with filings of copper or of electrum. They suppose that this animal, simply by the digestion of his stomach, will bring about the desired transmutation. Finally, they burn this animal into a red powder, which they thought must be gold; but they were deceived. Others, again, having burned the fishes called truitas (? trouts), have sometimes, upon melting them, found some gold in them; but there is no other reason for it than this: Those fish sometimes in rivers and streams meet with certain small scales and sparks of gold, which they eat. It is seldom, however, that such deceivers are found, and then chiefly in the courts of princes. The matter of the philosophers is not to be sought in animals: this I announce to all. Still, it is evident that the philosophers called their Stone animal, because in their final operations the virtue of this most excellent fiery mystery caused an obscure liquid to exude drop by drop from the matter in their vessels. Hence they predicted that, in the last times, there should come a most pure man upon the earth, by whom the redemption of the world should be brought about; and that this man should send forth bloody drops of a red colour, by means of which he should redeem the world from sin. In the same way, after its own kind, the blood of their Stone freed the leprous metals from their infirmities and contagion. On these grounds, therefore, they supposed they were justified in saying that their Stone was animal. Concerning this mystery Mercurius speaks as follows to King Calid: –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This mystery it is permitted only to the prophets of God to know. Hence it comes to pass that this Stone is called animal, because in its blood a soul lies hid. It is likewise composed of body, spirit, and soul. For the same reason they called it their microcosm, because it has the likeness of all things in the world, and thence they termed it animal, as Plato named the great world an animal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-ix:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-in-minerals.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER IX: CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT THE STONE IN MINERALS. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-ix:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-in-minerals.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereto are added the many ignorant men who suppose the stone to be three-fold, and to be hidden in a triple genus, namely, vegetable, animal, and mineral. Hence it is that they have sought for it in minerals. Now, this is far from the opinion of the philosophers. They affirm that their stone is uniformly vegetable, animal, and mineral. Now, here note that Nature has distributed its mineral sperm into various kinds, as, for instance, into sulphurs, salts, boraxes, nitres, ammoniacs, alums, arsenics, atraments, vitriols, tutias, haematites, orpiments, realgars, magnesias, cinnabar, antimony, talc, cachymia, marcasites, etc. In all these Nature has not yet attained to our matter; although in some of the species named it displays itself in a wonderful aspect for the transmutation of imperfect metals that are to be brought to perfection. Truly, long experience and practice with fire shew many and various permutations in the matter of minerals, not only from one colour to another, but from one essence to another, and from imperfection to perfection. And, although Nature has, by means of prepared minerals, reached some perfection, yet philosophers will not have it that the matter of the philosophic stone proceeds out of any of the minerals, although they say that their stone is universal. Hence, then, the sophists take occasion to persecute Mercury himself with various torments, as with sublimations, coagulations, mercurial waters, aquafortis, and the like. All these erroneous ways should be avoided, together with other sophistical preparations of minerals, and the purgations and fixations of spirits and metals. Wherefore all the preparations of the stone, as of Geber, Albertus Magnus, and the rest, are sophistical. Their purgations, cementations, sublimations, distillations, rectifications, circulations, putrefactions, conjunctions, solutions, ascensions, coagulations, calcinations, and incinerations are utterly profitless, both in the tripod, in the athanor, in the reverberatory furnace, in the melting furnace, the accidioneum, in dung, ashes, sand, or what not; and also in the cucurbite, the pelican, retort, phial, fixatory, and the rest. The same opinion must be passed on the sublimation of Mercury by mineral spirits, for the white and the red, as by vitriol, saltpetre, alum, crocuses, etc., concerning all which subjects that sophist, John de Rupescissa, romances in his treatise on the White and Red Philosophic Stone. Taken altogether, these are merely deceitful dreams. Avoid also the particular sophistry of Geber; for example, his sevenfold sublimations or mortifications, and also the revivifications of Mercury, with his preparations of salts of urine, or salts made by a sepulchre, all which things are untrustworthy. Some others have endeavoured to fix Mercury with: the sulphurs of minerals and metals, but have been greatly deceived. It is true I have seen Mercury by this Art, and by such fixations, brought into a metallic body resembling and counterfeiting good silver in all respects; but when brought to the test it has shewn itself to be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-x:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-and-also-particulars-in-minerals.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER X: CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT THE STONE AND ALSO PARTICULARS IN MINERALS. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-x:-concerning-those-who-have-sought-the-stone-and-also-particulars-in-minerals.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sophists have tried to squeeze out a fixed oil from Mercury seven times sublimed and as often dissolved by means of aquafortis. In this way they attempt to bring imperfect metals to perfection: but they have been obliged to relinquish their vain endeavour. Some have purged vitriol seven times by calcination, solution, and coagulation, with the addition of two parts of sal ammoniac, and by sublimation, so that it might be resolved into a white water, to which they have added a third part of quicksilver, that it might be coagulated by water. Then afterwards they have sublimated the Mercury several times from the vitriol and sal ammoniac, so that it became a stone. This stone they affirmed, being conceived of the vitriol, to be the Red Sulphur of the philosophers, with which they have, by means of solutions and coagulations, made some progress in attaining the stone; but in projection it has all come to nothing. Others have coagulated Mercury by water of alum into a hard mass like alum itself; and this they have fruitlessly fixed with fixatory waters. The sophists propose to themselves very many ways of fixing Mercury, but to no purpose, for therein nothing perfect or constant can be had. It is therefore in vain to add minerals thereto by sophistical processes, since by all of them he is stirred up to greater malice, is rendered more lively, and rather brought to greater impurity than to any kind of perfection. So, then, the philosophers’ matter is not to be sought from thence. Mercury is somewhat imperfect; and to bring it to perfection will be very difficult, nay, impossible for any sophist. There is nothing therein that can be stirred up or compelled to perfection. Some have taken arsenic several times sublimated, and frequently dissolved with oil of tartar and coagulated. This they have pretended to fix, and by it to turn copper into silver. This, however, is merely a sophistical whitening, for arsenic cannot be fixed[^34] unless the operator be an Artist, and knows well its tingeing spirit. Truly in this respect all the philosophers have slept, vainly attempting to accomplish anything thereby. Whoever, therefore, is ignorant as to this spirit, cannot have any hopes of fixing it, or of giving it that power which would make it capable of the virtue of transmutation. So, then, I give notice to all that the whitening of which I have just now spoken is grounded on a false basis, and that by it the copper is deceitfully whitened, but not changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the sophists have mixed this counterfeit Venus with twice its weight of Luna, and sold it to the goldsmiths and mint-masters, until at last they have transmuted themselves into false coiners – not only those who sold, but those who bought it. Some sophists instead of white arsenic take red, and this has turned out false art; because, however it is prepared, it proves to be nothing but whiteness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, again, have gone further and dealt with common sulphur, which, being so yellow, they have boiled in vinegar, lixivium, or sharpest wines, for a day and a night, until it became white. Then afterwards they sublimated it from common salt and the calx of eggs, repeating the process several times; yet, still, though white, it has been always combustible. Nevertheless, with this they have endeavoured to fix Mercury and to turn it into gold; but in vain. From this, however, comes the most excellent and beautiful cinnabar that I have ever seen. This they propose to fix with the oil of sulphur by cementation and fixation. It does, indeed, give something of an appearance, but still falls short of the desired object. Others have reduced common sulphur to the form of a hepar, boiling it in vinegar with the addition of linseed oil, or laterine oil, or olive oil. They then pour it into a marble mortar, and make it into the form of a hepar, which they have first distilled into a citrine oil with a gentle fire. But they have found to their loss that they could not do anything in the way of transmuting Luna to Sol as they supposed they would be able. As there is an infinite number of metals, so also there is much variety in the preparation of them: I shall not make further mention of these in this place, because each a mould require a special treatise. Beware also of sophisticated oils of vitriol and antimony. Likewise be on your guard against the oils of the metals, perfect or imperfect, as Sol or Luna; because although the operation of these is most potent in the nature of things, yet the true process is known, even at this day, to very few persons. Abstain also from the sophistical preparations of common mercury, arsenic, sulphur, and the like, by sublimation, descension, fixation by vinegar, saltpetre, tartar, vitriol, sal ammoniac, according to the formulas prescribed in the books of the sophists. Likewise avoid the sophisticated tinctures taken from marcasites and crocus of Mars, and also of that sophistication called by the name of &amp;quot;a part with a part&amp;quot;, and of fixed Luna and similar trifles. Although they have some superficial appearance of truth, as the fixation of Luna by little labour and industry, still the progress of the preparation is worthless and weak. Being therefore moved with compassion towards the well meaning operators in this art, I have determined to lay open the whole foundation of philosophy in three separate arcana, namely, in one explained by arsenic, in a second by vitriol, and in a third by antimony; by means of which I will teach the true projection upon Mercury and upon the imperfect metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-xi:-concerning-the-true-and-perfect-special-arcanum-of-arsenic-for-the-white-tincture.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER XI: CONCERNING THE TRUE AND PERFECT SPECIAL ARCANUM OF ARSENIC FOR THE WHITE TINCTURE. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xi:-concerning-the-true-and-perfect-special-arcanum-of-arsenic-for-the-white-tincture.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some persons have written that arsenic is compounded of Mercury and, Sulphur, others of earth and water; but most writers say that it is of the nature of Sulphur. But, however that may be, its nature is such that it transmutes red copper into white. It may also be brought to such a perfect state of preparation as to be able to tinge. But this is not done in the way pointed out by such evil sophists as Geber in &amp;quot;The Sum of Perfection&amp;quot;, Albertus Magnus, Aristotle the chemist in &amp;quot;The Book of the Perfect Magistery&amp;quot;, Rhasis and Polydorus; for those writers, however many they be, are either themselves in error, or else they write falsely out of sheer envy, and put forth receipts whilst not ignorant of the truth. Arsenic contains within itself three natural spirits. The first is volatile, combustible, corrosive, and penetrating all metals. This spirit whitens Venus and after some days renders it spongy. But this artifice relates only to those who practise the caustic art. The second spirit is crystalline and sweet. The third is a tingeing spirit separated from the others before mentioned. True philosophers seek for these three natural properties in arsenic with a view to the perfect projection of the wise men[^35]. But those barbers who practise surgery seek after that sweet and crystalline nature separated from the tingeing spirit for use in the cure of wounds, buboes, carbuncles, anthrax, and other similar ulcers which are not curable save by gentle means. As for that tingeing spirit, however, unless the pure be separated from the impure in it, the fixed from the volatile, and the secret tincture from the combustible, it will not in any way succeed according to your wish for projection on Mercury, Venus, or any other imperfect metal. All philosophers have hidden this arcanum as a most excellent mystery. This tingeing spirit, separated from the other two as above, you must join to the spirit of Luna, and digest them together for the space of thirty-two days, or until they have assumed a new body. After it has, on the fortieth natural day, been kindled into flame by the heat of the sun, the spirit appears in a bright whiteness, and is endued with a perfect tingeing arcanum. Then it is at length fit for projection, namely, one part of it upon sixteen parts of an imperfect body, according to the sharpness of the preparation. From thence appears shining and most excellent Luna, as though it had been dug from the bowels of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-xii:-general-instruction-concerning-the-arcanum-of-vitriol-and-the-red-tincture-to-be-extracted-from-it.36&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER XII: GENERAL INSTRUCTION CONCERNING THE ARCANUM OF VITRIOL AND THE RED TINCTURE TO BE EXTRACTED FROM IT.[^36] &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xii:-general-instruction-concerning-the-arcanum-of-vitriol-and-the-red-tincture-to-be-extracted-from-it.36&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitriol is a very noble mineral among the rest, and was held always in highest estimation by philosophers, because the Most High God has adorned it with wonderful gifts. They have veiled its arcanum in enigmatical figures like the following: &amp;quot;Thou shalt go to the inner parts of the earth, and by rectification thou shalt find the occult stone, a true medicine&amp;quot;. By the earth they understood the Vitriol itself; and by the inner parts of the earth its sweetness and redness, because in the occult part of the Vitriol lies hid a subtle, noble, and most fragrant juice, and a pure oil. The method of its production is not to be approached by calcination or by distillation. For it must not be deprived on any account of its green colour. If it were, it would at the same time lose its arcanum and its power. Indeed, it should be observed at this point that minerals, and also vegetables and other like things which shew greenness without, contain within themselves an oil red like blood, which is their arcanum. Hence it is clear that the distillations of the druggists are useless, vain, foolish, and of no value, because these people do not know how to extract the bloodlike redness from vegetables. Nature herself is wise, and turns all the waters of vegetables to a lemon colour, and after that into an oil which is very red like blood. The reason why this is so slowly accomplished arises from the too great haste of the ignorant operators who distil it, which causes the greenness to be consumed. They have not learnt to strengthen Nature with their own powers, which is the mode whereby that noble green colour ought to be rectified into redness of itself. An example of this is white wine digesting itself into a lemon colour; and in process of time the green colour of the grape is of itself turned into the red which underlies the coerulean. The greenness therefore of the vegetables and minerals being lost by the incapacity of the operators, the essence also and spirit of the oil and of the balsam, which is noblest among arcana, will also perish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-xiii:-special-instruction-concerning-the-process-of-vitriol-for-the-red-tincture.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER XIII: SPECIAL INSTRUCTION CONCERNING THE PROCESS OF VITRIOL FOR THE RED TINCTURE. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xiii:-special-instruction-concerning-the-process-of-vitriol-for-the-red-tincture.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitriol contains within itself many muddy and viscous imperfections. Therefore its greenness[^37] must be often extracted with water, and rectified until it puts off all the impurities of earth. When all these rectifications are finished, take care above all that the matter shall not be exposed to the sun, for this turns its greenness pale, and at the same time absorbs the arcanum. Let it be kept covered up in a warm stove so that no dust may defile it. Afterwards let it be digested in a closed glass vessel for the space of several months, or until different colours and deep redness shew themselves. Still you must not suppose that by this process the redness is sufficiently fixed. It must, in addition, be cleansed from the interior and accidental defilements of the earth, in the following manner: – It must be rectified with acetum until the earthy defilement is altogether removed, and the dregs are taken away. This is now the true and best rectification of its tincture, from which the blessed oil is to be extracted. From this tincture, which is carefully enclosed in a glass vessel, an alembic afterwards placed on it and luted so that no spirit may escape, the spirit of this oil must be extracted by distillation over a mild and slow fire. This oil is much pleasanter and sweeter than any aromatic balsam of the drugsellers, being entirely free from all acridity[^38]. There will subside in tha bottom of the cucurbite some very white earth, shining and glittering like snow. This keep, and protect from all dust. This same earth is altogether separated from its redness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereupon follows the greatest arcanum, that is to say, the Supercelestial Marriage of the Soul, consummately prepared and washed by the blood of the lamb, with its own splendid, shining, and purified body. This is the true supercelestial marriage by which life is prolonged to the last and predestined day. In this way, then, the soul and spirit of the Vitriol, which are its blood, are joined with its purified body, that they may be for eternity inseparable. Take, therefore, this our foliated earth in a glass phial. Into it pour gradually its own oil. The body will receive and embrace its soul; since the body is affected with extreme desire for the soul, and the soul is most perfectly delighted with the embrace of the body. Place this conjunction in a furnace of arcana, and keep it there for forty days. When these have expired you will have a most absolute oil of wondrous perfection, in which Mercury and any other of the imperfect metals are turned into gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let us turn our attention to its multiplication. Take the corporal Mercury, in the proportion of two parts; pour it over three parts, equal in weight, of the aforesaid oil, and let them remain together for forty days. By this proportion of weight and this order the multiplication becomes infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-xiv:-concerning-the-secrets-and-arcana-of-antimony-for-the-red-tincture-with-a-view-to-transmutation.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER XIV: CONCERNING THE SECRETS AND ARCANA OF ANTIMONY, FOR THE RED TINCTURE, WITH A VIEW TO TRANSMUTATION. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xiv:-concerning-the-secrets-and-arcana-of-antimony-for-the-red-tincture-with-a-view-to-transmutation.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimony is the true bath of gold. Philosophers call it the examiner and the stilanx. Poets say that in this bath Vulcan washed Phoebus, and purified him from all dirt and imperfection. It is produced from the purest and noblest Mercury and Sulphur, under the genus of vitriol, in metallic form and brightness. Some philosophers call it the White Lead of the Wise Men, or simply the Lead. Take, therefore, of Antimony, the very best of its kind, as much as you will. Dissolve this in its own aquafortis, and throw it into cold water, adding a little of the crocus of Mars, so that it may sink to the bottom of the vessel as a sediment, for otherwise it does not throw off its dregs. After it has been dissolved in this way it will have acquired supreme beauty. Let it be placed in a glass vessel, closely fastened on all sides with a very thick lute, or else in a stone bocia, and mix with it some calcined tutia, sublimated to the perfect degree of fire. It must be carefully guarded from liquefying, because with too great heat it breaks the glass. From one pound of this Antimony a sublimation is made, perfected for a space of two days. Place this sublimated substance in a phial that it may touch the water with its third part, in a luted vessel, so that the spirit may not escape. Let it be suspended over the tripod of arcana, and let the work be urged on at first with a slow fire equal to the sun’s heat at midsummer. Then at length on the tenth day let it be gradually increased. For with too great heat the glass vessels are broken, and sometimes even the furnace goes to pieces. While the vapour is ascending different colours appear. Let the fire be moderated until a red matter is seen. Afterwards dissolve in very sharp Acetum, and throw away the dregs. Let the Acetum be abstracted and let it be again dissolved in common distilled water. This again must be abstracted, and the sediment distilled with a very strong fire in a glass vessel closely shut. The whole body of the Antimony will ascend as a very red oil, like the colour of a ruby, and will flow into the receiver, drop by drop, with a most fragrant smell and a very sweet taste[^39]. This is the supreme arcanum of the philosophers in Antimony, which they account most highly among the arcana of oils. Then, lastly, let the oil of Sol be made in the following way: – Take of the purest Sol as much as you will, and dissolve it in rectified spirit of wine. Let the spirit be abstracted several times, and an equal number of times let it be dissolved again. Let the last solution be kept with the spirit of wine, and circulated for a month. Afterwards let the volatile gold and the spirit of wine be distilled three or four times by means of an alembic, so that it may flow down into the receiver and be brought to its supreme essence. To half an ounce of this dissolved gold let one ounce of the Oil of Antimony be added. This oil embraces it in the heat of the bath, so that it does not easily let it go, even if the spirit of wine be extracted. In this way you will have the supreme mystery and arcanum of Nature, to which scarcely any equal can be assigned in the nature of things. Let these two oils in combination be shut up together in a phial after the manner described, hung on a tripod for a philosophical month, and warmed with a very gentle fire; although, if the fire be regulated in dire proportion this operation is concluded in thirty-one days, and brought to perfection. By this, Mercury and any other imperfect metals acquire the perfection of gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No precise weight can be assigned in this work of projection, though the tincture itself may be extracted from a certain subject, in a defined proportion, and with fitting appliances. For instance, that Medicine tinges sometimes thirty, forty, occasionally even sixty, eighty, or a hundred parts of the imperfect metal. So, then, the whole business hinges chiefly on the purification of the Medicine and the industry of the operator, and, next, on the greater; or lesser cleanliness and purity of the imperfect body taken in hand. For instance, one Venus is more pure than another; and hence it happens that no one fixed weight can be specified in projection. This alone is worth noting, that if the operator happens to have taken too much of the tincture, he can correct this mistake by adding more of the imperfect metal. But if there be too much of the subject, so that the powers of the tincture are weakened, this error is easily remedied by a cineritium, or by cementations, or by ablutions in crude Antimony. There is nothing at this stage which need delay the operator; only let him put before himself a fact which has been passed over by the philosophers, and by some studiously veiled, namely, that in projections there must be a revivification, that is to say, an animation of imperfect bodies – nay, so to speak, a spiritualisation; concerning which some have said that their metals are no common ones, since they live and have a soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;animation-is-produced-in-the-following-way.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;ANIMATION IS PRODUCED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#animation-is-produced-in-the-following-way.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take of Venus, wrought into small plates, as much as you will, ten, twenty, or forty pounds. Let these be incrusted with a pulse made of arsenic and calcined tartar, and calcined in their own vessel for twenty-four hours. Then at length let the Venus be pulverised, washed, and thoroughly purified. Let the calcination with ablution be repeated three or four times. In this way it is purged and purified from its thick greenness and from its own impure sulphur. You will have to be on your guard against calcinations made with common sulphur. For whatever is good in the metal is spoilt thereby, and what is bad becomes worse. To ten marks of this purged Venus add one of pure Luna. But in order that the work of the Medicine may be accelerated by projection, and may more easily penetrate the imperfect body, and drive out all portions which are opposed to the nature of Luna, this is accomplished by means of a perfect ferment. For the work is defiled by means of an impure Sulphur, so that a cloud is stretched out over the surface of the transmuted substance, or the metal is mixed with the loppings of the Sulphur and may be cast away therewith. But if a projection of a red stone is to be made, with a view to a red transmutation, it must first fall on gold, afterwards on silver, or on some other metal thoroughly purified, as we have directed above. From thence arises the most perfect gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-xvi:-concerning-the-universal-matter-of-the-philosophers&#39;-stone.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER XVI: CONCERNING THE UNIVERSAL MATTER OF THE PHILOSOPHERS’ STONE. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xvi:-concerning-the-universal-matter-of-the-philosophers&#39;-stone.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the mortification of vegetables, they are transmuted, by the concurrence of two minerals, such as Sulphur and Salt, into a mineral nature, so that at length they themselves become perfect minerals. So it is that in the mineral burrows and caves of the earth, vegetables are found which, in the long succession of time, and by the continuous heat of sulphur, put off the vegetable nature and assume that of the mineral. This happens, for the most part, where the appropriate nutriment is taken away from vegetables of this kind, so that they are afterwards compelled to derive their nourishment from the sulphur and salts of the earth, until what was before vegetable passes over into a perfect mineral. From this mineral state, too, sometimes a perfect metallic essence arises, and this happens by the progress of one degree into another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let us return to the Philosophers’ Stone. The matter of this, as certain writers have mentioned, is above all else difficult to discover and abstruse to understand. The method and most certain rule for finding out this, as well as other subjects – what they embrace or are able to effect – is a careful examination of the root and seed by which they come to our knowledge. For this, before all things else, a consideration of principles is absolutely necessary; and also of the manner in which Nature proceeds from imperfection to the end of perfection. Now, for this consideration it is well to have it thoroughly understood from the first that all things created by Nature consist of three primal elements, namely, natural Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt in combination, so that in some substances they are volatile, in others fixed. Wherever corporal Salt is mixed with spiritual Mercury and animated Sulphur into one body, then Nature begins to work, in those subterranean places which serve for her vessels, by means of a separating fire. By this the thick and impure Sulphur is separated from the pure, the earth is segregated from the Salt, and the clouds from the Mercury, while those purer parts are preserved, which Nature again welds together into a pure geogamic body. This operation is esteemed by the Magi as a mixture and conjunction by the uniting of three constituents, body, soul, and spirit. When this union is completed there results from it a pure Mercury. Now if this, when flowing down through its subterranean passages and veins, meets with a chaotic Sulphur, the Mercury is coagulated by it according to the condition of the Sulphur. It is, however, still volatile, so that scarcely in a hundred years is it transformed into a metal. Hence arose the vulgar idea that Mercury and Sulphur are the matter of the metals, as is certainly reported by miners. It is not, however, common Mercury and common Sulphur which are the matter of the metals, but the Mercury and the Sulphur of the philosophers are incorporated and inborn in perfect metals, and in the forms of them, so that they never fly from the fire, nor are they depraved by the force of the corruption caused by the elements. It is true that by the dissolution of this natural mixture our Mercury is subdued, as all the philosophers say. Under this form of words our Mercury comes to be drawn from perfect bodies and from the forces of the earthly planets. This is what Hermes asserts in the following terms: &amp;quot;The Sun and the Moon are the roots of this Art&amp;quot;. The Son of Hamuel says that the Stone of the philosophers is water coagulated, namely, in Sol and Luna. From this it is clearer than the sun that the material of the Stone is nothing else but Sol and Luna. This is confirmed by the fact that like produces like. We know that there are only two Stones, the white and the red. There are also two matters of the Stone, Sol and Luna, formed together in a proper marriage, both natural and artificial. Now, as we see that the man or the woman, without the seed of both, cannot generate, in the same way our man, Sol, and his wife, Luna, cannot conceive or do an thing in the way of generation, without the seed and sperm of both. Hence the philosophers gathered that a third thing was necessary, namely, the animated seed of both, the man and the woman, without which they judged that the whole of their work was fruitless and in vain. Such a sperm is Mercury, which, by the natural conjunction of both bodies Sol and Luna, receives their nature into itself in union. Then at length, and not before, the work is fit for congress, ingress, and generation; by the masculine and feminine power and virtue. Hence the philosophers have said that this same Mercury is composed of body, spirit, and soul, and that it has assumed the nature and property of all elements. Therefore, with their most powerful genius and intellect, they asserted their Stone to be animal. They even called it their Adam, who carries his own invisible Eve hidden in his body, from that moment in which they were united by the power of the Supreme God, the Maker of all creatures. For this reason it may be said that the Mercury of the Philosophers is none other than their most abstruse, compounded Mercury, and not the common Mercury. So then they have wisely said to the sages that there is in Mercury whatever wise men seek. Almadir, the philosopher, says: &amp;quot;We extract our Mercury from one perfect body and two perfect natural conditions incorporated together, which indeed puts forth externally its perfection, whereby it is able to resist the fire, so that its internal imperfection may be protected by the external perfections&amp;quot;. By this passage of the sagacious philosopher is understood the Adamic matter, the limbus of the microcosm[^40], and the homogeneous, unique matter of the philosophers. The sayings of these men, which we have before mentioned, are simply golden, and ever to be held in the highest esteem, because they contain nothing superfluous or without force. Summarily, then, the matter of the Philosophers’ Stone is none other than a fiery and perfect Mercury extracted by Nature and Art; that is, the artificially prepared and true hermaphrodite Adam, and the microcosm: That wisest of the philosophers, Mercurius, making the same statement, called the Stone an orphan. Our Mercury, therefore, is the same which contains in itself all the perfections, force, and virtues of the Sun, which also runs through all the streets and houses of all the planets, and in its own rebirth has acquired the force of things above and things below; to the marriage of which it is to be compared, as is clear from the whiteness and the redness combined in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-xvii:-concernlng-the-preparation-of-the-matter-for-the-philosophic-stone.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER XVII: CONCERNlNG THE PREPARATION OF THE MATTER FOR THE PHILOSOPHIC STONE. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xvii:-concernlng-the-preparation-of-the-matter-for-the-philosophic-stone.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Nature principally requires is that its own philosophic man should be brought into a mercurial substance, so that it may be born into the philosophic Stone. Moreover, it should be remarked that those common preparations of Geber, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Rupescissa, Polydorus, and such men, are nothing more than some particular solutions, sublimations, and calcinations, having no reference to our universal substance, which needs only the most secret fire of the philosophers. Let the fire and Azoth therefore suffice for you. From the fact that the philosophers make mention of certain preparations, such as putrefaction, distillation, sublimation, calcination, coagulation, dealbation, rubification, ceration, fixation, and the like, you should understand that in their universal substance, Nature herself fulfils all the operations in the matter spoken of, and not the operator, only in a philosophical vessel, and with a similar fire, but not common fire. The white and the red spring from one root without any intermediary. It is dissolved by itself, it copulates by itself, grows white, grows red, is made crocus-coloured and black by itself, marries itself and conceives in itself. It is therefore to be decocted, to be baked, to be fused; it ascends, and it descends. All these operations are a single operation and produced by the fire alone. Still, some philosophers, nevertheless, have, by a highly graduated essence of wine, dissolved the body of Sol, and rendered it volatile, so that it should ascend through an alembic, thinking that this is the true volatile matter of the philosophers, though it is not so. And although it be no contemptible arcanum to reduce this perfect metallic body into a volatile, spiritual substance, yet they are wrong in their separation of the elements. This process of the monks, such as Lully, Richard of England, Rupescissa, and the rest, is erroneous. By this process they thought that they were going to separate gold after this fashion into a subtle, spiritual, and elementary power, each by itself, and afterwards by circulation and rectification to combine them again in one – but in vain. For although one element may, in a certain sense, be separated from another, yet, nevertheless, every element separated in this way can again be separated into another element, but these elements cannot afterwards by circulation in a pelican, or by distillation, be again brought back into one; but they always remain a certain volatile matter, and aurum potabile, as they themselves call it. The reason why they could not compass their intention is that Nature refuses to be in this way dragged asunder and separated by man’s disjunctions, as by earthly glasses and instruments. She alone knows her own operations and the weights of the elements, the separations, rectifications, and copulations of which she brings about without the aid of any operator or manual artifice, provided only the matter be contained in the secret fire and in its proper occult vessel. The separation of the elements, therefore, is impossible by man. It may appear to take place, but it is not true, whatever may be said by Raymond Lully, and of that famous English golden work which he is falsely supposed to have accomplished. Nature herself has within herself the proper separator, who again joins together what he has put asunder, without the aid of man. She knows best the proportion of every element, which man does not know, however miseading writers romance in their frivolous and false recipes about this volatile gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the opinion of the philosophers, that when they have put their matter into the more secret fire, and when with a moderated philosophical heat it is cherished on every side, beginning to pass into corruption, it grows black. This operation they term putrefaction, and they call the blackness by the name of the Crow’s Head. The ascent and descent thereof they term distillation, ascension, and descension. The exsiccation they call coagulation; and the dealbation they call calcination; while because it becomes fluid and soft in the heat they make mention of ceration. When it ceases to ascend and remains liquid at the bottom, they say fixation is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this manner it is the terms of philosophical operations are to bc understood, and not otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-xviii:-concerning-instruments-and-the-philosophic-vessel.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER XVIII: CONCERNING INSTRUMENTS AND THE PHILOSOPHIC VESSEL. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xviii:-concerning-instruments-and-the-philosophic-vessel.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sham philosophers have misunderstood the occult and secret philosophic vessel, and worse is that which is said by Aristoteles the Alchemist (not the famous Greek Academic Philosopher), giving it out that the matter is to be decocted in a triple vessel. Worst of all is that which is said by another, namely, that the matter in its first separation and first degree requires a metallic vessel; in its second degree of coagulation and dealbation of its earth a glass vessel; and in the third degree, for fixation, an earthen vessel. Nevertheless, hereby the philosophers understand one vessel alone in all the operations up to the perfection of the red stone. Since, then, our matter is our root for the white and the red, necessarily our vessel must be so fashioned that the matter in it may be governed by the heavenly bodies. For invisible celestial influences and the impressions of the stars are in the very first degree necessary for the work: Otherwise it would be impossible for the Oriental, Chaldean, and Egyptian stone to be realised. By this Anaxagoras knew the powers of the whole firmament, and foretold that a great stone would descend from heaven to earth, which actually happened after his death. To the Cabalists our vessel is perfectly well known, because it must be made according to a truly geometrical proportion and measure, and from a definite quadrature of the circle, so that the spirit and the soul of our matter, separated from their body, may be able to raise this vessel with themselves in proportion to the altitude of heaven. If the vessel be wider, narrower, higher, or lower than is fitting, and than the dominating operating spirit and soul desire, the heat of our secret philosophic fire (which is, indeed, very severe), will violently excite the matter and urge it on to excessive operation, so that the vessel is shivered into a thousand pieces, with imminent danger to the body and even the life of the operator. On the other hand, if it be of greater capacity than is required in due proportion for the heat to have effect on the matter, the work will be wasted and thrown away. So, then, our philosophic vessel must be made with the greatest care. What the material of the vessel should be is understood only by those who, in the first solution of our fixed and perfected matter have brought that matter to its own primal quintessence. Enough has been said on this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operator must also very accurately note what, in its first solution, the matter sends forth and rejects from itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method of describing the form of the vessel is difficult. It should be such as Nature requires, and it must be sought out and investigated from every possible source, so that, from the height of the philosophic heaven, elevated above the philosophic earth, it may be able to operate on the fruit of its own earthly body. It should have this form, too, in order that the separation and purification of the elements, when the fire drives one from the other, may be able to be accomplished, and that each may have power to occupy the place to which it adheres; and also that the sun and the other planets may exercise their operations around the elemental earth, while their course in their circuit is neither hindered nor agitated with too swift a motion. In all these particulars which have been mentioned it must have a proper proportion of rotundity and of height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instruments for the first purification of mineral bodies are fusing-vessels, bellows, tongs, capels, cupels, tests, cementatory vessels, cineritiums, cucurbites, bocias for aquafortis and aqua regia; and also the appliances which are required for projection at the climax of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a well-known sententious saying of the philosophers, &amp;quot;Let fire and Azoc suffice thee&amp;quot;. Fire alone is the whole work and the entire art. Moreover, they who build their fire and keep their vessel in that heat are in error. In vain some have attempted it with the heat of horse dung. By the coal fire, without a medium, they have sublimated their matter, but they have not dissolved it. Others have got their heat from lamps, asserting that this is the secret fire of the philosophers for making their Stone. Some have placed it in a bath, first of all in heaps of ants’ eggs; others in juniper ashes. Some have sought the fire in quicklime, in tartar, vitriol, nitre, etc. Others, again, have sought it in boiling water. Thomas Aquinas speaks falsely of this fire, saying that God and the angels cannot do without this fire, but use it daily. What blasphemy is this! Is it not a manifest lie that God is not able to do without the elemental heat of boiling water? All the heats excited by those means which have been mentioned are utterly useless for our work Take care not to be misled by Arnold de Villa Nova, who has written on the subject of the coal fire, for in this matter he will deceive you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almadir says that the invisible rays of our fire of themselves suffice. Another cites, as an illustration, that the heavenly heat by its reflections tends to the coagulation and perfection of Mercury, just as by its continual motion it tends to the generation of metals. Again, says this same authority, &amp;quot;Make a fire, vaporous, digesting, as for cooking, continuous, but not volatile or boiling, enclosed, shut off from the air, not burning, but altering and penetrating. Now, in truth, I have mentioned every mode of fire and of exciting heat. If you are a true philosopher you will understand&amp;quot;. This is what he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salmanazar remarks: &amp;quot;Ours is a corrosive fire, which brings over our vessel an air like a cloud, in which cloud the rays of this fire are hidden. If this dew of chaos and this moisture of the cloud fail, a mistake has been committed&amp;quot;. Again, Almadir says, that unless the fire has warmed our sun with its moisture, by the excrement of the mountain, with a moderate ascent, we shall not be partakers either of the Red or the White Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these matters shew quite openly to us the occult fire of the wise men. Finally, this is the matter of our fire, namely, that it be kindled by the quiet spirit of sensible fire, which drives upwards, as it were, the heated chaos from the opposite quarter, and above our philosophic matter. This heat, glowing above our vessel, must urge it to the motion of a perfect generation, temperately but continuously, without intermission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-xx:-concerning-the-ferment-of-the-philosophers-and-the-weight.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER XX: CONCERNING THE FERMENT OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, AND THE WEIGHT. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/alchemy/#chapter-xx:-concerning-the-ferment-of-the-philosophers-and-the-weight.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophers have laboured greatly in the art of ferments and of fermentations, which seems important above all others. With reference thereto some have made a vow to God and to the philosophers that they would never divulge its arcanum by similitudes or by parables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Hermes, the father of all philosophers, in the &amp;quot;Book of the Seven Treatises&amp;quot;, most clearly discloses the secret of ferments, saying that they consist only of their own paste; and more at length he says that the ferment whitens the confection, hinders combustion, altogether retards the flux of the tincture, consoles bodies, and amplifies unions. He says, also, that this is the key and the end of the work, concluding that the ferment is nothing but paste, as that of the sun is nothing but sun, and that of the moon nothing but moon. Others affirm that the ferment is the soul, and if this be not rightly prepared from the magistery, it effects nothing. Some zealots of this Art seek the Art in common sulphur, arsenic, tutia, auripigment, vitriol, etc., but in vain; since the substance which is sought is the same as that from which it has to be drawn forth. It should be remarked, therefore, that fermentations of this kind do not succeed according to the wishes of the zealots in the way they desire, but, as is clear from what has been said above, simply in the way of natural successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, to come at length to the weight; this must be noted in two ways. The first is natural, the second artificial. The natural attains its result in the earth by Nature and concordance. Of this, Arnold says: If more or less earth than Nature requires be added, the soul is suffocated, and no result is perceived, nor any fixation. It is the same with the water. If more or less of this bc taken it will bring a corresponding loss. A superfluity renders the matter unduly moist, and a deficiency makes it too dry and too hard. If there be over much air present, it is too strongly impressed on the tincture; if there be too little, the body will turn out pallid. In the same way, if the fire be too strong, the matter is burnt up; if it be too slack, it has not the power of drying, nor of dissolving or heating the other elements. In these things elemental heat consists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial weight is quite occult. It is comprised in the magical art of ponderations. Between the spirit, soul, and body, say the philosophers, weight consists of Sulphur as the director of the work; for the soul strongly desires Sulphur, and necessarily observes it by reason of its weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can understand it thus: Our matter is united to a red fixed Sulphur, to which a third part of the regimen has been entrusted, even to the ultimate degree, so that it may perfect to infinity the operation of the Stone, may remain therewith together with its fire, and may consist of a weight equal to the matter itself, in and through all, without variation of any degree. Therefore, after the matter has been adapted and mixed in its proportionate weight, it should be closely shut up with its seal in the vessel of the philosophers, and committed to the secret fire. In this the Philosophic Sun will rise and surge up, and will illuminate all things that have been looking for his light, expecting it with highest hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these few words we will conclude the arcanum of the Stone, an arcanum which is in no way maimed or defective, for which we give God undying thanks. Now have we opened to you our treasure, which is not to be paid for by the riches of the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the chief study of a Philosopher?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is the investigation of the operations of Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the end of Nature?&lt;br /&gt;
A. God, Who is also its beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Whence are all things derived?&lt;br /&gt;
A. From one and indivisible Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Into how many regions is Nature separated?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Into four palmary regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Which are they?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The dry, the moist, the warm, and the cold, which are the four elementary qualities, whence all things originate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is Nature differentiated?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Into male and female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. To what may we compare Nature?&lt;br /&gt;
A. To Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Give a concise definition of Nature.&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is not visible, though it operates visibly; for it is simply a volatile spirit, fulfilling its office in bodies, and animated by the universal spirit-the divine breath, the central and universal fire, which vivifies all things that exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What should be the qualities possessed by the examiners of Nature?&lt;br /&gt;
A. They should be like unto Nature herself. That is to say, they should be truthful, simple, patient, and persevering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What matters should subsequently engross their attention?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The philosophers should most carefully ascertain whether their designs are in harmony with Nature, and of a possible and attainable kind; if they would accomplish by their own power anything that is usually performed by the power of Nature, they must imitate her in every detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What method must be followed in order to produce something which shall be developed to a superior degree than Nature herself develops it.&lt;br /&gt;
A. The manner of its improvement must be studied, and this is invariably operated by means of a like nature. For example, if it be desired to develop the intrinsic virtue of a given metal beyond its natural condition, the chemist must avail himself of the metallic nature itself, and must be able to discriminate between its male and female differentiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Where does the metallic nature store her seeds?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In the four elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. With what materials can the philosopher alone accomplish anything?&lt;br /&gt;
A. With the germ of the given matter; this is its elixir or quintessence, more precious by far, and more useful, to the artist, than is Nature herself. Before the philosopher has extracted the seed, or germ, Nature, in his behalf, will be ready to perform her duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the germ, or seed, of any substance?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is the most subtle and perfect decoction and digestion of the substance itself; or, rather, it is the Balm of Sulphur, which is identical with the Radical Moisture of Metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. By what is this seed, or germ, engendered?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By the four elements, subject to the will of the Supreme Being, and through the direct intervention of the imagination of Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. After what manner do the four elements operate?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By means of an incessant and uniform motion, each one, according to its quality, depositing its seed in the centre of the earth, where it is subjected to action and digested, and is subsequently expelled in an outward direction by the laws of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What do the philosophers understand by the centre of the earth?&lt;br /&gt;
A. A certain void place where nothing may repose, and the existence of which is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Where, then, do the four elements expel and deposit their seeds?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In the ex-centre, or in the margin and circumference of the centre, which, after it has appropriated a portion, casts out the surplus into the region of excrement, scoriae, fire, and formless chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Illustrate this teaching by an example.&lt;br /&gt;
A. Take any level table, and set in its centre a vase filled with water; surround the vase with several things of various colours, especially salt, taking care that a proper distance intervenes between them all. Then pour out the water from the vase, and it will flow in streams here and there; one will encounter a substance of a red colour, and will assume a tinge of red; another will pass over the salt, and will contract a saline flavour; for it is certain that water does not modify the places which it traverses, but the diverse characteristics of places change the nature of water. In the same way the seed which is deposited by the four elements at the centre of the earth is subject to a variety of modifications in the places through which it passes, so that every existing substance is produced in the likeness of its channel, and when a seed on its arrival at a certain point encounters pure earth and pure water, a pure substance results, but the contrary in an opposite case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. After what manner do the elements procreate this seed?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In order to the complete elucidation of this point, it must be observed that there are two gross and heavy elements and two that are volatile in character. Two, in like manner, are dry and two humid, one out of the four being actually excessively dry, and the other excessively moist. They are also masculine and feminine. Now, each of them has a marked tendency to reproduce its own species within its own sphere. Moreover, they are never in repose, but are perpetually interacting, and each of them separates, of and by itself, the most subtle portion thereof. Their general place of meeting is in the centre, even the centre of the Archeus, that servant of Nature, where coming to mix their several seeds, they agitate and finally expel them to the exterior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the true and the first matter of all metals?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The first matter, properly so called, is dual in its essence, or is in itself of a twofold nature; one, nevertheless, cannot create a metal without the concurrence of the other. The first and the palmary essence is an aerial humidity, blended with a warm air, in the form of a fatty water, which adheres to all substances indiscriminately, whether they are pure or impure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How has this humidity been named by Philosophers?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. By what is it governed?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By the rays of the Sun and Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the second matter?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The warmth of the earth -otherwise, that dry heat which is termed Sulphur by the Philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Can the entire material body be converted into seed?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Its eight-hundredth part only-that, namely, which is secreted in the centre of the body in question, and may, for example, be seen in a grain of wheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Of what use is the bulk of the matter as regards its seed?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is useful as a safeguard against excessive heat, cold, moisture, or aridity, and, in general, all hurtful inclemency, against which it acts as an envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Would those artists who pretend to reduce the whole matter of any body into seed derive any advantage from the process, supposing it were possible to perform it?&lt;br /&gt;
A. None; on the contrary, their labour would be wholly unproductive, because nothing that is good can be accomplished by a deviation from natural methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What, therefore, should be done?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The matter must be effectively separated from its impurities, for there is no metal, how pure soever, which is entirely free from imperfections, though their extent varies. Now all superfluities, cortices, and scoriae must be peeled off and purged out from the matter in order to discover its seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What should receive the most careful attention of the Philosopher?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Assuredly, the end of Nature, and this is by no means to be looked for in the vulgar metals, because, these having issued already from the hands of the fashioner, it is no longer to be found therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. For what precise reason?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Because the vulgar metals, and chiefly gold, are absolutely dead, while ours, on the contrary, are absolutely living, and possess a soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the life of metals?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is no other substance than fire, when they are as yet imbedded in the mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is their death?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Their life and death are in reality one principle, for they die, as they live, by fire, but their death is from a fire of fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. After what manner are metals conceived in the womb of the earth?&lt;br /&gt;
A. When the four elements have developed their power or virtue in the centre of the earth, and have deposited their seed, the Archeus of Nature, in the course of a distillatory process, sublimes them superficially by the warmth and energy of the perpetual movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Into what does the wind resolve itself when it is distilled through the pores of the earth?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It resolves itself into water, whence all things spring; in this state it is merely a humid vapour, out of which there is subsequently evolved the principiated principle of all substances, which also serves as the first matter of the Philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What then is this principiated principle, which is made use of as the first matter by the Children of Knowledge in the philosophic achievement?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is this identical matter, which, the moment it is conceived, receives a permanent and unchangeable form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, the Sun, the Moon, etc., separately endowed with individual seed?&lt;br /&gt;
A. One is common to them all; their differences are to be accounted for by the: locality from which they are derived, not to speak of the fact that Nature completes her work with far greater rapidity in the procreation of silver than in that of gold, and so of the other metals, each in its own proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is gold formed in the bowels of the earth?&lt;br /&gt;
A. When this vapour, of which we have spoken, is sublimed in the centre of the earth, and when it has passed through warm and pure places, where a certain sulphureous grease adheres to the channels, then this vapour, which the Philosophers have denominated their Mercury, becomes adapted and joined to this grease, which it sublimes with itself; from such amalgamation there is produced a certain unctuousness, which, abandoning the vaporous form, assumes that of grease, and is sublimised in other places, which have been cleansed by this preceding vapour, and the earth whereof has consequently been rendered more subtle, pure, and humid; it fills the pores of this earth, is joined thereto, and gold is produced as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is Saturn engendered?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It occurs when the said unctuosity, or grease, passes through places which are totally impure and cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is Venus brought forth?&lt;br /&gt;
A. She is produced in localities where the earth itself is pure, but is mingled with impure sulphur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What power does the vapour, which we have recently mentioned, possess in the centre of the earth?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By its continual progress it has the power of perpetually rarefying whatsoever is crude and impure, and of successively attracting to itself all that is pure around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the seed of the first matter of all things?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The first matter of things, that is to say, the matter of principiating principles is begotten by Nature, without the assistance of any other seed; in other words, Nature receives the matter from the elements, whence it subsequently brings forth the seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What, absolutely speaking, is therefore the seed of things?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The seed in a body is no other thing than a congealed air, or a humid vapour, which is useless except it be dissolved by a warm vapour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is the generation of seed comprised in the metallic kingdom?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By the artifice of Archeus the four elements, in the first generation of Nature, distil a ponderous vapour of water into the centre of the earth ; this is the seed of metals, and it is called Mercury, not on account of its essence, but because of its fluidity, and the facility with which it will adhere to each and every thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Why is this vapour compared to sulphur?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Because of its internal heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. From what species of Mercury are we to conclude that the metals are composed?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The reference is exclusively to the Mercury of the Philosophers, and in no sense to the common or vulgar substance, which cannot become a seed, seeing that, like other metals, it already contains its own seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What, therefore, must actually be accepted as the subject of our matter?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The seed alone, otherwise the fixed grain, and not the whole body, which is differentiated into Sulphur, or living male, and into Mercury, or living female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What operation must be afterwards performed&lt;br /&gt;
A. They must be joined together, so that they may form a germ, after which they will proceed to the procreation of a fruit which is conformed to their nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the part of the artist in this operation?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The artist must do nothing but separate that which is subtle from that which is gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. To what, therefore, is the whole philosophic combination reduced?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The development of one into two, and the reduction of two into one, and nothing further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Whither must we turn for the seed and life of meals and minerals?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The seed of minerals is properly the water which exists in the centre&lt;br /&gt;
And the heart of the minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How does Nature operate by the help of Art?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Every seed, whatsoever its kind, is useless, unless by Nature or Art it is placed in a suitable matrix, where it receives its life by the coction of the germ! and by the congelation of the pure particle, or fixed grain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is the seed subsequently nourished and preserved?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By the warmth of its body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is therefore performed by the artist in the mineral kingdom?&lt;br /&gt;
A. He finishes what cannot be finished by Nature on account of the crudity of the air, which has permeated the pores of all bodies by its violence, but on the surface and not in the bowels of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What correspondence have the metals among themselves?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is necessary for a proper comprehension of the nature of this correspondence to consider the position of the planets, and to pay attention to Saturn, which is the highest of all, and then is succeeded by Jupiter, next by Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and, lastly, by the Moon. It must be observed that the influential virtues of the planets do not ascend but descend, and experience teaches us that Mars can be easily converted into Venus, not Venus into Mars, which is of a lower sphere. So, also, Jupiter can be easily transmuted into Mercury, because Jupiter is superior to Mercury, the one being second after the firmament, the other second above the earth, and Saturn is highest of all, while the Moon is lowest. The Sun enters into all, but it is never ameliorated by its inferiors. It is clear that there is a large correspondence between Saturn and the Moon, in the middle of which is the Sun; but to all these changes the Philosopher should strive to administer the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the object of research among the Philosophers?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Proficiency in the art of perfecting what Nature has left imperfect in the mineral kingdom, and the attainment of the treasure of the Philosophical Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is this Stone?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The Stone is nothing else than the radical humidity of the elements, perfectly purified and educed into a sovereign fixation, which causes it to perform such great things for health, life being resident exclusively in the humid radical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. In what does the secret of accomplishing this admirable work consist?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It consists in knowing how to educe from potentiality into activity the innate warmth, or the fire of Nature, which is enclosed in the centre of the radical humidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What are the precautions which must be made use of to guard against failure in the work?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Great pains must be taken to eliminate excrements from the matter, and to conserve nothing but the kernel, which contains all the virtue of the compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Why does this medicine heal every species of disease?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is not on account of tile variety of its qualities, but simply because it powerfully fortifies the natural warmth, which it gently stimulates, while other physics irritate it by too violent an action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q How can you demonstrate to me the truth of the art in the matter of the tincture?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Firstly, its truth is founded on the fact that the physical powder, being composed of the same substance as the metals, namely, quicksilver, has the faculty of combining with these in fusion, one nature easily embracing another which is like itself. Secondly, seeing that the imperfection of the base metals is owing to the crudeness of their quicksilver, and to that alone, the physical powder, which is a ripe and decocted quicksilver, and, in itself a pure fire, can easily communicate to them its own maturity, and can transmute them into its nature, after it has attracted their crude humidity, that is to say, their quicksilver, which is the sole substance that transmutes them, the rest being nothing but scoriae and excrements, which are rejected in projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What road should the Philosopher follow that he may attain to the knowledge and execution of the physical work?&lt;br /&gt;
A. That precisely which was followed by the Great Architect of the Universe in the creation of the world, by observing how the chaos was evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What was the matter of the chaos?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It could be nothing else than a humid vapour, because water alone enters into all created substances, which all finish in a strange term, this term being a proper subject for the impression of all forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Give me an example to illustrate what you have just stated.&lt;br /&gt;
A. An example may be found in the special productions of composite substances, the seeds of which invariably begin by resolving themselves into a certain humour, which is the chaos of the particular matter, whence issues, by a kind of irradiation, the complete form of the plant. Moreover, it should be observed that Holy Scripture makes no mention of anything except water as the material subject whereupon the Spirit of God brooded, nor of anything except light as the universal form of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What profit may the Philosopher derive from these considerations, and what should he especially remark in the method of creation which was pursued by the Supreme Being?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In the first place he should observe the matter out of which the world was made; he will see that out of this confused mass, the Sovereign Artist began by extracting light, that this light in the same moment dissolved the darkness which covered the face of the earth, and that it served as the universal form of the matter. He will then easily perceive that in the generation of all composite substances, a species of irradiation takes place, and a separation of light and darkness, wherein Nature is an undeviating copyist of her Creator. The Philosopher will equally understand after what manner, by the action of this light, the empyrean, or firmament which divides the superior and inferior waters, was subsequently produced; how the sky was studded with luminous bodies; and how the necessity for the moon arose, which was owing to the space intervening between the things above and the things below; for the moon is an intermediate torch between the superior and the inferior worlds, receiving the celestial influences and communicating them to the earth. Finally he will understand how the Creator, in the gathering of the waters, produced dry land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How many heavens can you enumerate?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Properly there is one only, which is the firmament that divides the waters from the waters. Nevertheless, three are admitted, of which the first is the space that is above the clouds. In this heaven the waters are rarefied, and fall upon the fixed stars, and it is also in this space that the planets and wandering stars perform their revolutions. The second heaven is the firmament of the fixed stars, while the third is the abode of the supercelestial waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Why is the rarefaction of the waters confined to the first heaven?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Because it is in the nature of rarefied substances to ascend, and because God, in His eternal laws, has assigned its proper sphere to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Why does each celestial body invariably revolve about an axis?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is by reason of the primeval impetus which it received, and by virtue of the same law which will cause any heavy substance suspended from a thread to turn with the same velocity, if the power which impels its motion be always equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Why do the superior waters never descend?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Because of their extreme rarefaction. It is for this reason that a skilled chemist can derive more profit from the study of rarefaction than from any other science whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the matter of the firmament?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is properly air, which is more suitable than water as a medium of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. After the separation of the waters from the dry earth, what was performed by the Creator to originate generation?&lt;br /&gt;
A. He created a certain light which was destined for this office; He placed it in the central fire, and moderated this fire by the humidity of water and by the coldness of earth, so as to keep a check upon its energy and adapt it to His design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the action of this central fire?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It continually operates upon the nearest humid matter, which it exalts into vapour; now this vapour is the mercury of Nature and the first matter of the three kingdoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is the sulphur of Nature subsequently formed?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By the interaction of the central fire and the mercurial vapour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is the salt of the sea produced?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By the action of the same fire upon aqueous humidity, when the aerial humidity, which is contained therein, has been exhaled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What should be done by a truly wise Philosopher when he has once mastered the foundation and the order in the procedure of the Great Architect of the Universe in the construction of all that exists in Nature?&lt;br /&gt;
A. He should, as far as may be possible, become a faithful copyist of his Creator. In the physical chaos he should make his chaos such as the original actually was; he should separate the light from the darkness : he should form his firmament for the separation of the waters which are above from the waters which are below, and should successively accomplish, point by point, the entire sequence of the creative act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. With what is this grand and sublime operation performed?&lt;br /&gt;
A. With one single corpuscle, or minute body, which, so to speak, contains nothing but faeces, filth, and abominations, but whence a certain tenebrous and mercurial humidity is extracted, which contains in itself all that is required by the Philosopher, because, as a fact, he is in search of nothing hut the true Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What kind of mercury, therefore, must he make use of in performing the work? A. Of a mercury which, as such, is not found on the earth, but is extracted from bodies, yet not from vulgar mercury, as it has been falsely said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Why is the latter unfitted to the needs of our work?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Because the wise artist must take notice that vulgar mercury has an insufficient quantity of sulphur, and he should consequently operate upon a body created by Nature, in which Nature herself has united the sulphur and mercury that it is the work of the artist to separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What must he subsequently do?&lt;br /&gt;
A. He must purify them and join them anew together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How do you denominate the body of which we have been speaking?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The RUDE STONE, Or Chaos, or Iliaste, or Hyle--that confused mass which is known but universally despised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. As you have told me that Mercury is the one thing which the Philosopher must absolutely understand, will you give me a circumstantial description of it, so as to avoid misconception?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In respect of its nature, our Mercury is dual--fixed and volatile; in regard to its motion, it is also dual, for it has a motion of ascent and of descent; by that of descent, it is the influence of plants, by which it stimulates the drooping fire of Nature, and this is its first office previous to congelation. By its ascensional movement, it rises, seeking to be purified, and as this is after congelation, it is considered to be the radical moisture of substances, which, beneath its vile scoriae, still preserves the nobility of its first origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How many species of moisture do you suppose to be in each composite thing?&lt;br /&gt;
A. There are three--the Elementary, which is properly the vase of the other elements; the Radical, which, accurately speaking, is the oil, or balm, in which the entire virtue of the subject is resident--lastly, the Alimentary, the true natural dissolvent, which draws up the drooping internal fire, causing corruption and blackness by its humidity, and fostering and sustaining the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How many species of Mercury are there known to the Philosophers?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The Mercury of the Philosophers may be regarded under four aspects; the first is entitled the Mercury of bodies, which is actually their concealed seed; the second is the Mercury of Nature, which is the Bath or Vase of the Philosophers, otherwise the humid radical; to the third has been applied the designation, Mercury of the Philosophers, because it is found in their laboratory and in their minera. It is the sphere of Saturn; it is the Diana of the Wise; it is the true salt of metals, after the acquisition of which the true philosophic work may be truly said to have begun. In its fourth aspect, it is called Common Mercury, which yet is not that of the Vulgar, but rather is properly the true air of the Philosophers, the true middle substance of water, the true secret and concealed fire, called also common fire, because it is common to all minerae, for it is the substance of metals, and thence do they derive their quantity and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How many operations art comprised in our work?&lt;br /&gt;
A. There is one only, which may be resolved into sublimation, and sublimation, according to Geber, is nothing other than the elevation of the dry matter by the mediation of fire, with adherence to its own vase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What precaution should be taken in reading the Hermetic Philosophers ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Great care, above all, must be observed upon this point, lest what they say upon the subject should be interpreted literally and in accordance with the mere sound of the words: For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What books should be read in order to have an acquaintance with our science?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Among the ancients, all the works of Hermes should especially be studied; in the next place, a certain book, entitled The Passage of the Red Sea, and another, The Entrance into the Promised Land. Paracelsus also should be read before all among elder writers, and, among other treatises, his Chemical Pathway, or the Manual of Paracelsus, which contains all the mysteries of demonstrative physics and the most arcane Kabbalah. This rare and unique manuscript work exists only in the Vatican Library, but Sendivogius had the good fortune to take a copy of it, which has helped in the illumination of the sages of our order. Secondly, Raymond Lully must be read, and his Vade Mecum above all, his dialogue called the Tree of Life, his testament, and his codicil. There must, however, be a certain precaution exercised in respect to the two last, because, like those of Geber, and also of Arnold de Villanova, they abound in false recipes and futile fictions, which seem to have been inserted with the object of more effectually disguising the truth from the ignorant. In the third place, the Turba Philosophorum which is a collection of ancient authors, contains much that is materially good, though there is much also which is valueless. Among mediaeval writers Zachary, Trevisan, Roger Bacon, and a certain anonymous author, whose book is entitled The Philosophers, should be held especially high in the estimation of the student. Among moderns the most worthy to be prized are John Fabricius, Francois de Nation, and Jean D&#39;Espagnet, who wrote Physics Restored, though, to say the truth, he has imported some false precepts and fallacious opinions into his treatise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. When may the Philosopher venture to undertake the work?&lt;br /&gt;
A. When he is, theoretically, able to extract, by means of a crude spirit, a digested spirit out of a body in dissolution, which digested spirit he must again rejoin to the vital oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Explain me this theory in a clearer manner.&lt;br /&gt;
A. It may be demonstrated more completely in the actual process; the great experiment may be undertaken when the Philosopher, by the medium of a vegetable menstruurn, united to a mineral menstruum, is qualified to dissolve a third essential menstruum, with which menstruums united he must wash the earth, and then exalt it into a celestial quintessence, to compose the sulphureous thunderbolt, which instantaneously penetrates substances and destroys their excrements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Have those persons a proper acquaintance with Nature who pretend to make use of vulgar gold for seed, and of vulgar mercury for the dissolvent, or the earth in which it should be sown?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Assuredly not, because neither the one nor the other possesses the external agent--gold, because it has been deprived of it by decoction, and mercury because it has never had it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. In seeking this auriferous seed elsewhere than in gold itself, is there no danger of producing a species of monster, since one appears to be departing from Nature?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is undoubtedly true that in gold is contained the auriferous seed, and that in a more perfect condition than it is found in any other body; but this does not force us to make use of vulgar gold, for such a seed is equally found in each of the other metals, and is nothing else but that fixed grain which Nature has infused in the first congelation of mercury, all metals having one origin and a common substance, as will be ultimately unveiled to those who become worthy of receiving it by application and assiduous study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What follows from this doctrine?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It follows that, although the seed is more perfect in gold, it may be extracted much more easily from another body than from gold itself, other bodies being more open, that is to say, less digested, and less restricted in their humidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Give me an example taken from Nature.&lt;br /&gt;
A. Vulgar gold may be likened to a fruit which, having come to a perfect maturity, has been cut off from its tree, and though it contains a most perfect and well-digested seed, notwithstanding, should anyone set it in the ground, with a view to its multiplication, much time, trouble, and attention will be consumed in the development of its vegetative capabilities. On the other hand, if a cutting, or a root, be taken from the same tree, and similarly planted, in a short time, and with no trouble, it will spring up and produce much fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Is it necessary that an amateur of this science should understand the formation of metals in the bowels of the earth if he wishes to complete his work ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. So indispensable is such a knowledge that should anyone fail, before all other studies, to apply himself to its attainment, and to imitate Nature point by point therein, he will never succeed in accomplishing anything but what is worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How, then, does Nature deposit metals in the bowels of the earth, and of what does she compose them ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Nature manufactures them all out of sulphur and mercury, and forms them by their double vapour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What do you mean by this double vapour, and how can metals be formed thereby?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In order to a complete understanding of this question, it must first be stated that mercurial vapour is united to sulphureous vapour in a cavernous place which contains a saline water, which serves as their matrix. Thus is formed, firstly, the Vitriol of Nature; secondly, by the commotion of the elements, there is developed out of this Vitriol of Nature a new vapour, which is neither mercurial nor sulphureous, yet is allied to both these natures, and this, passing through places to which the grease of sulphur adheres, is joined therewith, and out of their union a glutinous substance is produced, otherwise, a formless mass, which is permeated by the vapour that fills these cavernous places. By this vapour, acting through the sulphur it contains, are produced the perfect metals, provided that the vapour and the locality are pure. If the locality and the vapour are impure, imperfect metals result. The terms perfection and imperfection have reference to various degrees of concoction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is contained in this vapour?&lt;br /&gt;
A. A spirit of light and a spirit of fire, of the nature of the celestial bodies, which properly should be considered as the form of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What does this vapour represent?&lt;br /&gt;
A. This vapour, thus impregnated by the universal spirit, represents, in a fairly complete way, the original Chaos, which contained all that was required for the original creation, that is, universal matter and universal form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. And one cannot, notwithstanding, make use of vulgar mercury in the process?&lt;br /&gt;
A. No, because vulgar mercury, as already made plain, is devoid of external agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Whence comes it that common mercury is without its external agent?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Because in the exaltation of the double vapour, the commotion has been so great and searching, that the spirit, or agent, has evaporated, as occurs, with very close similarity, in the fusion of metals. The result is that the unique mercurial part is deprived of its masculine or sulphureous agent, and consequently can never be transmuted into gold by Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How many species of gold are distinguished by the Philosophers?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Three sorts :--Astral Gold, Elementary Gold, and Vulgar Gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is astral gold?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Astral Gold has its centre in the sun, which communicates it by its rays to all inferior beings. It is an igneous substance, which receives a continual emanation of solar corpuscles that penetrate all things sentient, vegetable, and mineral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What do you refer to under the term Elementary Gold ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. This is the most pure and fixed portion of the elements, and of all that is composed of them. All sublunary beings included in the three kingdoms contain in their inmost centre a precious grain of this elementary gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Give me some description of Vulgar Gold ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is the most beautiful metal of our acquaintance, the best that Nature can produce, as perfect as it is unalterable in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Of what species of gold is the Stone of the Philosophers ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is of the second species, as being the most pure portion of all the metallic elements after its purification, when it is termed living philosophical gold. A perfect equilibrium and equality of the four elements enter into the Physical Stone, and four things are indispensable for the accomplishment of the work, namely, composition, allocation, mixture, and union, which, once performed according to the rules of art, will beget the lawful Son of the Sun, and the Phoenix which eternally rises out of its own ashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is actually the living gold of the Philosophers?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is exclusively the fire of Mercury, or that igneous virtue, contained in the radical moisture, to which it has already communicated the fixity and the nature of the sulphur, whence it has emanated, the mercurial character of the whole substance of philosophical sulphur permitting it to be alternatively termed mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What other name is also given by the Philosophers to their living gold ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. They also term it their living sulphur, and their true fire; they recognize its existence in all bodies, and there is nothing that can subsist without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Where must we look for our living gold, our living sulphur, and our true fire ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In the house of Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. By what is this fire nourished?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Give me a comparative illustration of the power of this fire ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. To exemplify the attraction of this interior fire, there is no better comparison than that which is derived from the thunderbolt, which originally is simply a dry, terrestrial exhalation, united to a humid vapour. By exaltation, and by assuming the igneous nature, it acts on the humidity which is inherent to it; this it attracts to itself, transmutes it into its own nature, and then rapidly precipitates itself to the earth, where it is attracted by a fixed nature which is like unto its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What should be done by the Philosopher after he has extracted his Mercury ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. He should develop it from potentiality into activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Cannot Nature perform this of herself?&lt;br /&gt;
A. No; because she stops short after the first sublimation, and out of the matter which is thus disposed do the metals engender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What do the Philosophers understand by their gold and silver?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The Philosophers apply to their Sulphur the name of Gold, and to their Mercury the name of Silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Whence are they derived?&lt;br /&gt;
A. I have already stated that they are derived from a homogeneous body wherein they are found in great abundance, whence also Philosophers know how to extract both by an admirable, and entirely philosophical, process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. When this operation has been duly performed, to what other point of the practice must they next apply themselves?&lt;br /&gt;
A. To the confection of the philosophical amalgam, which must be done with great care, but can only be accomplished after the preparation and sublimation of the Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. When should your matter be combined with the living gold?&lt;br /&gt;
A. During the period of amalgamation only, that is to say, Sulphur is introduced into it by means of the amalgamation, and thenceforth there is one substance; the process is shortened by the addition of Sulphur, while the tincture at the same time is augmented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is contained in the centre of the radical moisture ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It contains and conceals Sulphur, which is covered with a hard rind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What must be done to apply it to the Great Work?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It must be drawn, out of its bonds with consummate skill, and by the method of putrefaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Does Nature, in her work in the mines, possess a menstruum which is adapted to the dissolution and liberation of this sulphur?&lt;br /&gt;
A. No; because there is no local movement. Could Nature, unassisted, dissolve, putrefy, and purify the metallic body, she would herself provide us with !he Physical Stone, which is Sulphur exalted and increased in virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Can you elucidate this doctrine by an example?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By an enlargement of the previous comparison of a fruit, or a seed, which, in the first place, is put into the earth for its solution, and afterwards for its multiplication. Now, the Philosopher, who is in a position to discern what is good seed, extracts it from its centre, consigns it to its proper earth, when it has been well cured and prepared, and therein he rarefies it in such a manner that its prolific virtue is increased and indefinitely multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. In what does the whole secret of the seed consist ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In the true knowledge of its proper earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What do you understand by the seed in the work Of the Philosophers ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. I understand the interior heat, or the specific spirit, which is enclosed in the humid radical, which, in other words, is the middle substance of living silver, the proper sperm of metals, which contains its own seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How do you set free the sulphur from its bonds?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By putrefaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the earth of minerals ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is their proper menstruum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What pains must be taken by the Philosopher to extract that part which he requires?&lt;br /&gt;
A. He must take great pains to eliminate the fetid vapours and impure sulphurs, after which the seed must be injected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. By what indication may the Artist be assured that he is in the right road at the beginning of his work?&lt;br /&gt;
A. When he finds that the dissolvent and the thing dissolved are converted into one form and one matter at the period of dissolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How many solutions do you count in the Philosophic Work?&lt;br /&gt;
A. There are three. The first solution is that which reduces the crude and metallic body into its elements of sulphur and of living silver; the second is that of the physical body, and the third is the solution of the mineral earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is the metallic body reduced by the first solution into mercury, and then into sulphur?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By the secret artificial fire, which is the Burning Star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is this operation performed?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By extracting from the subject, in the first place, the mercury or vapour of the elements, and, after purification, by using it to liberate the sulphur from its bonds, by corruption, of which blackness is the indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is the second solution performed ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. When the physical body is resolved into the two substances previously mentioned, and has acquired the celestial nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the name which is applied by Philosophers to the Matter during this period?&lt;br /&gt;
A, It is called their Physical Chaos, and it is, in fact, the true First Matter, a name which can hardly be applied before the conjunction of the male--which is sulphur--with the female--which is silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. To what does the third solution refer?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is the humectation of the mineral earth and it is closely bound up with multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What fire must be made use of in our work ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. That fire which is used by Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the potency of this fire?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It dissolves everything that is in the world, because it is the principle of all dissolution and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Why is it also termed Mercury ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Because it is in its nature aerial, and a most subtle vapour, which partakes at the same time of sulphur, whence it has contracted some contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Where is this fire concealed ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is concealed in the subject of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Who is it that is familiar with, and can produce, this fire?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is known to the wise, who can both produce it and purify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the essential potency and characteristic of this fire ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is excessively dry, and is continually in motion; it seeks only to disintegrate and to educe things from potentiality into actuality; it is that, in a word, which coming upon solid places in mines, circulates in a vaporous form upon the matter, and dissolves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How may this fire be most easily distinguished?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By the sulphureous excrements in which it is enveloped, and by the saline environment with which it is clothed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What must be added to this fire so as to accentuate its capacity for incineration in the feminine species?&lt;br /&gt;
A. On account of its extreme dryness it requires to be moistened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How many philosophical fires do you enumerate ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. There are in all three--the natural, the unnatural, and the contra-natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Explain to me these three species of fires.&lt;br /&gt;
A. The natural fire is the masculine fire, or the chief agent; the unnatural is the feminine, which is the dissolvent of Nature, nourishing a white smoke, and assuming that form. This smoke is quickly dissipated, unless much care be exercised, and it is almost incombustible, though by philosophical sublimation it becomes corporeal and resplendent. The contra-natural fire is that which disintegrates compounds and has the power to unbind what has&#39; been bound very closely by Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Where is our matter to be found?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is to be found everywhere, but it must specially be sought in metallic nature, where it is more easily available than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What kind must be preferred before all others ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The most mature, the most appropriate, and the easiest; but care, before all things, must be taken that the metallic essence shall be present, not only potentially but in actuality, and that there is, moreover, a metallic splendour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Is everything contained in this subject?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Yes; but Nature, at the same time, must be assisted, so that the work may be perfected and hastened, and this by the means which are familiar to the higher grades of experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Is this subject exceedingly precious ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It is vile, and originally is without native elegance; should anyone say that it is saleable, it is the species to which they refer, but, fundamentally, it is not saleable, because it is useful in our work alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What does our Matter contain?&lt;br /&gt;
A. It contains Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What operation is it most important to be able to perform?&lt;br /&gt;
A. The successive extraction of the Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. How is that done ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. By sole and perfect sublimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is in the first place extracted ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Mercury in the form of a white smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What follows?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Igneous water, or Sulphur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What then?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Dissolution with purified salt, in the first place volatilising that which is fixed, and afterwards fixing that which is volatile into a precious earth, which is the Vase of the Philosophers, and is wholly perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. When must the Philosopher begin his enterprise ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. At the moment of daybreak, for his energy must never be relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. When may he take his rest?&lt;br /&gt;
A. When the work has come to its perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. At what hour is the end of the work ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. High noon, that is to say, the moment when the Sun is in its fullest power, and the Son of the Day-Star in its most brilliant splendour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the pass-word of Magnesia?&lt;br /&gt;
A. You know whether I can or should answer:--I reserve my speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Give me the greeting of the Philosophers.&lt;br /&gt;
A. Begin ; I will reply to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. Are you an apprentice Philosopher?&lt;br /&gt;
A. My friends, and the wise, know me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What is the age of a Philosopher ?&lt;br /&gt;
A. From the moment of his researches to that of his discoveries, the Philosopher does not age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[^1]: The three prime substances are proved only by fire, which manifests them pure, naked, clean, and simple. In the absence of all ordeal by fire, there is no proving of a substance possible. For fire tests everything, and when the impure matter is separated the three pure substances are displayed. – De Origine Morborum ex Tribus Primis Substanstiis – Paramirum, Lib. I., c. 1. Fire separates that which is constant or fixed from that which is fugitive or volatile. – De Morbis Metallicis, Lib. II., Tract I. Fire is the father or active principle of separation. – &amp;quot;Third Fragment on Tartar&amp;quot; from the Fragmenta Medica.&lt;br /&gt;
[^2]:&lt;br /&gt;
By the mediation of Vulcan, or fire, any metal can be generated from Mercury. At the same time, Mercury is imperfect as a metal; it is semi-generated and wanting in coagulation, which is the end of all metals. Up to the half way point of their generation all metals are Mercury. Gold, for example, is Mercury; but it loses the Mercurial nature by coagulation, and although the properties of Mercury are present in it, they are dead, for their vitality is destroyed by coagulation. – De Morbis Metallicis, Lib. III., Tract II., c. 2. The essences and arcanas which are latent in all the six metals are to be found in the substance of Mercury. – Ibid., c. 3. There are two genera of Mercury, the fixed Mercury of earth and another kind which descends from the daily constellation. –Ibid., Lib. I., Tract II., c. 4. As there is a red and white Sulphur of Marcasites, a yellow, red, and black Sulphur of Talc, a purple and black Sulphur of the Cachimiae, a Sulphur of Cinnabar, and, in like manner, of marble, amethyst, etc., so is there a special Mercury of Copper, Plumbago, Zinc, Arsenic, etc. – Ibid. Mercury is not Quicksilver, for Mercury is dead, while Quicksilver is living. –De Hydropisi.&lt;br /&gt;
[^3]: Nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance, but in the virtue. And this is the principle of the Quintessence, which reduces, say, 20lbs. into a single ounce, and that ounce far exceeds the entire 20lbs. in potency. Hence the less there is of body, the more in proportion is the virtue. – De Origine Morborum Invisibilium, Lib. IV.&lt;br /&gt;
[^4]: Tin or Jupiter, is pure Mercury coagulated with a small quantity of Salt, but combined with a larger proportion of white Sulphur. It derives its colours, white, yellow, or red, from its Mercury. Its sublimation is also by Mercury, and its resolution by Salt, and it is sublimed and resolved by these. – De Elemento Aquae, Tract III., c. 6.&lt;br /&gt;
[^5]: In the generation of Iron there is a larger proportion of Salt and Mercury, while the red Sulphur from which copper proceeds is present in a smaller quantity. It contains also a cuprine salt, but not in equal proportion with Mercury. Its constituents are its own body, which preponderates; then comes Salt, afterwards Mercury, and, lastly, Sulphur. When there is more Salt than the composition of Sulphur requires, the metal can in no wise be made, for it depends upon an equal weight of each. For fluxibility proceeds from Mercury and coagulation from Salt. Accordingly, if there be too much Salt it becomes too hard. – De Elemento Aquae, Lib. I V., Tract III., c. 4.&lt;br /&gt;
[^6]: Venus is the first metal generated by the Archeus of Nature from the three prime principles after the marcasites and cachimiae have been separated from these. It is formed of the gross redness which is purged off from the primal Sulphur of the light red expelled in like manner from the Mercury, and of the deep yellow separated in the purification of the prime Salt by this same Archeus. – Ibid., c. 3.&lt;br /&gt;
[^7]: Lead is the blackness of the three first principles, which, however, is by no means a superfluity, but a peculiar metallic nature in them existing. For all metals are latent in Mercury, and they are all only Mercury. The same is to be concluded concerning Salt and Sulphur. Thus, as copper is the abundant redness of the three principles, so Lead is their blackness; but, at the same time, there are four colours concealed therein – the blackness, purged off from the three principles; redness, which contains a precipitate out of Mercury; whiteness, from the calcination of Mercury; and a certain yellowness derived from Mercury. Thus the grossness and the colours are alike due to Mercury, and Lead is, in fact, a black Mercury. – Ibid., c. 5.&lt;br /&gt;
[^8]: When the three prime principles have been purged of their superfluities, and from the said superfluities the imperfect metals have been generated, there remains nothing gross or crude, either in colour or substance, but only a very subtle nature of a white and purple hue. This is the most pure quality of Mercury, Salt, and Sulphur, most clear and excellent in form, substance, essence, and colour. These two essences, namely, the white and the purple, are separated by the Archeus, and out of the first fixed and coagulated, is formed silver, while from the purple there is generated gold, which is the most noble Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury, separated from all other colours, and consisting of purple alone. Its clayey or yellow appearance is accounted for by the subtlety and clearness of the metal, because all the dull colours are removed. In Silver the most prevalent colours are green and blue, which are respectively derived from the Mercury and the Salt, the Sulphur contributing nothing in the matter of colouring. On the other hand, in gold the purple colour is derived from Salt, the pellucid redness from Sulphur, and the yellow from Mercury. – Ibid., c. 8.&lt;br /&gt;
[^9]: Verbenas adole pingues, et mascula tura. – Virg., Ecl. viii. 65.&lt;br /&gt;
[^10]: Alchemy is, so to speak, a kind of lower heaven, by which the sun is separated from the moon, day from night, medicine from poison, what is useful from what is refuse. – De Colica. Therefore learn Alchemy, which is otherwise called Spagyria. This teaches you to discern between the true and the false. Such a Light of Nature is it that it is a mode of proof in all things, and walks in light. From this light of Nature we ought to know and speak, not from mere phantasy, whence nothing is begotten save the four humours and their compounds, augmentation, stagnation, and decrease, with other trifles of this kind. These proceed, not from the clear intellect, that full treasure-house of a good man, but rather are based on a fictitious and insecure foundation. – Paramirum, Lib. I., c. 3.&lt;br /&gt;
[^11]: When the occult dispenser of Nature in the prime principles that is to say, the potency called Ares, has produced the gross and rough genera of stones, and no further grossness remains, a diaphanous and subtle substance remains, out of which the Archeus of Nature generates the precious stones or gems. – De Elemento Aquae, Lib. IV., Tract IV., c. 10.&lt;br /&gt;
[^12]: The body f the Emerald is derived from a kind of petrine Mercury. It receives from the same its colour, coagulated with spirit of Salt. – Ibid., c. 12.&lt;br /&gt;

[^17]: In the matter of body and colour the Sapphire is generated from Mercury (the prime principle). It is formed over white Sulphur and white Salt from a pallid petrine Mercury. Hence white Sapphires frequently occur because a white Mercury concurs in the formation. In like manner a lute-coloured Mercury sometimes produces a clay-like hue. – Ibid., c. 15.&lt;br /&gt;
[^18]: The Ruby and similar gems possessing a ruddy hue are generated from the red of Sulphur, and their body is of petrine Mercury. For Mercury is the body of every precious stone. – Ibid., c. 13.&lt;br /&gt;
[^19]: The Carbuncle is formed of the most transparent matter which is conserved in the three principles. Mercury is the body and Sulphur the colouring thereof, with a modicum of the spirit of Salt, on account of the coagulation. All light abounds therein, because Sulphur contains in itself a clear quality of light, as the art of its transmutation demonstrates. – Ibid., c. 11.&lt;br /&gt;
[^20]: There are two species of red Corals – one a dull red, which varies between sub-purple and semi-black; the other a resplendent and brilliant red. As the colours differ, so also do the virtues. There is also a whitish species which is almost destitute of efficacy. In a word, as the Coral diminishes in redness, so it weakens in its qualities. Herbarius Theophrasti; De Corallis.&lt;br /&gt;

[^23]: The Amethyst is an extract of Salt, while Marble and Chalcedony are extracted from the same principle through the Amethyst. – Ibid.&lt;br /&gt;
[^24]: The origin of Crystals is to be referred to water. They contain within them a spirit of coagulation whereby they are coagulated, as water by the freezing and glacial stars. – Lib. Meteorum, c. 7.&lt;br /&gt;
[^25]: The work under this title is cited occasionally in other writings of Paracelsus, but is not included in the great folio published at Geneva in 1688. It was first issued at Basle in1575, and was accompanied with copious annotations in Latin by the editor, Gerard Dorne. This personage was a very persevering collector of the literary remains of Paracelsus, but is not altogether free from the suspicion of having elaborated his original. The Aurora is by some regarded as an instance in point; though no doubt in the main it is a genuine work of the Sage of Hohenheim, yet in some respects it does seem to approximate somewhat closely to previous schools of Alchemy, which can scarcely he regarded as representing the actual standpoint of Paracelsus.&lt;br /&gt;
[^26]:&lt;br /&gt;
He who created man the same also created science. What has man in any place without labour? When the mandate went forth: Thou shalt live by the sweat of thy brow, there was, as it were, a new creation. When God uttered His fiat the world was made. Art, however, was not then made, nor was the light of Nature. But when Adam was expelled from Paradise, God created for him the light of Nature when He bade him live by the work of his hands. In like manner, He created for Eve her special light when He said to her: In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children. Thus, and there, were these beings made human and earthy that were before like angelicals. ... Thus, by the word were creatures made, and by this same word was also made the light which was necessary to man. ... Hence the interior man followed from the second creation, after the expulsion from Paradise. ... Before the Fall, that cognition which was requisite to man had not begun to develop in him. He received it from the angel when he was cast out of Paradise. ... Man was made complete in the order of the body, but not in the order of the arts. – De Caducis, Par. III.&lt;br /&gt;
[^27]: No work precisely corresponding co this title is extant among the writings of Paracelsus. The subjects to which reference is made are discussed in the Philosophia Sagax.&lt;br /&gt;
[^28]: Before all things it is necessary to have a right understanding of the nature of Celestial Magic. It originates from divine virtue. There is that magic which Moses practised, and there is the maleficent magic of the sorcerers. There are, then, different kinds of Magi. So also there is what is called the Magic of Nature; there is the Celestial Magus; there is the Magus of Faith, that is, one whose faith makes him whole. There is, lastly, the Magus of Perdition. – Philosophia Sagax, Lib. II., c. 6.&lt;br /&gt;
[^29]: Learn, therefore, Astronomic Magic, which otherwise I call cabalistic. – De Pestilitate, Tract I. This art, formerly called cabalistic, was in the beginning named caballa, and afterwards caballia. It is a species of magic. It was also, but falsely, called Gabanala, by one whose knowledge of the subject was profound. It was of an unknown Ethnic origin, and it passed subsequently to the Chaldaeans and Hebrews, by both of whom it was corrupted. – Philosophia Sagax, Lib. I., s. v. Probatio in Scientiam Nectromantricam.&lt;br /&gt;
[^30]: The object which received the influence and exhibited the sign thereof appears to have been termed Gamaheu, Gamahey etc. But the name was chiefly given to certain stones on which various and wonderful images and figures of men and animals have been found naturally depicted, being no work of man, but the result of the providence and counsel of God. – De Imaginibus, c. 7 and c. 13. It is possible, magically, for a man to project his infiuence into these stones and some other substances. – Ibid., c. 13. But they also have their own inherent virtue, which is indicated by the shape and the special nature of the impression. – Ibid., c. 7. There was also an artificial Gamaheus invented and prepared by the Magi, and this seems to have been more powerful. – De Carduo Angelico.&lt;br /&gt;
[^31]: Man was regarded by Paracelsus as himself in a special manner the true Quintessence. After God had created all the elements, stars, and every other created thing, and had disposed them according to His will, He proceeded, lastly, to the forming of man. He extracted the essence out of the four elements into one mass; He extracted also the essence of wisdom, art, and reason out of the stars, and this twofold essence He congested into one mass: which mass Scripture calls the slime of the earth. From that mass two bodies were made – the sidereal and the elementary. These, according to the light of Nature, are called the quintum esse. The mass was extracted, and therein the firmament and the elements were condensed. What was extracted from the four after this manner constituted a fifth. The Quintessence is the nucleus and the place of the essences and properties of all things in the universal world. All nature came into the hand of God – all potency, all property, all essence of the superior and inferior globe. All these had God joined in His hand, and from these He formed man according to His image. – Philosophia Sagax, Lib. I., c. 2.&lt;br /&gt;
[^32]: All created things proceed from the coagulated, and after coagulation must go on to resolution. From resolution proceed all procreated things. – De Tartaro (fragment). All bodies of minerals are coagulated by salt. – De Natraralibus Aquis, Lib. III., Tract 2.&lt;br /&gt;
[^33]: So acute is the potency of calcined blood, that if it be poured slowly on iron it produces in the first place a whiteness thereon, and then generates rust. – Scholia in Libros de Tartaro. In Lib. II., Tract II.&lt;br /&gt;
[^34]: One recipe for the fixation of arsenic is as follows: – Take equal parts of arsenic and nitre. Place these in a tigillum, set upon coals so that they may begin to boil and to evaporate. Continue till ebullition and evaporation cease, and the substances shall have settled to the bottom of the vessel like fat melting in a frying-pan; then, for the space of an hour and a half (the longer the better), set it apart to settle. Subsequently pour the compound upon marble, and it will acquire a gold colour. In a damp place it will assume the consistency of a fatty fluid. – De Naturalibus Rebus, c. 9. Again: The fixation of arsenic is performed by salt of urine, after which it is converted by itself into an oil. – Chirurgia Minor, Lib. II.&lt;br /&gt;
[^35]: Concerning the kinds of arsenic, it is to be noted that there are those which flow forth from their proper mineral or metal, and are called native arsenics. Next there are arsenics out of metals after their kind. Then there are those made by Art thBy the mediation of Vulcan, or fire, any metal can be generated from Mercury. At the same time, Mercury is imperfect as a metal; it is semi-generated and wanting in coagulation, which is the end of all metals. Up to the half way point of their generation all metals are Mercury. Gold, for example, is Mercury; but it loses the Mercurial nature by coagulation, and although the properties of Mercury are present in it, they are dead, for their vitality is destroyed by coagulation. – De Morbis Metallicis, Lib. III., Tract II., c. 2. The essences and arcanas which are latent in all the six metals are to be found in the substance of Mercury. – Ibid., c. 3. There are two genera of Mercury, the fixed Mercury of earth and another kind which descends from the daily constellation. –Ibid., Lib. I., Tract II., c. 4. As there is a red and white Sulphur of Marcasites, a yellow, red, and black Sulphur of Talc, a purple and black Sulphur of the Cachimiae, a Sulphur of Cinnabar, and, in like manner, of marble, amethyst, etc., so is there a special Mercury of Copper, Plumbago, Zinc, Arsenic, etc. – Ibid. Mercury is not Quicksilver, for Mercury is dead, while Quicksilver is living. –De Hydropisi.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2021-10-04T09:55:19Z</updated>
		<id>https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/original_beauty/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;man-is-not-evil.-man-is-good.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Man is NOT evil. Man is GOOD. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/original_beauty/#man-is-not-evil.-man-is-good.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change core premise.&lt;br /&gt;
We now that religion though touted often as the solution or panacea to prevent or &amp;quot;reduce&amp;quot; the amount of evil in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only way to reduce the darkness is to increase the light!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And has been most often used as a tool/weapon of oppression and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if man is essentially evil, and a &amp;quot;sinner&amp;quot;, according to current religious view, then one must assume that our leaders - who are just human - are evil too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which will bring us to the conclusion that we are in the grip of a powerful, oppressive group of evil leaders!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;innocent until proven guilty&amp;quot; approach. However, guilt is decided according to the criterion and biases of the legal context within which this guilt is being decided. In the case of religion, there is the application of the laws of God according to the perspective and understanding of that particular culture - all influenced by human foibles and weaknesses and desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this premise of intrinsicly evil, has resulted in the doctrine of &amp;quot;Orignal Sin&amp;quot;. Which proposes that God made us, and the world around us, essentially evil. If it is, in this case, up to Christ to redeem us, at worst. At best, for each one of us to make the right choices - even when we receive the wrong education - one that teaches us how to serve in society, but not how to deal with the moral, ethical or spiritual aspects of one&#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-create-evil&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Why create Evil? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/original_beauty/#why-create-evil&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God is Good, why create evil people? No. Rather, why create everyone evil, and then we need to spend the rest of our lives &amp;quot;redeeming&amp;quot; ourselves? It is like being born in debt, and having to spend the rest of your lives paying someone back for the debt you &amp;quot;inherited&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one has a purpose, would you not want those that you exercise influence and control over to be performing their true work, expressing their G-d given gifts for the benefit of all? In other words, would not a true leader look after his people - not like a shepherd herding his sheep because as is said: &amp;quot;The sheep spend all their lives afraid of the wolf, when it is the shepherd who they need to fear!&amp;quot;? Ensure and enable them to express their best, obey the will of G-d, so as to say? Would not a King have to be a priest as well? Or at least a Shaman? Able to guide His people - just like Moses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we fritter our way our time and resources, and many lives, fighting this very evil placed in us? Perhaps this acceptance of an intrinsic sin in the human being is incorrect. We arrive neither intrinsically good nor bad and are formed and &amp;quot;taught&amp;quot; by the influences and general environment we grow up in. We are shaped by what we encounter during our &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/consciousness.md&quot;&gt;awakening into consciousness&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are surrounded by love, you learn love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are surrounded by anger and violence, you learn love that is consists of anger and violence...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this realm, there are no absolutes - besides birth &amp;amp; death. &amp;quot;Every natural law has an exception&amp;quot;. So, there are some who are bad - and some who are good. And their influences wax and wane, in an eternal cosmic dance. Thus, any system has to take into account the bad extremes. In the words of Warren Buffet: &amp;quot;It is not a victory that will ever wipe you out. But one loss certainly can.&amp;quot; In every barrel, in every toss, there is the possibility (however slight) of a &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kabbalah-of-the-soul&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Kabbalah of the Soul &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/forward/#the-kabbalah-of-the-soul&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had an uncanny intuitive sense about the connection between the divine and humanity, and having had a profound spiritual experience, after being touch by an Indian mystic, went about finding the tools by which to express this enormous insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within the Jewish esoteric tradition humankind plays a pivotal role in the perfection of the divine personality by uniting the finite with the infinite.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leet attempted to erect a new framework for understanding the mechanism of the transformative spiritual work that enables the human soul to reach increasingly higher dimensions of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;renewing-the-covenant:&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Renewing the Covenant: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/forward/#renewing-the-covenant:&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provides access to Jewish spirituality as a means for achieving higher consciousness. A path that could deepen the devotions of both non-observant and observant Jews. This process of &lt;strong&gt;covenant renewal&lt;/strong&gt; begins with effective kabbalistic techniques of meditation, combining mantra with visualisation; then proceeds through the return to a &amp;quot;reconstructed &lt;strong&gt;Sinai-Sabbath&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;; and arrives at the culminating practice of ritual prayer, the performance of which can fulfill the kabbalistic purpose of creation. This process has hellp many to discover forms of spiritual practice precisely tailored for the modern world, as well as a new appreciation for the rich spiritual heritage of Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explores the false temptations of worldy power and pleasure that lead to the fall of the soul and the meaans of its redemption. Through a powerful meditative technique called &lt;strong&gt;the Transformative Moment&lt;/strong&gt;, the workings of which are exemplified by Jacob and Joseph and which allow the individual to progress all the higher levels of the soul, and even to attain the miraculous powers of the legendary spiritual masters. Further correlating the hierarchy of soul levels with Ezekiel&#39;s throne vision to show the various paths the soul may travel toward self-realisation: sex, love, power, knowledge, holiness and unification. The first four paths relate to the four-faced living creatures (&lt;em&gt;Chayot&lt;/em&gt;) of Ezekiel&#39;s vision--the bull-ox, lion, eagle and man. The final two paths relate to the prophet and the envisioned image on the throne that he recognises to be his divine higher self--the knowledge that defines the secret doctrine of the whole of the Jewish mystical tradition culminating in the Kabbalah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This required a vast reconstruction of the knowledge of the ancient Jewish priest-scientists, with vital implications for contemporary spirituality and science. What emerges is Kabbalah as an ancient Hebrew sacred science that used geometry, sound and number to linke the finite world of human experience with the infinite realm of the divine, using teachings extending back thousands of years to explicate key concepts of quantum physics and quantum cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-secret-doctrine-of-the-kabbalah:&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/forward/#the-secret-doctrine-of-the-kabbalah:&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resurrects this ancient body of knowledge to reveal eternal truths that could have a profound and positive effect on contemporary spirituality. This text is an exploration of Hebraic sacred science that explains as never before the meaning of the central cosmological diagram of the entire Western esoteric--the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is shown to enshrine a key to the purpose of the cosmos, a key that has vast implications for modern physics and cosmology. Taking what has always been a two-dimensional model of the famous kabbalistic tree of anthropos and projecting a three-dimensional body more common to other hermetic traditions. The final synthesis is a culmination in which the universe and its divine child, &lt;em&gt;perfected&lt;/em&gt; humanity, achieve that union of the finite and infinite that has ever been the secret goal of the Kabbalah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;universal-kabbalah&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Universal Kabbalah &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/universal_kabbalah/forward/#universal-kabbalah&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;A daring an innovative exposition of the secret doctrines and practices of traditional Jewish mysticism uniquely applicable to the present.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-- Gerald Epstein, M.D., director of the American Institute for Mental Imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconcile the more scientific aspects of the highly technical sacred science with the inner connection of her longing and desire so eloquently described in her literary work
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unconditional love and the warrior:&lt;br /&gt;
Both are involved with the conversion of love into power albeit with a difference: The lover&#39;s slefless concern to empower the powerless diffuses his/her power, while the self-possession of the spiritual knight concentrates it. It is this concentration that is needed to direct spiritual power into manifestation, a concentration that depends upon possessing rather than losing the self. Such possession is also different from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An atheist, one who does not believe in G-d, and thus would not believe in a soul, or an afterlife, or reincarnation, etc - would then conclude that our brief existences are mere chance flashes in the pan of this random universe, and once we die, we die - it is over, kaput, ended. And the only way we could be remembered is by what we left behind. What monuments you built, or discoveries you stumbled upon - something that you would be recorded in the history of the victors. It is the most horrifying thought for a living being - one who is aware of his impending death. It is a cross which is uniquely human. No other animal seems to bear it as heavily as do we. Nevertheless, that looming abyss of death is a terrifying thought, and we will do anything to avoid it - even kill another. [An eye for an eye will produce a kingdom ruled by one-eyed men and women] Thus our &amp;quot;health&amp;quot; industry spent billions on keeping people alive! Helping sick people live healthy lives requires sick people. You product is health, but your inventory is sick people. If the majority of people were healthy, the &amp;quot;health&amp;quot; industry would fail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&#39;s gather under the banner of life. Let&#39;s build a nation of people who live healthy lives. Let&#39;s provide one another with living food and clean living water first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralised-system&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Decentralised system &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/#decentralised-system&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It aims for a decentralised system that actively focuses on NOT preventing the less-fortunate people&#39;s access to the resources that they need to live decent lives. To have support and encouragement would be superb. However, I think the need for control is what requires those in power to strictly regulate ALL access to resources - ultimate power being the control of all access to every resource The network solution to that is, being powered by and from community groups their communal needs, not by obeying the commands of a centralised system with an overarching authority – which is the kind of hierarchical control systems we have at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are welcome to participate in our exchange system as well. It is based purely on energy exchange. It has two forms. The first is that of &amp;quot;energy at rest&amp;quot;, and it has a certain &amp;quot;measure&amp;quot;. The other is &amp;quot;energy at work&amp;quot; or force and it has a similar measure. Though these can be described with a number of other comparative variables as well - which we will not go into yet. [Think of volts, amps &amp;amp; ohms and their relationship; as well as watts, coulombs &amp;amp; joules]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;flow&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Flow &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/#flow&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The flow cannot be about enabling teams to become more productive, so that their masters can achieve more wealth and reap more benefits for themselves and those around them, to the detriment of the greater population. This flow has to be to achieve better relationship with this background upon which we dance. It is like not listening to the music, when dancing a duet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Somewhere there was a period where that was being expressed to the general benefit of the general population. And we were prepared to pay the price to achieve that material success and relative ease. Now the success of those ventures, is threatening our very existence. Probably because we are not willing to pay the price to maintain these benefits.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;freedom&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Freedom &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/#freedom&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom from... what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom from oppression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom from bondage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom from tyrants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom from liars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom from psychopathic leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom for... what?&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the time, we want freedom to do, or explore, the things we are not allowed or permitted to explore. The great adventure is escaping from your confinement and venturing out into the wilderness to experience something greater.&lt;br /&gt;
And there are those of us who are terrified of what lurks in the darkness beyond which we can see.&lt;br /&gt;
A balance between both is what we seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I ask, Freedom for... what?&lt;br /&gt;
Often we escape from one bondage, only to find ourselves caged in another. Can we ever escape that bondage, even if it is only to our own petty or grandiose desires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Egotism: The lowest form of freedom, is freedom to do what I want. To have what I want. Completely ego driven is very attractive to many who doubt their own worth, but is in the end so lonely, that it drives many to madness or to suicide. For, if successful, their whole existence will eventually consist only of reflections of their own egos - nothing else will be able to live in their space, and its surrounds. If unsuccessful, they will be absorbed into their own fantasies, and could sink into some deep dark place, from which any weird energy could explode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altruism: The next, normal humane level is that of service to an-other, or in a more developed form, others. Pure altruism, to dedicate oneself totally to the needs of other, is noble, but can be draining on the soul. There must be something left for yourself, otherwise you will dissolve in the ocean of needy. Take care, that it does not become a need, and thus essentially ego-feeding, instead of ego-reducing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seers: The we have the madmen and women who are driven by some vision that they see, or hear, or feel. They are a mixture of pure egotist, and yet often they are not driven by the gains of what they seek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;light-and-dark&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Light &amp;amp; Dark &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/#light-and-dark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot lesson the dark by focusing on it. Focusing on it is feeding it. We can only reduce the dark by increasing the light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot solve the problem by dwelling on it. Eventually it (the darkness) will swallow us.&lt;br /&gt;
Only by living in the light can you overcome the darkness - though we are never free of it. For darkness is formed by light. &amp;quot;He formed the light, and created the darkness.&amp;quot; One can only create form in light with darkness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if we obsess over death - if &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/atheist.html&quot;&gt;we are in terror of it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;objectification&amp;quot; of living beings. and in fact, &amp;quot;non-living&amp;quot; objects as well - this producing the concept of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does sustainable really mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it a viable concept?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is perhaps a better paradigm that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/TODO/codependent.html&quot;&gt;mutually beneficial co-dependence (MBCo)&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the same volcanic effect that the theories of quantum dynamics had on classical physics. [Perhaps the very term Quantum Physics is an anachronism, like Real TV. Perhaps this &amp;quot;Quantum Physics&amp;quot; is not physics at all, as everything it talks about is non-physical actually. Yet it does a good job of &amp;quot;proving&amp;quot; its reality. In the same way, if the Shaman could produce results that could be emperically measured (according to the accepted, standard measurments - those measurements that are acceptable to the accepted rules of measurement. This is the same as the impact of a new legal system on indigenous people - which needs always to be backed up by military power) who now have to accept new measurements of social behaviour imposed by the ruling class (which is what actually makes them the &amp;quot;ruling class&amp;quot; - not any inherint human characteristics. Which is why we have more popular respect for the successful entrepeneur, rather than the privileged noblesse. We look at them with the fascinated stare of the mouse watching the snake as it slithers towards it, hoping that it will strike the mouse frozen beside it. We know that these people have the ability to destroy our lives in a moment if they so wish. We fight to hold back their desire to control everyone and everything. But we must remember that they are just scared of the Divine nature of the universe and themselves - which is the last thing they will be able to acknowledge, having spent their entire existence catering to the emperical (measurable according to standard accepted measurements) human nature of their being. And this is an attempt to build walls around the terror of extinction, of not being anymore, forgotten in the ashes of time. So they need to build huge edifices to their greatness, pyramid and towers. They have to fight great wars and accomplish grandiouse (and often idiotic) things - to impress everyone, and everyone can applaud their greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I ask you O great ones who rule over us and wish to control us like ants, like little slaves to do their bidding, and feed their petty, mostly material, desires with our juices - how large is your pyramid next to the giant nebula that gaze upon us in pity? If you are remembered for a 1000 years, O my Emperor, how long is that in the eyes of our very planet, which your science says has been here for 15,000,000,000 years? Well, I say, however, or whatever built this planet, is going to be remembered for far longer than any one of you will be. And is capable of producing things far greater than any of you, or your wizards, whether of science or magic, could ever hope to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The beauty of this strange Viral time is that it is clearly showing the difference between these two.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-maccabean-test&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Maccabean Test &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/game-changer/#the-maccabean-test&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are standing told that in order to continue to live our lives normally, we will need to kiss the ass of the statue of the pig that they have placed in our temples. Is not the &amp;quot;virus&amp;quot; that keeps us from gathering in our temples, and the vaccination that will allow us, the same thing? It is not the virus that is preventing the communial prayer, but the rules of our society that are not allowing us to gather there as they say there is a virus that prevents us. That is the pig they have created and placed there. Now, in taking the virus, you are kissing the statue - you are agreeing, nay willing, your body to act in accordance with the wishes of this new rule. And in doing so, are accepting their mandated behaviour. For to need accept it, is tantamount to revolution. And the punishment for such treason follows soon after. At first, no-one is forced. But once a critical mass is reached - they called it &amp;quot;herd immunity&amp;quot; - the balance will be upset, and they will have to become mandated, because if those who have submitted, believing that the new rule will improve their lot - which is the common mantra of those in power, or who wish to be in power - and it seldom improves the lot of this class, except that the chaos causes movement of certain segments, and when the dust has settled, the system will produce the same situation of the ruled and the rulers. It Are you going to bow to this because you need to earn a living? Or are you going to rather die at Masada, having stood up to your last breath against this evil that is taking over your world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you are chomping at the bit, wondering what is this &amp;quot;new narrative&amp;quot;, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard many already, and even perhaps have one or two of your own. But, let those who write stories come up with the myths and legends that will feed us and calm us in the dark nights. What I speak of is the &lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt;, that silent sound that cries and moans in the background, hidden half-hidden in the stillness between two waves on the ocean. That something that you struggle to understand that leads you along strange and often uncomfortable paths, and takes you into dark and challenging spaces. Often you too have sufferred trauma as a child - I mean. nowadays we talk of the very trauma of birth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;though there is little popular talk of the emotional trauma of the solution to that - ripping the baby out of the mother&#39;s womb through a pre-birth incision in her belly through which the child now enters the world. Instead of accepting the channel made by G-d, we have superceded it with the man-made entry into the world. Welcome to the new-age of trans-human existence, oh Indigo child.

&lt;p&gt;Remove the evil nations from your midst.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, that includes the innocents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would China be included? Or Russia? They are not waging aggressive wars in the regions. They might be intent on expanding their influence &amp;amp; control - but they are not doing in military and with blatent aggression - like the US is, and has been doing. It, unfortunately, might qualify as being evil. However, these three are too big to fail - and thus, even if one of your pillars start to fail, you will have to upgrade it, fix it, else the building will fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time when future was unknown, the focus was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/outcome/intention.html&quot;&gt;intent&lt;/a&gt;. After having gained some &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/outcome/control.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;control&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (or so it may seem) - in terms of predictability/probability - of future events, &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/outcome/outcome.html&quot;&gt;outcome&lt;/a&gt; becomes as, if not more critical, important as intention was in the ancient and modern times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These outcomes need to be measured through the same emperical measurements as science is using to measure the &amp;quot;imaginary&amp;quot; energies that are swirling all around us, which we, for many centuries, were generally unaware of (the quantum). And the principles derived by the same principles, and as accurate in prediction as F=ma is in its role of keeping the outcome on target!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcome can only be measured in relation to the dynamics of the system itself. Whether postive or negative depends on the breadth of the measurement of the outcome (whether local or global/general), and its original impetus (what caused it), and its depth (how deep/powerful is its source).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusions drawn from data is dependent on the system of measurement used, plus the tools of interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years, ever since I was a young man, I could not understand why there was such a paucity of collectives that organised around the needs of local groups. I suppose, my current hypothesis, is that this is a threat to the dominance of the the elements of centralised power, which are seldom, if ever, about the needs of the people, but more concerned with maintained the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that not essentially what a corporation is? And is not a coorporation allowed complete self-rule - in other words, it can decide how to run itself. It could structured upon socialist or equal rights, perhaps a sharing internal economy, with autonomy and empowerement encourage at all levels. People refer to a Kibbutz structure as a socialist one, but could not a corporation be a socialist organisation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at ourselves as some sort of &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/bg002%20-%20Masc%20&amp;amp;%20Fem/objectification.html&quot;&gt;object&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;

What if we viewed ourselves and our fellow beings as works-in-progress? Imagine everyone walked around with an &amp;quot;under construction&amp;quot; sign. Because who dies completely fulfilled? There is always something or, if you are lucky, someone left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not look at ourselves, our world, in fact the whole darn universe, as dynamic systems. Systems that are always in some sort of flux, some of which is obvious and some of which is not. There is so much that happens, and that could happen, that we are unaware of, and that affect us. We are like fish in the ocean. All we can do, as regards the ocean itself, is just live in it and with it. We can search for food, and harvest what we can from our surroundings - but the currents that bring the nourishment, and the sun that nurtures them, and the many complex events that have to occur in order for this food to arrive and this current to flow is beyond anything we can imagine, and this flux affects us, even if we are seemingly still &amp;quot;who we were&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in our lives we think we are a constant, and not in constant flux. Besides the fact that our body is, our emotions are, and our mind is constanly breathing, feeling and thinking. How balanced they are depends on a number of factors, but training and practice is at their core. But as we grow, we move from one &amp;quot;type&amp;quot; of person to another. I am not the toddler I was when I was born. I have grown from being the young boy I was cavorting around the garden. I am not longer the father I was to my young children. Although I might still be, and always will be, their father, I am not longer the father I was then, for they are grown with their own children. And so it goes on - till I die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;roles&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Roles &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/bg002%20-%20Masc%20&amp;amp;%20Fem/#roles&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the masculine it is about achieving something - and then he will be satisfied/happy. For the feminine is it about being in love &amp;amp; happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; that the masculine achieves has to be constantly maintained and monitored. The more he achieves, the more attention these will demand from him. And one of the main tools of the &lt;em&gt;Sitra Achra&lt;/em&gt;, the evil impulse, is to keep us occupied in the realm of the mundane so that we have no time to spend in the realm of the divine. That is to say that most of our day is taken up with mundane activities, most of our goals are empirical, and very little, if any, of our day is devoted to our relationship with the Divine. How many of your daily thoughts are taken up in contemplating what we don&#39;t know, what is not there? Being still and listening silent speech, rather than thinking and about the things and experiences and events of your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man must learn to respond, then he must practise responding in a constrained and balanced fashion. The woman must learn to contain her responses, and choose the appropriate responses, and, interestingly, the appropriate time to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the woman is well-defined, as the role of the man needs to be. The better defined that each role of the masculine is, the easier it is for the woman to be secure in her place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt; without vulnerability is not love at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love, too, needs constant nourishment, though we know that material things are not what love needs - though gifts are always lovely. Admittedly, both men and women desire a materially comfortable life, that is not under question. And achieving that is a worthwhile goal. However, it is not sufficient to nourish love, though it might be sufficient to assuage the masculine, it certainly will leave the feminine in exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;desire-for-power&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Desire for Power &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/bg002%20-%20Masc%20&amp;amp;%20Fem/#desire-for-power&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire for power, greed, is a feminine trait. It devours whatever it can, an unbalanced form of receiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G-d is infinite&lt;/strong&gt; in all directions. Thus He/She is infinitely vulnerable too, just as He/She can be incredibly cruel too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&#39;t look for a religion. We have a destination, and they will take the path that will best lead them to their destination, not taking into account the disruptive effects of their destinies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soul is immortal.&lt;br /&gt;
It hears and sees and keeps everything that happens, or at least a portion of it. This portion we call a pointer and, as hypnosis has shown, again and again, through this mechanism, everything can be recalled. Freud called it the unconscious, then the sub-conscious, now it is repressed, etc... It is the deep reservoir of our experiences. We collect them and return with them, like a wandering explorer who returns with a knapsack full of experiences. Like arriving back at school after the summer vacation, filled with stories of the adventures you had.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; The USA, in its typical empirical, and capitalistic fashion, had to manufacture this summer vacation, and introduced the spring break event - which has now grown into a global sex, drugs and perversion fest for our young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of soul is to serve -&lt;br /&gt;
Because it does not need anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soul needs to be resurrected in the body to good (&lt;em&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each incarnation expresses one purpose of the soul.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You are a soul, here to play a role&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marriage union of two souls becoming one is the re-union of a soul that had split apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a mathematical approach to the spiritual realm, we seek spiritual equations with which we can express the dynamics of the system we are in more truthfully. There may be a spiritual calculus which can be used to describe the interactions that is more descriptive. Just as mathematics challenged and made more coherent, a large portions of our interactions with the world around us, so this spiritual mathematics would do to challenge much of the flotsam that floats around the central lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematics does not posit a self as fundamental to being, just a sense of self. We, however, have a false sense of self by believing that any meaningful understanding of this self can be separate from the environment in which it was and is experiencing, as if we could be separate from the brain processing. I mean, we think in our native tongue... and how many different languages have humans already spoken that we know of - and how many more are there to come?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---## Spiritual/Material&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enmesh the spiritual in the material in a very human way. We hide our lies and deceptions in that hidden, imaginary space, as well as our beauty and love. But what if the consequences of what we do materially have, essentially, material consequences, and not the spiritual ones that we normally are concerned about. Let us first focus on the purely material consequences of our actions, before we delve in the hidden aspects - and that is what I think jurisprudence is expressing. However the judicial system that emerges is crafted by those in power, and thus becomes a tool for maintaining that power - if not in the beginning, but without a doubt emerges at some stage. It starts with revolution to gain freedom, and then the leaders of the revolution become the oppressors - just different faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[NOTE: Revolution - from the world revolve. So a revolution does not mean inherent change, they are generally just face-lifts. Evolution speaks of inherent change in the way it was done. To quote a Sages: &amp;quot;That the only form of evolution is to one in which you become better than your previous self&amp;quot;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice here, I do not say that they do not affect the spiritual realm, but perhaps not in the manner and due to the events as we believe. As the system is continuous, or recursive - in that the every event is based on a sequence of events that occurred so that the seminal event could manifest. One cannot have vision without an eye, and a &amp;quot;brain&amp;quot; or perceptor of some nature that can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; the vision. In other words, it has both the mechanism/technology available to see, and the perceptive capability to perceive and cognite (in some meaningful fashion) what is being seen. The one is purely technical, or empirical, the other is uncertain. To the materialist, it is the chemicals, or microtubules, or some other physical measurable event that occurs... whereas to the imaginative, there seems to be another element involved that we cannot measure with our empirical measurements, and is uncertain as to where exactly it is situation (in the brain - or elsewhere) - this we realm of spirit, or soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have entered the month of &lt;em&gt;Elul&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Rosh Ha&#39;shanah&lt;/em&gt; and the High Holy Days are coming. It feels so ominous. I don’t know about you - I teach Torah for a living - but each year, I dread these days. I’m dreading sitting in synagogue for hours and hours, doing my best to pay attention, but mostly spacing out. The prayers are in Hebrew, but even in the English, there’s so much poetry, it’s difficult to understand, and relate to. I feel guilty about that. Guilty that these days are supposed to be really important, and more often than not, I don’t prepare, or don’t prepare well enough that I can understand and follow everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be that these days are so difficult to relate to because of all the guilt? &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; is known as the Day of Judgment; &lt;em&gt;Yom Kippur&lt;/em&gt; as the Day of Repentance or Atonement. It’s like guilt-fest. Each year, we sit and remember about how horrible we’ve been, and we resolve never to be that way again... Except, how many of us really do, are even able to do, complete and utter repentance, walking away from our sins, never to repeat them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m supposed to feel guilty for my failures. I try to do &lt;em&gt;teshuvah&lt;/em&gt;, repentence, but really I know I’m just gonna sin again, so I feel guilty that my &lt;em&gt;teshuvah&lt;/em&gt; isn’t real &lt;em&gt;teshuvah&lt;/em&gt;, and that kinda makes me not wanna do &lt;em&gt;teshuvah&lt;/em&gt;, and then I feel guilty for that, I mean, it’s just one big, bad loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I were to tell you that the words &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt;, Judgment Day, never appear in the Torah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Cancel shul! We’re going to Disneyland!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not quite. The sages in the &lt;em&gt;mishnah&lt;/em&gt; are the ones that teach us that &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; is Judgment Day. But what I want to suggest is that the reason why you can’t find Judgment Day in the Torah, is because judgment... isn’t the true essence of the day. And until we understand what &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; really is about, at its core, we’re not really ready to observe it with the right frame of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us explore deeper what &lt;em&gt;Rosh Ha&#39;shanah&lt;/em&gt; is really about, and how it might help us stand before G-d, and before ourselves, not feeling the harshness and the gloom of guilt, but truly celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;segment-2&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Segment 2 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-2&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly we have to deal with this problem: The words &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt;, or Judgment Day in English, don’t appear anywhere in the Torah. The Rabbis in the &lt;em&gt;Mishnah&lt;/em&gt; call this day “Judgment Day,” and that’s how we got to all the laws and the customs and the prayers about Judgment Day. But still, that should give us pause. I mean, did the rabbis just make this stuff up? Where did &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; get this from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at what the Rabbis themselves say about this day and see if we can pick up any clues. Here&#39;s how the &lt;em&gt;Mishna&lt;/em&gt; describes that judgment. On &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;all the inhabitants of the earth pass before G-d&amp;quot;, like “a flock of sheep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;            וְכָל בָּאֵי עוֹלָם יַעַבְרוּן לְפָנֶיךָ כִּבְנֵי מָרוֹן כְּבַקָּרַת רוֹעֶה
               עֶדְרוֹ מַעֲבִיר צֹאנוֹ תַּחַת שִׁבְטוֹ כֵּן תַּעֲבִיר וְתִסְפֹּר
                              וְתִמְנֶה וְתִפְקֹד נֶפֶשׁ כָּל חָי
                 וְתַחְתֹּךְ קִצְבָה לְכָל בְּרִיָּה וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם

      As a shepherd herds his flock,
      Causing his sheep to pass beneath his staff,
      So do You cause to pass, count, and record,
      Visiting the souls of all living,
      Decreeing the length of their days,
      Inscribing their judgment.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it says in Psalm 33:15 - הַיֹּצֵ֣ר יַ֣חַד לִבָּ֑ם הַ֝מֵּבִ֗ין אֶל־כׇּל־מַעֲשֵׂיהֶֽם&lt;br /&gt;
- G-d, the One who forms all of our hearts, who understands all of our actions, examines our souls, looking at us closely, at who we are and what we have done with our gifts - like a shepherd counting His sheep. So it’s exactly what we have been told. The sages are describing G-d, kinda like the eye of Sauron, lidless, always watching, seeing all the sins and misdeeds, judging us for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all the sages say about Judgment Day. In fact, upon further study, we begin to see that they actually gave us a different notion of this day. It discusses what are the appropriate prayers to say on Judgment Day. Instead of telling us to be guilty and pray for mercy because: “the great lidless eye is watching, the shepherd’s gaze escapes no one, beg, beg for forgiveness!” The sages in the Talmud say something else. They suggest three basic themes of prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Malchiyot&lt;/em&gt; - Kingship&lt;br /&gt;
These are verses that describe G-d’s kingship. &lt;em&gt;Imru lefanai malchiyot kedei shetamlichuni aleichem&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;say before Me verses of praise so that you will crown G-d as king over yourselves&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Zichronot&lt;/em&gt; - Rememberance:&lt;br /&gt;
These verses describe fond memories that G-d has of His Holy people of Israel. Say verses of memory - &lt;em&gt;Kedei sheya’aleh zichronchem lefanai l’tovah&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;so that your memory should come up to Me in a good way&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sing&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Shofrot&lt;/em&gt; - from the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;, the ram&#39;s horn, sound.&lt;br /&gt;
These verses reference the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;. In the words of the &lt;em&gt;Gemara&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Ba’meh&lt;/em&gt;, how will you be remembered? You will be remembered through &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, it’s a kind of mysterious three-fold formulation of the day. These three categories of verses end up being the center of gravity around which our prayers on &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; revolve, but why? What does &lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;shofrot&lt;/em&gt;, have to do with this larger idea of &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt; - a day of judgment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems, the prayers aren’t quite what we’d expect them to be when we consider Judgment Day. They seem to see something deeper about this day than simply weighing your deeds and confessing your crimes. Something that has to do with &lt;em&gt;malchiot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shofrot&lt;/em&gt;, Kingship, Memories, and the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;. This is kinda nice, what kind of Judgment Day is it without guilt? And - if none of this is in the Torah - are they making all of this up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;segment-3&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Segment 3 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-3&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at what the Torah itself says, and see if it can give us more clarity on the essence of the day, and maybe help us see what the sages saw that made them understand &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;, our day of Judgment, as a day of kingship, memories, and &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, that description does not reference the idea of a day of judgment at all, instead the Torah characterizes &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; with as a day of &lt;em&gt;Zichron Teruah&lt;/em&gt; - a day to remember the sound of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What exactly does this mean? It seems to be hopelessly ambiguous, a day of remembering the cry of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;. But whatever it means it certainly doesn’t seem to be saying it’s a day of judgment. I mean if you wanted to say it was a day of judgment, just come out and say on the first day of &lt;em&gt;Tishrei&lt;/em&gt;, that’s a &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt; - a day of judgment during which G-d has these scales and weighs the lives of everybody. Instead it is &lt;em&gt;Yom Zichron Teruah&lt;/em&gt; - a day of remembrance of the cry of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;, as if there was some event that we are supposed to remember involving a &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, guess what? There actually was, and the Sages actually tell us exactly what event it was. Listen to the words that we say as part of our &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; prayers right before we actually declare the verses of &lt;em&gt;shofrot&lt;/em&gt; - the verses during which the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; speaks. Here’s the text: &lt;em&gt;Atah nigleita ba’anan kevodecha&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;You, G-d, revealed Yourself in a cloud of glory&amp;quot;; &lt;em&gt;Al am kodshecha&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;to Your holy people&amp;quot;; &lt;em&gt;L’daber imam&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;to speak with them&amp;quot;; &lt;em&gt;Min ha’shamayim hishmatam kolecha&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;from the heavens You made Your voice heard&amp;quot;; &lt;em&gt;V’nigleita aleihem b’arpelei tohar&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;and You revealed Yourself to them in thick clouds of purity&amp;quot;. And when it happened: &lt;em&gt;Gam ha’olam kulo chal mi’panecha&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;the whole world trembled before Your Face&amp;quot;; &lt;em&gt;B’higalotecha Malkeinu al Har Sinai&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot; when You, our King, revealed Yourself on Mount Sinai&amp;quot;. Yes, that’s the event the Torah is talking about. &lt;em&gt;Zichron Teruah&lt;/em&gt; - that is what we’re supposed to remember on &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the memory event in which we first heard the cry of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; - the cry of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; that we all heard, way back at Sinai. If you read the text of revelation at Sinai you’ll find there was a &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; blast there. The sound of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; seems to be what the remembrance of this day is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause here for a second. If it’s really true that on &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; we’re supposed to remember the revelation at Sinai, so the Torah could have just named it &lt;em&gt;Yom Zichron Sinai&lt;/em&gt; - a day of remembering Sinai - that would have been clear enough. However, for some reason, the Torah is emphasizing the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; blast at Sinai as a key part of the experience of revelation. Which is strange, as most of us would say that the main aspect of Sinai is the Torah. Yet, &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; comes along and says, &lt;em&gt;Yom Zichron Teruah&lt;/em&gt;. Which is actually saying that the way to remember Sinai, is when we&lt;br /&gt;
blow the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yom Zichron Teruah&lt;/em&gt;, in essence, that the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; blast is the way you should remember it forever. Why would that be? Why would the sound of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; at Sinai be so important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is revealed in the very first words of that paragraph we’ve been reading, &lt;em&gt;Atah Nigleita&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;You revealed Yourself&amp;quot;. Listen&lt;br /&gt;
to the sentence one more time. &lt;em&gt;Atah nigleita ba’anan kevodecha&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;You revealed Yourself in a cloud&amp;quot;. Strange, that’s an oxymoron. How could G-d have revealed Himself in a cloud? Clouds don&#39;t reveal, they conceal. Even later on in Deuteronomy when we talk about the Sinai experience, we talk about it in terms of &lt;em&gt;Choshech&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;it was dark&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;Anan&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;it was a thick cloud&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;Arafel&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;you couldn’t see a thing&amp;quot;. How disappointing! Here’s the greatest event in the history of our nation, a Divine Revelation shared by the community, and it’s obscured by clouds. It’s like the biggest anti-climax. So what’s going on? How come it was so cloudy? How come it was so dark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually that wasn’t coincidental. There was a reason for that. Later on in Deuteronomy, again talking about the Sinai experience, Moshe picks up on the fact that you couldn’t see anything. He tells the people, &amp;quot;You didn’t see anything at Sinai&amp;quot; - &lt;em&gt;U’temunah einchem ro’im&lt;/em&gt; - there was no vision, there was no picture, nothing to see, &lt;em&gt;Zulati kol&lt;/em&gt; - all there was, was sound. Eventually that sound coalesced into words, and you heard the Ten Commandments, but even before that you heard the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Kol shofar chazak me’od&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;the voice of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; was very loud indeed&amp;quot;. There weren’t any physical &lt;em&gt;shofars&lt;/em&gt; that were blowing at Sinai, what you heard was a supernatural sound. The sound of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; was G-d communicating with you even before He spoke to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was sound the medium through which we encountered G-d, not sight? If you and I could choose to encounter the Almighty with any one of our senses, we probably would choose sight. It’s the most certain way of perceiving something - &amp;quot;I saw it with my own eyes. It&#39;s true!&amp;quot; - and the way we would want to encounter G-d. But sorry folks, that’s not the way it works. You can’t see G-d. Because sight is a sense by which human beings directly encounter something. When you see &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; you perceive &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; directly. Fragile human beings can’t have that direct an experience with the Almighty in this world, they won’t survive. As G-d says to Moshe later: &lt;em&gt;Loh yirani adam v’chay&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;A person cannot see Me and live&amp;quot; through that experience. But you can hear Me, you can hear My Voice. When you hear something that comes from &#39;x&#39;, you don’t perceive &#39;x&#39; directly. You hear an vibration that emanates from &#39;x&#39;, but hearing is still a genuine encounter. It’s the most direct encounter I can provide for you, G-d says, you can encounter Me through My voice, and live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now every year we have &lt;em&gt;Yom Zichron Teruah&lt;/em&gt; - a day of remembering the voice. When we hear the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; it takes us back, it stirs something in our collective human souls. We know that voice. It was the moment we made contact. It’s the moment that changed everything for us. After that moment we could never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That memory of the shofar, of that first encounter with G-d, that actually is the essence of &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;. I’d argue that if we aren’t relating to that, if we don’t remember that core encounter, we’re missing the essence of the day. &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;shofrot&lt;/em&gt;. They are all expressions of that primal encounter with G-d, of the day we first met Him and heard His voice. That’s a very different &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; than the one many of us are used to, but I believe it’s the one the Sages intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;segment-4&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Segment 4 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-4&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have discussed about the real essence of Rosh HaShanah - the memory of our first encounter with G-d, at Sinai. Now we’ll try and examine how the sages understanding of Judgment Day relates to the essence of &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; and the encounter with G-d. I guarantee your &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; will never be the same again. But we still need to answer that gnawing question we’ve had from the beginning: What about this Day of Judgment thing that the Sages talk about, that seems totally unrelated to &lt;em&gt;zichron teruah&lt;/em&gt;, to hearing G-d’s voice at Sinai. Where do they get that from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the sages got it wrong. &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; is judgment day, just, not in the ways we always thought. I want to suggest that the sages knew that the essence of this day is &lt;em&gt;Zichron Teruah&lt;/em&gt;, a day where we remember that close encounter with G-d. But the sages see expressions of that essence as a day of judgment, and as a day that is worthy of declaring G-d’s kingship, a day of memories, and shofar. Let me show you what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put yourself in the shoes of the nation at the moments leading up to Sinai. Imagine hearing G-d’s voice sounding something like a &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;, getting louder and louder. You’re trembling, hearing, and feeling, even seeing - the Torah describes this as total sensory overload, so that they were seeing His voice and not only hearing it. If you encounter G-d, what would that event have meant to you? How would you have processed it, rationally, and emotionally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages give us a guide: &lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shofrot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first heard G-d’s voice, in that instance... you know that there IS G-d. Not just that He exists - I think the generation that went through miracles in Egypt and the splitting of the sea, they knew He existed. But also that there is no denying that knowledge when you encounter G-d directly. At that moment, as we stood in front of G-d, we knew, He is our Lord and our Master, He is our leader, our G-d. This is how &lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt;, at least, is just one expression of The Sinai event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sinai event, the revelation event, what was that really about? One way of thinking about it is that day was the day that we recognized G-d as King. It was, in a word, coronation day. The Torah itself seems to call it that. G-d proposes to Israel this grand bargain at Sinai: &lt;em&gt;Atem tiheyu li mamlechet Kohanim&lt;/em&gt; - you’re going to be a nation/community of priests. No such thing as a community without people, and priests without a Divine Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// &lt;em&gt;A kingdom is a community ruled by a king. A community with a leader is not a kingdom - it is just a functioning community. The kingdom flourishes or descends according to the whims of the king. A community rises or sinks according to the efforts of the leader AND the community. Fascism, and dictatorships, are just kingdoms under a different nomenclature. That is the problem I have with these appelations of king and royalty. It brings in images of gold and jewels, grand castles and produce grand egos, and embedded power structures. We have to find a new language to express this relationship with G-d. I would not call G-d a leader either - that is what Moshe Rabeinu was, He is more, much more, than a leader, or a king. Perhaps it is sufficient to say simply that He is our G-d, and we accept Him as That, Ha&#39;Shem, creater of the Universe, Source of all existence.&lt;/em&gt; //&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accept G-d (as king) is really to accept Him as our Leader. // &lt;em&gt;leader - as the one who guides us along His Path. Difference from the modern spirituality which is to ask G-d for help to follow &amp;quot;my own true path&amp;quot; - not realising that your only true path is His Path.&lt;/em&gt; // It is to make a commitment to follow His Voice, to let Him lead you, and that, of course, was the Sinai experience. We accepted the Torah from G-d, which contained the directives of the Master of the Universe. Our acceptance of these laws indicated our willingness to follow Him, as we considered those laws binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year when we remember that day, when we remember that sound on &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;, we crown G-d anew. It’s a day to declare anew our oath, our binding. We’re just re-enacting what that first moment of meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve explored &lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt;. What about &lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;shofrot&lt;/em&gt; and Judgment Day? How are they expressions of the essence of &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; - of that Divine encounter with G-d?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;segment-5&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Segment 5 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-5&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suggested that &lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt;, declaring G-d’s kingship, is an expression of the idea that we are remembering Sinai. When we hear G-d’s voice, we know He is All-powerful, and thus we tremble in awe as if to royalty. However, this is no mere king, it is the King of the Universe. Could it be that &lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;shofrot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt; are also a reaction to hearing G-d’s voice? Let’s start with &lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt; - memories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What role does memory play in &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;? Does that too take us back to the Sinai experience somehow? Go back to Sinai - really consider that experience. We talked about that experience from the perspective of accepting G-d’s leadership. But, as wonderful as accepting the Torah is, as wonderful as accepting G-d’s kingship is, that event can also provoke a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, you and I, the average, everyday Joe or Jane, who doesn’t experience revelation, live what one might call normal lives. I’m doing my own thing. I was born in San Francisco and then I moved to New York when I was a teenager... I can tell you the whole story of my life, what I’m trying to achieve, what I’m trying to do. I have my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But imagine what happens if Joe or Jane experiences revelation at Sinai. The Being who originated the universe is right here and you are standing around the mountain. It changes everything. Who am I anymore? I am so small in the face of the Master’s immensity. I am so overwhelmed that I am in danger of losing my entire sense of self. What does my little story matter anymore? What significance does it have that I moved to New York when I was thirteen and a half?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the crisis. But if &lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt; provokes that crisis it also contains the seeds of an answer to it and those seeds are known as &lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt; - the notion of G-d’s memories &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/:/akashic.org&quot;&gt;Akashic Records&lt;/a&gt;. Let us explore the idea of memory. What does memory do? What exactly is its function? Well, obviously, memory helps you remember. But memory does far more than that. It’s actually the way we grasp who we are. Our identity itself, the way we understand ourselves, is formed through our memories - the reason being that memory is really about storytelling, about creating a narrative. When you remember things you’re actually connecting the dots between your various experiences, weaving them together to form a tapestry - your story. That’s actually the only way you do remember anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, that means that some points in my life are going to be more important to the story than others. Let’s say I’m a big, fancy investment banker. As I’m rushing out the door to work one morning, on the way out, my seven-year-old daughter spills orange juice on the floor and I need to clean it up before I go to work. That might have been what actually happened, but in the way that I talk to myself about my life, you know it’s a rather disconnected dot, it doesn’t really contribute to the grand story of my life - at least the way I see it. However, the birth of my first child will be a well-connected dot that will contribute greatly to the grand narrative of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, now, there’s another way to think about the crisis of &lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt; that we talked about before. If there really is a King in this universe, maybe there’s a grander story than the one I’m telling myself? Maybe the Creator has a story too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think your life is about your story, and from your perspective when your daughter spilled orange juice that wasn’t a big deal, it was a disconnected dot. But maybe the Creator in His story, maybe He doesn’t think so? Maybe when you stopped and you patiently cleaned up that mess and smiled to your daughter, maybe that was a really meaningful dot? Maybe everything needs to be seen as how it connects to that dot? Maybe your life in the Creater’s view is not just about what a good hedge fund manager you are but how well you balance your career and family? Because if there’s a Creator there is a grand soundtrack out there. There’s a story being told in this universe, and it’s so much larger than just you and me. There’s a grand weave of history and if you could be part of that weave in a meaningful way, if you and your whole life could be a dot that connects in some visceral, significant, redemptive way in the world, how can there be more meaning in life than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We speak about &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; as the beginning of the &lt;em&gt;Yomim Noraim&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;the Days of Awe&amp;quot;. What is awe? We feel awe sometimes when we’re in the presence of something like the Grand Canyon, or when you sit on a grassy knoll looking up at the stars at night. But ask yourself, why do you feel awe? Is it just because you feel like you are small and this is big? I don’t think so. Then you would say, &amp;quot;Okay, fine. So I’m small, and that’s big.&amp;quot; The reason why you feel awe when you have those experiences is because you sense that there might just be a larger story here. And if there is, I have to figure out how I fit because I want to be a part of that larger story. Sure, if you don&#39;t want to you don’t have to - you can continue telling your own story, but at what price?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who read Harry Potter, remember that moment when Harry is at Platform 9¾ and he’s trying to figure out where that train to Hogwarts is. So he’s asking around and he asks somebody, a guy by the name of Joe, and Joe doesn’t know. He says, &amp;quot;I’ve no idea. I’ve never seen Platform 9¾ before&amp;quot;. Imagine you’re Joe. You have your life. You’re doing your own thing, but one day you figure out you’re part of J. K. Rowling’s novel. There’s a creator here and there’s a grand epic story. It’s Harry Potter, and he just bumped into you and asked which way the train was?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in that moment of revelation - revelation itself - when you see the Creator and you realize there’s a grand story here - the Sinai moment as it were - what do you want most deeply? It’s like you could petition the author and ask, &amp;quot;Could I have a more significant role in this story? I don’t want to just be the guy who got bumped into to ask where the train is. How can I help? How can you take my life, my personality, my gifts, my track record, what I’ve done, and weave me into that story?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, on the one hand, the Sinai moment, the encounter with the Kingship, implies &lt;em&gt;Din&lt;/em&gt; - judgment. You’re going to look at my life. You’re going to examine who I am. You’re going to look at my record, what have I done, how I can contribute. But that is a glorious thing that judgment. It’s not judgment in order to be punitive and decide what terrible things you deserve to be subjected to in orderto be paid back for all your sins. No. This judgment is a marvelous opportunity. It’s my opportunity to be a part of the grand unfolding story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// &lt;em&gt;The grander the narrative, the greater the challenges, thus the greater the trials and risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s incredible to think of judgment as an expression of our original closeness with G-d. It’s a thought that gives us great hope. A place that we can leave the guilt of &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; behind, but also approach &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt; with a certain kind of reverence and even joy... It’s an idea that promises to transform how we stand before G-d on &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;segment-6&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Segment 6 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-6&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and over, we’ve asked where the sages got the idea of &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt; from and how it relates to Sinai and now, I think the answer is finally clear: &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; is all about closeness with G-d. &lt;em&gt;Zichron Teruah&lt;/em&gt;, the memory of Sinai, is really about waking up to the fact that G-d is our Master, our Leader, and so we spend time during &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; recognizing G-d’s mastery. But the memory of that encounter also fills us with awe and creates a crisis - G-d is the memory-keeper for all humanity. He is the great storyteller in the sky. How do I fit into His story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// &lt;em&gt;On this plane, it is like working for a year at a company, and doing a &amp;quot;performance review&amp;quot;. Did you achieve your goals set out in the previous review? That is how we mark it here - in the world of measurement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt; is the adult version, and more like, after a year of work at your company, filing documents, landing clients, pursuing marketing campaigns - whatever it is you do at your business - you take a day out each year to look at the corporate mission statement. How do my action align with the corporate goals? It states here we’re pursuing growth, profit - did I make money this year? Great. Check. Let me keep reading... pursue growth while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Hm, how’d I do there? Well, I missed all of my kid’s soccer games. I haven’t been connected with my wife lately. I need to change something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adult version of &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the court case of G-d vs. Rivka Stern, “haul in the scales of sins vs. merits!” - it’s &lt;strong&gt;WHO AM I&lt;/strong&gt;? What does G-d want of me? What is my true mission statement? How do I align with that? What is G-d’s story, and what’s my story? Do they align?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there guilt involved? Yeah, sure. But we’re not meant to worship that guilt. It’s not a blessing to fill yourself up with self-loathing, and the more you hate yourself, the better &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; you will have. If you do that, you’re missing the point. It’s about the encounter with G-d. It’s about closeness. It’s about a relationship. Life is complicated. We have families, we have work, we pursue leisure. Sometimes we forget that G-d wants us to live that life with Him, not around Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are our businesses a part of G-d’s story? How are our families a part of G-d’s story? The simple things that we enjoy - how can we enjoy them together with G-d, as part of our relationship with Him. That’s &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt;. That’s a day of Zichron Teruah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at that teaching again, the one that is the source for &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; all the inhabitants of the earth pass before G-d like “a flock of sheep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the difference now? G-d’s judgment isn’t the great lidless eye of Sauron waiting for you to fail. It’s that of the loving shepherd, who, honestly has a lotta sheep, but is taking the time to tend to each one and making each one of us feel special - making our stories matter. And remember, the Rabbis gave us a verse to support this conception of Din, it was a verse from Psalms, &lt;code&gt;הַיֹּצֵ֣ר יַ֣חַד לִבָּ֑ם הַ֝מֵּבִ֗ין אֶל־כׇּל־מַעֲשֵׂיהֶֽם&lt;/code&gt; - &amp;quot;G-d, the One who forms all of their hearts, who understands all of their actions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not probing our thoughts and our hearts to find our misdeeds. Consider the difference between a judge in a courtroom, and our Judge the Creator. When a person judges you, they don’t know your full story. They don’t know your desires, your passions, your struggles in life, what led you to the moment of “failure”. They judge you on an objective scale, that frankly, isn’t fair. But The Creator? He formed our hearts, He understands the true nature of all of our deeds. He judges us subjectively, and that’s a good thing. That is the judgment of &lt;em&gt;Avinu Malkeinu&lt;/em&gt;, our merciful and loving Father and the all-knowing, all-seeing leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but this conception of &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt; is a very different one than the one I grew up with. So we’re going to spend some time together trying to fuse the &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; we experience every year with this deeper &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; that celebrates our encounter with G-d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this notion of Rosh HaShanah as commemorating Sinai feels too foreign for you and you’re looking for just a little more evidence, I recommend you check out this video of the only recorded Rosh HaShanah celebration in the Torah, and the echos of Sinai you’ll see there. I really recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;segment-7&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Segment 7 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-7&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now we’ve talked about a bit of a paradigm shift from &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; as a scary guilt-fest into something more mature, the memories of that Divine encounter at Sinai, and how those memories produce a sort of &lt;em&gt;Yom HaDin&lt;/em&gt;, causing us to take stock of who we are vis-a-vis G-d, and to do some re-aligning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s only part of the story. &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; is also, essentially, a celebration. It’s a holiday, remember? We’re feasting, we’re partying. It’s not just the solemn task of mission statements, there’s something to be enjoyed about, and I don’t want us to forget it. Remember, the fundamental idea of &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; is remembering that primal encounter with G-d. That relationship itself is worth celebrating. It’s coronation day, remember? We make G-d Lord over us because we’re utterly dumbfounded that the Master of all the Universe should care about us. That the Master Storyteller should weave us, US, into His story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider what that means. If G-d is the great storyteller in the sky, He is shaping the future, determining, yeah, the basic things like health, security, the plight of the sick, the destitute. He is deciding whether the things we pour our lives into should succeed: our careers, our relationships, our dreams. When we pray to G-d, the memorykeeper, the storyteller, we beseech Him to shape our story for good. That’s what so much of our prayer on &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sages tell us how to pray on &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; - through &lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;shofrot&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s revisit those prayers one more time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;malchiyot&lt;/em&gt; - say before Me verses of kingship so that you will crown G-d as king over you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;zichronot&lt;/em&gt; - say verses of memory; remind me of your shared story, remind me of your merits &lt;em&gt;Kedei sheya’aleh zichronchem lefanai l’tovah&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;quot;so&lt;br /&gt;
that your memory should come up to Me in a good way&amp;quot;. So that G-d will incorporate us into His story. The Talmud continues - &lt;em&gt;Ba’meh?&lt;/em&gt; - how will G-d remember us? Through the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shofar has a double meaning for us on this day. On the one hand, we use it to remember G-d’s voice. When we’re in shul on &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;, and we hear the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; being blown, we are transported back to the primal voice. Remember it, and remember all of its implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the sages have us pick up the shofar, not just to remember G-d, but to have Him remember us too. G-d chose to communicate with us wordlessly, at first. So we could just hear His voice and know him. We do the same. We blow our shofar, back to G-d. It is our wordless prayer, a desire to fuse our &lt;em&gt;kol&lt;/em&gt; with his &lt;em&gt;kol&lt;/em&gt;, the perfect union - to join our voices with His voice, to join our story with His story. And in the end, to join our souls with His.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the shofar blows, forget the words to your prayers. What do you want? &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt; is a day of celebration because it celebrates our relationship with G-d. It reminds us that He cares about us enough to hear our voice, to hear our desires, our hopes, our prayers, and to weave them into His story. I don’t know about you, but I think that’s remarkable, it’s awe-inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;segment-8&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Segment 8 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/rosh-hashanah-study-guide/#segment-8&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have a transformed vision of Rosh HaShanah - a day of connection with G-d. But, how can we make these ideas practical? How can we really transform our experience to bring some of these ideas into &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the opportunity to reflect on some of the ideas we’ve been speaking about. Let me ask you some questions that are difficult to answer - that only you will be able to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we recommend grabbing a pen and paper, or opening a new document on your computer. Writing will give you a ritual to force yourself to articulate these thoughts honestly and clearly, and it will also give you something you can come back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But writing is not sufficient. Daily practice, and constant striving to hear the call of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;, is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve thought about our story, and about G-d’s story. But spend today considering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you want your story to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your story, your family’s story, the story of the world? In other words - what will you pray for on &lt;em&gt;Rosh HaShanah&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your story?&lt;br /&gt;
Write a short paragraph encapsulating the story of this past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider: What roles are important to you:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parent? Husband/Wife? Son/Daughter? Boss? Student? Employee? Friend?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider: What events or achievements/failures stood out for you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you proud of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you ashamed of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be specific&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you want your story to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a specific aspect of your story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; W&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we sound the shofar, imagine how far or how close that might be to the sound of G-d&#39;s voice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if you paid attention and focused on your voice, your words, and how close your voice is to G-d’s voice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might you express your emotions if you were in the presence of G-d on this day?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What might your &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt; sound like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the encounter with G-d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you think G-d’s story is?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And think about your life, your story - but from G-d’s perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does your story align with His?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing in front of G-d,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you proud of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you ashamed of?&lt;br /&gt;
Write a short paragraph on your reflections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would your family/friends/community
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;answer the question about G-d’s story?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;answer the questions about your story?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would a conversation like that help your relationships, or your family/community realign around a collective purpose?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<title>Story of the Mekubalim</title>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/story/our_story/#mekubalim-story&quot;&gt;Mekubalim (Story)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mekubalim-(story)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Mekubalim (Story) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/story/our_story/#mekubalim-(story)&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the living messengers of an ancient race of &lt;em&gt;Mekubalim&lt;/em&gt;. We are the receivers, and now we come to deliver our message. It matters not to us whether you hear us and act accordingly or not. For we will continue, as the when we have nothing to receive and our awaiting our next task, we watch, and thus are known as the &lt;em&gt;Neshemot&lt;/em&gt; or Watchers. For many centuries much of our knowledge was hidden, and transmitted in secret to a select few. As it is said, &amp;quot;Speak of the Secrets to one who is learned in all the texts, but never reveal to two&amp;quot;. With the advent of the written word, and much of the knowledge was written down, as the principle of Truth reigns supreme, and both can never lie. Thus the truth will always hide in plain sight. So it was with the messengers of the &lt;em&gt;Mekubalim&lt;/em&gt;, and those who had been trained to read the codes, knew how the disguises were formed, and how to navigate the pathways that our people had placed for us. Thus we could recognise one another just by the way a certain phrase was uttered, or a sentence interpreted. It was like the dancing bears, or the &amp;quot;four-twenty friendly&amp;quot; of the Grateful Dead entourage. During this time, and in various guises our wisdom permeated various cultures, and geographical areas, and laid seeds that would sprout when the environment was conducive to its emergence. Again and again we have called to you. Sometimes in small groups, sometimes in nation states comprising hundreds of millions of people. In this time, and in this place, we begin to transmit once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning it will be brief expose&#39;s. According to your reaction, and to your ability to comprehend what is being said, the appropriate doors will open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more thing. There are two aspects to this check-up. The first is the emperical the second in the imaginative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not healers. There are those who are called to heal, sometimes they are doctors, sometimes they are medicine people. There are those who are teachers, or community leaders. We are not any of those. We are keepers of the Tree of Life. For without the Tree, there is no life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know there are 3 trees in the garden. [Actually four, but the 4th is a secret tree, and because it is secret, we will no longer speak of it]. The Tree of Life, and the Tree of Death, and the Tree of Knowledge (of Good &amp;amp; Evil). And what is evil to the being conscious of being alive? It&#39;s death or anything associated with that, of course. Therefore there are those who work for the Tree of Life, and those who work for the Tree of Death. And the two are eternal enemies. We simply say, that good is to emulate G!d, and evil is to turn one&#39;s back on the Divine expression that not only are we surrounded by, but are also a part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Personal Question: If we are G-d&#39;s psyche having a Divine experience, what is G-d&#39;s need for all this pain and suffering? What does He get from all of this insane hurting of one another?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/story/journey_to_freedom/#good--evil&quot;&gt;Good &amp;amp; Evil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-and-evil&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Good &amp;amp; Evil &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/story/journey_to_freedom/#good-and-evil&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fifteen years old when I was raped. I was walking home one day, when a group of young guys dragged me into a shed and abused me, both sexually and emotionally. It was a terrible experience, but yet, in that awesome place of helplessness and terror, there was a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a point at which I could not longer fight, and had to just submit to survive. At that point, it was like I had left my body, though not completely, because I could still feel, and hear everything that was happening. There was a part of me that was watching, and another that was - how can I say - enjoying it. Even feeding off the energy of the situation - as bizarre as that may seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised then, and have confirmed since, that many, many women (and men) suffer from the - the only word I can use here is juicy - feeling that arises. It is like a feeling of something being nourished. This is where the essential existential issue around sexual activity arises. The assumption/belief is that that which is being nourished is evil, or bad,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it evil? It is one of, if not the primal, source of life (and its experience).&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps one needs to journey to that place, and speak to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and thus needs to be repressed...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an energy. Modern man can think of electricity, primitive man can think of fire, and some can see it in water. But, like all energy it needs to be constrained to be useful, else it will become destructive. We also find that repressed energy will eventually erupt violently. Energy must also be moderated so that the recipient can handle it, and does not &amp;quot;fuse&amp;quot;, or get burnt to ashes, or drown in the tsunami. In fact, it has to be carefully modulated so that it feeds the appropriate amount in the right sequence at the correct time to the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and all this is based on religious doctrine. This is where my the experience turned me, or turned some light on, and I could see something I never saw before. There are religious truths, which are based on a narrative to explain the world we live in, and try and forge ways of living in it in community. And there are spiritual truths, which are based on Truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, my story is based on the fact that I was brutally raped at 15.. and then my subsequent life was built around this seminal fact - upon which my particular story is based. That is the &amp;quot;religious/cultural&amp;quot; context. It was terrible. I was bruised and sore for weeks after. The emotional scars were deep and affected my relationships for the rest of my life. And what did I do to deserve it? I was an innocent girl, and suddenly the evil wolves jumped from between the buildings and attacked me. What G-d, may His Name be raised high, would create this, I have asked, over and over, again? I know many have had similar terrible experiences, some even far worse than what happened to me. But this was my experience, my particular event. I have to own it in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic assumption of human existence is that my life began when I was born. This is ungoldy. Because it ignores the incredible confluence of events that had to gel to make your birth possible. That my awareness of my own life begins when I was born, ignores all the lines that came together to produce this particular minute event in the macrocosm of our universe alone, let&#39;s not take into consideration the whole of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we have a limited view of the totality, we can only see through the window that is availabe to us. If we see trees through the window, we assume that there are trees everywhere, and you see trees when you look through your window. And not only do you see trees, but the natural egoistical assumption is that you see the same trees as me. But from your tower, the landscape might be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a meditation on &lt;em&gt;Netzach&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Hod&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to hide behind a denial - and say well G-d, the all-merciful, the all-seeing un-seen, does not exist. Throw the baby out with the bathwater. But there were elements that were present in that event that were filled with awesome - what? Things that occurred that were not of this world, but felt like they occurred in another... dimension? Could that be. I wanted to say another realm - but that is not accurate. It was a realm that is attached to, is of, this realm, but yet not of it. My body was experiencing the reality of what was happening to it, and I was feeling it, like I was there - but yet, here I was, watching it happen too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians base their religion on the fact that Jesus, the Son of G-d, blessed be His Name, lived and died for our sins. Moslems base it on the fact the Mohammed is a prophet of G-d, may His Name be blessed, Much of the rest is to contextualise the narrative. Jews base their religion on the fact that G-d, may His Name be on my lips for evermore, gave the Jews the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point someone told a story, and enough people believed his story - and a religion is born. The only difference that the Jews claim is that theirs was a communial revelation. The Eastern faiths seems to have permeated more subtly into the people&#39;s mind. But, not being an expert in neither their cultural history nor their faiths, I hesitate to speak to much of them in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the years, I have realised that there are many others of us who have had a seminal event (some a series thereof) that has shaped their lives. It is like we are born a block, almost like piece of clay, that is then shaped by the hand of G-d, may I never forget Your Name, or for some Nature, or Chance, or &amp;quot;Some Thing Else&amp;quot;. But it was not any of us, collectively or separately, that we know! So whatever put me together, before I was raped, is not of this that I know, whatever name I might give it, or not. Perhaps the DNA is that map, just as every seed contains the map for its particular type of tree. Then the elements and environment shape it in according to the particular set of events that it experiences. We see this in the rings of ancient trees that have been cut [and cut and cut, until there will be no ancient trees left].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This horrible event shaped me in the same way. I have seen these twist people into really ugly shapes and I pity them. But I do cannot truly judge them. I can only make sure that it has not twisted me into a pretzel version of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/the_movement/#types&quot;&gt;Types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/the_movement/#the-maccabean-test&quot;&gt;The Maccabean Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tolnet&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;ToLNet &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/the_movement/#tolnet&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sacred communities
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;communites of trust
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;led by truth and true hearts
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;confidentiality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;honour elders, and the gifted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protect the weak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;respect one another and the intimacies we share&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Grow (like vines)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call it a &amp;quot;movement&amp;quot;, because of the language we are using, though it might be better and more simply expressed as the Move. Because, in actual fact, it is a movement - though it is not a horizontal movement, as moving from one home to another - but one could almost think of it as a vertical movement - though that too is not accurate. I would like to express it, and hope that it is, a dimensional move. In essence, it may be expressed as the movement into another dimension. Though that is not 100% accurate. It is the inclusion of the awareness of another dimension, and acknowledgement of those who are able to work with and in that dimension. Listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;types&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Types &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/the_movement/#types&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 2 types of people who joined the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those who were playing out their childhood traumas&lt;/em&gt; - as this space allowed for a wider playing field in which to express these traumas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a natural result of a society becoming more successful and thus more affluent. It allows the inheritors of this affluence a greater sphere of activity, and thus inevitably foster expressions that are challenging to the fabric of the society, and eventually the very fundamental principles upon which it is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those who wished to build a society based on a different, a new narrative&lt;/em&gt;. It was if they had heard something, and were awakened to a vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None were sure what it was - they just new what it &amp;quot;felt&amp;quot; like, or what they dreamed it could feel like. Many of them went in search of this &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;. Some went to the plants to see if they could teach them, some went to the sacred texts and sought answers, some joined cults religious, or otherwise, believing that community was the solution - but it is also the problem. Many believed that the Mother, the earth that nourishes us all, would have the answer - but against the deadly onslaught on everything living that is we are a part of, it is unlikely that there will be any earth left to teach us. We will have turned all the forests into commercial plots by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sat in circles and talked about the vision of the New Earth, and we tried to build communities based on these New Principles, but we inevitably fell back into the patterns we were familiar with, and in all these efforts we saw the same dynamics play itself out - and these were the same dynamics that happened in all groups, whether religious or not, commercial or social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Game has to change&lt;/strong&gt;. With the same volcanic effect that the theories of quantum dynamics had on classical physics. [Perhaps the very term Quantum Physics is an anachronism, like Real TV. Perhaps this &amp;quot;Quantum Physics&amp;quot; is not physics at all, as everything it talks about is non-physical actually. Yet it does a good job of &amp;quot;proving&amp;quot; its reality. In the same way, if the Shaman could produce results that could be emperically measured (according to the accepted, standard measurments - those measurements that are acceptable to the accepted rules of measurement. This is the same as the impact of a new legal system on indigenous people - which needs always to be backed up by military power) who now have to accept new measurements of social behaviour imposed by the ruling class (which is what actually makes them the &amp;quot;ruling class&amp;quot; - not any inherint human characteristics. Which is why we have more popular respect for the successful entrepeneur, rather than the privileged noblesse. We look at them with the fascinated stare of the mouse watching the snake as it slithers towards it, hoping that it will strike the mouse frozen beside it. We know that these people have the ability to destroy our lives in a moment if they so wish. We fight to hold back their desire to control everyone and everything. But we must remember that they are just scared of the Divine nature of the universe and themselves - which is the last thing they will be able to acknowledge, having spent their entire existence catering to the emperical (measurable according to standard accepted measurements) human nature of their being. And this is an attempt to build walls around the terror of extinction, of not being anymore, forgotten in the ashes of time. So they need to build huge edifices to their greatness, pyramid and towers. They have to fight great wars and accomplish grandiouse (and often idiotic) things - to impress everyone, and everyone can applaud their greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I ask you O great ones who rule over us and wish to control us like ants, like little slaves to do their bidding, and feed their petty, mostly material, desires with our juices - how large is your pyramid next to the giant nebula that gaze upon us in pity? If you are remembered for a 1000 years, O my Emperor, how long is that in the eyes of our very planet, which your science says has been here for 15,000,000,000 years? Well, I say, however, or whatever built this planet, is going to be remembered for far longer than any one of you will be. And is capable of producing things far greater than any of you, or your wizards, whether of science or magic, could ever hope to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The beauty of this strange Viral time is that it is clearly showing the difference between these two.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The underlying philosophy of non-violence is that the people have more power than their government, but must connect with each other in order to mobilize that power.”&lt;br /&gt;
--Kusum Singh: Mass Communication without Mass Media: Gandhi’s message to a violent world&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-net-of-indra&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Net of Indra &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/quotes/#the-net-of-indra&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Net of Indra is a profound and subtle metaphor for the structure of reality. Imagine a vast net; at each crossing point there is a jewel; each jewel is perfectly clear and reflects all the other jewels in the net, the way two mirrors placed opposite each other will reflect an image ad infinitum. The jewels in this metaphor stand for an individual being, or an individual consciousness, or a cell, or an atom, or a crystal. Every jewel is intimately connected with all other jewels in the universe, and a change in one jewel means a change, however slight, in every other jewel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen Mitchell, The Enlightened Mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Jewel of Indra, the network as I envisage it. I believe that by creating and activating the structure, the most amazing things will happen. Once someone who believed they were disempowered suddenly becomes empowered, the energy that will be released will be so incredible we need just step back and let it do its work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Decide to network
    Use every letter you write
    Every conversation you have
    Every meeting you attend
    To express your fundamental beliefs and dreams
    Affirm to others the vision of the world you want
    Network through thought
    Network through action
    Network through love
    Network through the spirit
    You are the center of the world
    You are a free, immensely powerful source
    of life and goodness
    Affirm it
    Spread it
    Radiate it
    Think day and night about it
    And you will see a miracle happen:
    the greatness of your own life.
    In a world of big powers, media, and monopolies
    But of six billion individuals
    Networking is the new freedom
    the new democracy
    a new form of happiness.
    -- Robert Muller
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Muller is the former Assistent Secretary-General of the United Nations and is now Chancellor, UN University for Peace, Costa Rica. He wrote the poem for Jessica Lipnack and Jeffrey Stamps in honour of their book, &lt;em&gt;Networking: The First Report and Directory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading a through his ideas, there are some that are excellent. His ability to think in global terms, analysing many of the large scale issues that need to be dealt with, is commendable. To that end, it was be beneficial to us all if these ideas were to be implemented. However I question his uncompromising support for a form of World Government based upon the current political and economic framework. The Government could turn out to be even more distant from the average person, the citizens. It could become another form of the present government, only perhaps larger and more bureaucratic and politicized, and even more unaccountable. How tedious the process of change or agreement or action would be? How distant, how unaccountable would that body be in the end, to the average person. And once set in motion, how incredibly difficult it would be to change any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point is that in order to have a world government we would need a global community that required and participated and supported and interfaced with it. This is essentially the concept of the Tree of Life Network. This is a vision of a manner to weave a more dynamic, better connected and more responsive global community that will form the foundation of this World Government.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>4d-Vision</title>
		<link href="https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/4d-vision/"/>
		<updated>2021-08-21T16:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/4d-vision/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-vision&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Vision &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/4d-vision/#the-vision&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is this vision, that I speak of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the 4th dimension! To unpack this statement more fully, will take a certain amount of training in the language. Hopefully &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/4d-vision/dimensions.html&quot;&gt;these explanations&lt;/a&gt; will help. You can of course just &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/....&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain from a more humanistic level. We live in a world that we call 3 dimensional. A world that has length, breadth and depth/height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;It is interesting to note that perspective. We have only length - short or long. We could say shortness instead, and do sometimes, but shortness means a very brief length. We never think of long as a very long shortness. Also in its very grammer one can see a difference. Length is a state of something, whereas shortness is a description of a state of something, length is the the measurement of something, and is often called distance - which just clarifies the equivalent adjectival use of long and short. Similarly with breadth and her twin width - which is identical to the constellation of length, and had wide (though not wideness). Though breadth could be looked at as derivative or secondary, as breadth does imply some measurable distance, though distance does not necessarily imply any measurable breadth. Finally, we have depth, which is makes it clear that this is from the perspective of a point or plane of origin, for it implies an above and below.

Before delving into that, let me note that both length and breadth also contain points of origin by implication, something which is not obvious upon speaking of length. Let me explain. Length is easy. It implies a beginning and an end point (and by implication a midpoint - all the rest are debatable). The beginning (or any other point on the line) could be taken as the point of origin. Though, we normally speak of the distance between two points as being the length. I could now speak of breadth in the same manner, but I wish to take you on a slightly different path. Though breadth/width is often thought of in linear terms, i.e. the width of the tunnel, or the breadth of his reach, it is actually more representative of a circle, and thus it becomes actually &amp;quot;the midpoint of the linear measurement of the width of the channel is the &amp;quot;moving point of the center of the circle that is defined by the breadth of the midpoint upon which it moves&amp;quot;. If this channel is uniform, as a highway, then one can measure the breadth by measuring the radius of the circle that is bounded by the width of the road, and you will have your breadth, and your point of origin. One speaks of the average width of a river, that it is narrow at some places and broad at others. But with depth, there is always a height, a dynamic, an up or a down!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call it the world of measurement, though more often it is called the emperical world, or more scientificially: based on emperical evidence - which just means &amp;quot;measurable&amp;quot;, or more accurately, &amp;quot;objectively&amp;quot; measurable. In the beginning, we had our senses, and they consisted of 5 measuring instruments, our 5 senses. Interestingly enough, during that &amp;quot;primitive&amp;quot; (I prefer early) period, we also have records of other senses, which have been largely discredited in our modern era. But that is really &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/4d-vision/neshama.html&quot;&gt;another topic&lt;/a&gt;. Even those five have been reduced to the three above dealing almost exclusively in identifiable objects and surfaces in our explorations of our surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;with the demotion of smell, and taste (touch, which has been slowly removed, cannot be exclusively denied, as it is a constant of our existence, and is, in fact, one of our primal senses, together with smell and taste - all 3 of which have been largely superceded by the commercialisatory forces. Taste by sugar &amp;amp; salt and other flavouring; smell by perfumes and deodorants (and now in foods too); touch with the synthetic materials that &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; like the real thing, with sexual mores, and other such manipulable fashions
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

		<title>4th dimensional entities</title>
		<link href="https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/4d-entities/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;123-and-4d-entities-(qkab)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;1,2,3 &amp;amp; 4d entities (qkab) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/qkab/4d-entities/#123-and-4d-entities-(qkab)&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the story consisted of 1d entities - who were never seen, only whose presence was able to be detected. There were many stories of their influence, but no-one is certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2d&#39;s - all over the place, from virii, to insects. Imagine a 2d encountering a 3d. All it will see are the bottom of your boots - from the side. In fact, if you take a step, it will be almost magic to him, for your boot will dissapear - if he is lucky, he will have a glimpse of the sole of your boot, and then reappear somewhere else, probably a decent distance away for him, but for you, it was just a step. Your voice will come from the &amp;quot;heavens&amp;quot; (G-d knows where that is!) - but somewhere &amp;quot;above&amp;quot; him - if he even has the concept of above, otherwise he will percieve it all around him. You kindly kneel down to show him yourself, but this wierd visage, something he could never recognise, let alone describe will suddenly appear close to him, perhaps as large as a mountain. As he has no depth perception or, for the sake of our story, very limited ability, he will only see a partial image of your visage. Something like those sculptures of a face emerging from a rock. I do not think it will assuage his terror at your appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3d&#39;s - to the 3d&#39;s you are like an ant, or worse, he might not even be able to perceive you, as he has limited 2d perception - though I propose his consciousness is 2d, though the reality that he live in is 3d. He needs to be trained to live from a 3d perspective and is not necessarily more effective than a 2d entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then above 3d, we encounter, or are &amp;quot;under&amp;quot; 4d, something we can only intuit, but not perceive - as we do not have 4d consciousness. But you have to remember something about consciousness - it is like a wave, and thus is an expression of energy, and energy is infinite in expression. That is, it can and will express itself anywhere. In other words, it will find and outlet, using whatever material is available to express itself. The only manifestation will be like the &amp;quot;waves on the ocean&amp;quot;, soundless but full of sensation/feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every sensation you feel, every thought you are conscious of, every heartbeat is an expression of the energy that permeates - nay, Is - the entire existence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/journey/#heros-journey&quot;&gt;Hero’s Journey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/journey/#the-template&quot;&gt;The Template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hero&#39;s-journey-greater-see-(journey)..tolnetorganisations.mdour-journey&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Hero’s Journey -&amp;gt; see (Journey)[../tolnet/organisations.md#our-journey] &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/journey/#hero&#39;s-journey-greater-see-(journey)..tolnetorganisations.mdour-journey&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin on the inside, awakening to consciousness, slowly gaining awareness the world around us. As time goes by, we reach a level of cognition from and of our environment, and its topology. Our journey actually begins at this stage, and it might take many years, but the portal is an awareness of the other AND the effect we are having on the world around us. The end of the journey is of-course unattainable – and this is to be fully conscious of our world, both inner and outer, and the effect we have upon it. Then beings the hero’s journey into the inner reaches of your own self – what we call the soul, the Nefesh - that which I am in the world around me. But that is not the cause, not the first cause, and you begin to understand that as you head deeper into the reaches of your inner being. where you encounter forgiveness and responsibility. That you are responsible for what is happening in your life, and you also need to be responsible for what has happened in your life. You need to forgive yourself for what you have done that was not true to your inner purpose and will – as in &lt;em&gt;“Thy will be done, in heaven as on earth”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, perhaps, you will be allowed into the next room in the palace. This is the place of the higher soul or spirit – Ruach, as if you have reached the throne room, where you encounter the breath (voice?) of the Divine, the all-powerful King of the Universe. It is then that you begin to experience awe and deep understanding of how it is all connected and full of spirit. Finally, you may be gifted with a glimpse of the Holy of Holiest, until you have realised that we are all part of a purpose that is so beyond purpose that it leaves you breathless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-template&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Template &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/journey/#the-template&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need to understand, truly understand is that there is a template within which each one of us is born. It is commonly called your body.[^6] It is the skin, the barrier, that divides the inside from the outside. And the place where we live is inside this “external” template.[^7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I say that there is a template? Generally, each one of us has, within certain extremes, the same physical template – differing only in some details – like colour of hair, eye-shape, size, height, etc. There are only very occasionally aberrant outbursts, but nothing truly untoward. Nor can our knees go backward, or do we have a hand on our stomachs. Each one of us is formed from the same template, perhaps you can think of it as the same idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is repeated, perhaps infinitely, out and in, above and below, large and small. Each atom is made from a template, which is quite well described nowadays. The galaxies are formed in similar ways, and gravity is gravity, however you interact with it. And we, and all of life, in fact, all of creation exist within the constraints of this template. That we cannot change. But we can be whatever we wish within the spaces of this template. That is the place of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eat to feed the body. Food cannot feed the soul. It is our relationship with the food that will nourish the soul. Our “affinity” to it. Thus it is with everything that we interact act with. If we have a “soul-full” relationship with it, then it can satisfy the needs of our soul. If not , then it is available to feed &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/journey/sitra_achara.html&quot;&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt; – like the banana peels, which you trash, that you throw out your car window. Where it goes we can speak of at another time, for that is not the topic under discussion, but that of creating the seeds of the web that we speak of as these are the heart spaces from which these seeds will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we step into the physical reality that we exist in, is by commitment. For commitments define the lines upon which our structures are founded. Commitments used to be made with the spoken word. In the days when all a man had was his reputation which relied on his words – as much as his actions, we called it oaths and vows. In fact creation begins with words “And he said... let there be light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have commitment, (the framework)[tol-framework.html] can be built, which we have named “The Tree of Life Network. The covenant we are asked to accept is one of life – to nourish, protect, sustain all life. The commitment that you make is to the task of building a peaceful global nation, in which the majority of its population are living comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first task we need to perform is the calling. This is to make a connection with others who share our world view - one in which we believe that every relationship is sacred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spiritual flame shows people how to act in a way that is more aligned with their experience of the Sacred.8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the quintessential element in this time that needs repairing is our relationship with our Mother Earth – though not the only factor – however, let us start there. That will bring us to the beginning - our food. That which the Mother offers us and provides us, as long as we honour her – as is said in the litany: “If you will follow My commandments, you will have rain in the season, and your crops will grow, and your trees will bear fruit.” As long as the flame burns, so it provide nourishment to the body and the spirit of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey starts from first principles. That first principle says that we are made both of body and of spirit. It is an acknowledgement of Spirit. Once we acknowledge that, we can then begin to investigate the Sciences of the Sacred. I am blessed to be the recipient of this Wisdom of our Ancestors.&lt;br /&gt;
Building&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin to build these communities, communities of communities. Call them sacred communities, or support groups, companies or whatever else you wish. I would like to call them “Communities of Truth”. These communities are made up of affinity groups. Small groups of people who are willing to make a commitment to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a small commitment. To help out at a shelter, or to fix a shed, cook a meal for a sick person... If you can rely on a person’s word, you will begin to trust them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like starting a business, or a company.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Chasidic%20Master%20-%20Parashat%20Balak/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Chasidic%20Master%20-%20Parashat%20Balak/#pleasure-as-displeasure&quot;&gt;Pleasure as Displeasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Chasidic%20Master%20-%20Parashat%20Balak/#in-the-fortieth-year&quot;&gt;In the fortieth year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Chasidic%20Master%20-%20Parashat%20Balak/#footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When a person feels an attraction towards something, he can then make contact with its core, its very soul – the divine desire to be.[^1] But only if he experiences divine pleasure in its being,[^2] will he achieve the true fulfilmint of his desire, to touch its soul.&lt;br /&gt;
However, the degree and intensity of this pleasure is governed by the object of desire’s place in the chain.[^3] The more spiritual the thing that is desired is,[^4] the more fulfilling will be the pleasure it yields – for it is closer to the source of all pleasure.[^5]&lt;br /&gt;
The ultimate experience of pleasure lies in the experience of union with the Source, where pleasure resides in its most pristine form.[^6]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pleasure-as-displeasure&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Pleasure as Displeasure &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Chasidic%20Master%20-%20Parashat%20Balak/#pleasure-as-displeasure&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its lowest reaches, the Chain of Evolution[^7] yields things that are inconducive[^8] – or even contrary – to what G-d desires.[^9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^10]The capacity of these things to give pleasure is an existential paradox. All pleasure is but the embodiment of the divine pleasure in creation, while these pleasures are divine &lt;strong&gt;dis&lt;/strong&gt;pleasures – things contrary to creation.[^11] Yet they, too, are products of the divine desire, since their capacity to give pleasure fills a certain function in G-d’s purpose in creation: G-d desired that we be confronted with a choice between good and evil (so that our deeds should be meaningful and significant). But G-d wants that these things should exist only in order that man should reject them as contrary to His very; so theirs is an existence whose inner essence – those function and raison d’ētre – is not to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us use the metaphor of digestion to explain the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digestion is the process by which food passes through the various organs which break it down and separate its finer elements from its coarser ones. At each phase of the process, this separation grows more and more defined; ultimately, the finer elements in the food evolve into body-building cells and energy, and its coarser elements are ejected by the body. Both the nutrients and the waste are products of the digestion system; but the former is generated to be used, while the latter is generated to be rejected and therby enable the body’s absorption of the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the same token, the Chain of Evolution is like the cosmic “digestive system” in which the essence of creation is processed into the substance and the energy of the universe that G-d desired. This process (like every process we know) also generates waste – elements that must be separated and disposed of in order for the desirable product to function.[^12]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Of course, G-d could have evolved His world in such a manner that the good develops without any separation of waste, or, for that matter, He could have not evolved it at all. But G-d desired that the good in creation should be all the more sharply defined by its contrast with the rejected evil; that human life should be an exercise in refinement – in distinguishing between the calories of divine energy and the sludge of putrid waste in our own self and character, our environment and our world. Indeed, the very concept of good, as we know it, would be devoid of all meaning were it not for the challenge of rejecting the evil that vies for validation and indulgence.)[^13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^14]Based on the above, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, explains the following incident related in the Talmud:[^15]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, Rabbi Yehushua and Rabbi Akiva were walking along the road when they heard the sounds of the crowds of Rome in the distance. They began to weep, but Rabbi Akiva laughed.&lt;br /&gt;
Said they to him: “Why are you laughing?”&lt;br /&gt;
Said he to them: “Why are you weeping?”&lt;br /&gt;
Said they to him: “These barbarians, who prostrate themselves before statues and sacrifice to idols, dwell happy and secure, while we – the footstool of our G-d (i.e. the Holy Temple in Jerusalem) was consumed by fire. Shall we not weep?”&lt;br /&gt;
Said he to them: “That is why I am laughing. If for those who transgress His will it is so, how much more so is it for those who do His will.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(Talmud, Makkot 24a-b)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Akiva is saying: If the waste produced by the divine desire in creation can yield such pleasure for the hedonist, imagine the pleasure to be derived through the fulfillment of His will, which is the source of all pleasure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-fortieth-year&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;In the fortieth year &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Chasidic%20Master%20-%20Parashat%20Balak/#in-the-fortieth-year&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therein lies the deeper significance of the idolatory (of &lt;em&gt;Peor&lt;/em&gt;)[^16], and the explanation of why the people succumbed to it on the eve of their entry into the Land of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, the idol worship (of &lt;em&gt;Peor&lt;/em&gt;) was a particularly repulsive activity. In truth, however, this was but the physical encoachment of what a person does every time he prefers an unG-dly pleasure over a G-dly one: he is worshipping the offal of creation, venerating something whose only significance is its need to be rejected in favour of the energies that are extracted from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the vulnerability (to &lt;em&gt;Peor&lt;/em&gt;) came about at the close of their forty-year sojourn in the desert, as they camped on the east bank of the Jordan River poised to enter and settle in the Land of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For forty-years, the people had enjoyed a wholly spiritual existence. They were fed, clothed and sheltered by daily miracles, leaving them free to pursue the divine wisdom of the Torah, without the distractions of the material state. Most telling of their state was the fact that the mann, the “bread from heaven” on which they lived, was wholly absorbed into their bodies, engendering no waste. They inhabited a spiritual idyll, in which the waste of creation was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now they stood at the threshold of a new era: they were about to settle the land, till its soil, engage in commerce and polotics – i.e., to live a physical life sustained by physical means. For the first time in their history as a nation, they were to be in direct contact with the nether levels of the Chain of Evolution – with that part of the cosmic digestive tract which sperates the waste from the body of creation. For the first time, they were called upon to differentiate between vital matter – matter that nourishes a spiritual end – and dead matter – matter as an end in itself.[^17]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all were equal to the challenge. There was an outbreak of &lt;em&gt;Peor&lt;/em&gt; worship[^18] in the camp, as many were enticed by the psuedo-pleasures to be found in the undesirable by-product of creation. Until one man – Pinchas – came, and with his selfless commitment, unclouded vision and decisive action, put a halt to the plague of &lt;em&gt;Peor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every piece I read brings up many thoughts. I could spend the whole day working on a piece like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;footnotes&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Footnotes &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Chasidic%20Master%20-%20Parashat%20Balak/#footnotes&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: It has been called the “quantum flirt” in some circles. The object stares back – we do not only notice the object, but the object also wants to be noticed. In some strange sense, in this more subtle realm, the looking (wanting to see) is a form of entanglement.&lt;br /&gt;
[^2]:&lt;br /&gt;
Here it slips in the word divine – and the reader might skip over the discomfort of once again having to think in terms of G-d – the divine. In this time, we have muddied the waters of the divine, and no longer are satisfied with a pristine use of the concept, put have to fling it around as if handed a hot potatoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Immediately, a reaction of “I don’t believe in religion, and thus God. Instead I believe in “all my relations” and “Great Spirit”; or “Mohammed, the Holy Prophet” and Allah. Or: it doesn’t matter what you call it, call it God, Allah, Buddah, Holy Spirit, Jehovah, etc., etc., etc. But, if you cannot accept G-d, then how cnn you actually accept Allah, or Great Spirit? For is it not the same thing? And you might enter and call It by a different name, but It is the same It, the “I am that I am!” of eternal being.

But that is not what I wished to emphasise here, but just to underline the use of the adjective divine, meaning spiritual, i.e. filled with spirit. If the pleasure is not spiritual that you seek, it will then be attracted to and by objects that are on the same lower, denser, and more beastly level – what one would call the level of idolatory – which is to pray to idols – the lower, base manifestations of the divine! What we refer to as the Beast.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^3]: What would oppose that is, upon making contact with its soul and core, the desire to destroy it – or lead it into darkness. It is as if they need to feed off this life force, this divine desire to be. They take no pleasure in its being, but only in its demise.&lt;br /&gt;
[^4]: And the more spiritual the desire for the object is!&lt;br /&gt;
[^5]:&lt;br /&gt;
It is also know that below a certain threshold, more of this thing will not bring more pleasure – but probably more pain i.e. will end up increasing the pain in the world, instead of the spirituality. (torture/blood/ritual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;These are the finite things for which we can have infinite desire, for no matter how much we desire them, no matter how much we feed on them, they will not be able to satisfy this hunger – for it is a spiritual hunger, a hunger that will only be assuaged by things that contain the essence of the divine in them. (children?)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^6]: Before merging fully with the pleroma.&lt;br /&gt;
[^7]:&lt;br /&gt;
Analysis:&lt;br /&gt;
(i) If we imagined a chain, it has a beginning, source, and an end. Thus the end would be defined as the point furthest away from the source. Furthest in this sense would mean the most unlike the source. Something like the broken telephone. The further away from the source of the message, the more the message drifts from its original. Or if you imagined the light as the source, then it would be darkness on the other end. If it was life, then death would be the end.&lt;br /&gt;
(ii) But what we are talking about here is process or chain of evolution from the source of evolution itself. Thus it must evolve from something to something else – and the only place the unity, perfection can move to, is the opposite of everything that it is.&lt;br /&gt;
(iii) Thus this evolution becomes an evolution from the source to whatever the source is not, and thus it becomes inconducive to whatever radiates along this chain of evolution.&lt;br /&gt;
(iv) Thus if we name the Source, G-d, then the statement of whatever G-d desires, is inconclusive. Because this very chain of evolution is G-d’s desire. For nothing can exist without G-d wanting it to exist. Thus, it is not contrary to G-d’s desires, unless we interpret G-d’s desire to be what radiates from the Source, and thus as it gets further and further from the Source, it begins to contain less and less of it and thus is less able to conduct the “desire”.&lt;br /&gt;
(v) Remember, this is not spatial, although we have to use spacial constructs to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^8]:&lt;br /&gt;
It is similar to the process of conductivity. If we think of the Divine Energy as electricity, and it needs a conductive material to flow. If there is a non-conductive part of the path along which it wishes to flow, there will be a blockage – and eventually damage at that point.&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps we are holders/bearers of Light. Thus bound in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^9]: What G-d desires: Or “the will of G-d”. If we live according to the “will”, i.e. laws, of the universe our lives will no doubt be easier!&lt;br /&gt;
[^10]: Interestingly enough, this is what happens to those who begin to descend into the darkness. Like those who are depressed, suicidal, in despair. When feeding from something external and thus material (idolatory), the loss of this external manifestation will bring about a spiritual crises.&lt;br /&gt;
[^11]: If creation is the will to live, then they are the expression of the will to destroy/kill/annihilate.&lt;br /&gt;
[^12]: They are like the viruses, errors in the DNA/RNA production system of the body.&lt;br /&gt;
[^13]: There is also a metaphor of electricity that we could use here.&lt;br /&gt;
[^14]: Here in this case, when we speak of Rabbi’s, we are speaking of people who have studied and practised their faith all their lives. People of similar ilk exist in all cultures, religions and societies. Thus this is a story of Rabbi’s, but they could be Buddhist monks, or Sufi imams, or Christian priests. One could begin the story, three wise men were ...&lt;br /&gt;
[^15]:&lt;br /&gt;
Before we continue to the story below, as my intention for this teaching is for it to accessible to as broad an audience as possible. Thus in the usage of some archetypes, we use a word that is common to our culture. However, we do not wish to restrict it only to that context. If we speak of G-d, we think of G-d as both transcendent and immenent, as the One that is everything, everywhere and without whom nothing would exist. It could be Ha’Shem, Jehovah, the Holy Spirit, Allah, the Source, the Creator, Great Spirit, Buddha, Jesus, the Holy Prophet, blessed be His name, and the names of all the prophets. These all call to that infinite Being that cannot be named by any name, by is called by all names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;If we refer to anthing or anyone, include G-d, in a particular gender it is not to diminish any other. We could play the game of using She instead of He, or even It. But It is neither He nor She nor It. But we are restricted and constrained by the terms and manner of the language and its cultural norms. In English, we could use It. However, in Hebrew, there is no it – thus G-d is either He or She... and they chose He! Now we can turn all the He’s into She’s and then the gender problem will be solved....

The debate over gender is only pertinent with the background of gender discrimination in a society. It has no intrinsic effect on that. Perhaps we have a bible that contains He and another version that uses She instead. The first is used by the men, and the second by the women. BTW, if that was done in the Hebrew bible, it would require the verbs to be changed to the feminine form in these cases too.

I would rather seek to understand what we mean when we use He and what aspect of G-d are we expressing when we use the feminine pronoun. Let us explore deeper the feminine expression of G-d, and then only change those. We could possibly continue to use the masculine form of the verb, as is often done in modern Israel, with the feminine pronoun. I have to point out that there are many commentaries, some relying on the Gematria (numeration) of verses to derive certain conclusions. Many of these would no longer be relevant if we amended the text. Finally, how are you ever going to convince us to change a text that is millinia old?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^16]: I parenthise this, because although the story might be familiar to all those who have read and studied Torah, to those less familiar with the story, the tale of the Israelites falling into idolatory on the eve of their entry into the Holy Land – speaks to me of the need for vigilance, especially when close to your goal, is the time for the enemy to strike.&lt;br /&gt;
[^17]: This is the material for which we can have infinite desire, infinite appetite, but will never satisfy our souls.&lt;br /&gt;
[^18]: &lt;em&gt;Peor&lt;/em&gt; Worship: Idolatry, harlotry, and matriarchy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#our-journey&quot;&gt;Our journey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#sacred-communities&quot;&gt;Sacred communities.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#temple-meeting&quot;&gt;Temple meeting&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#start-with-the-food--water&quot;&gt;Start with the food &amp;amp; water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#collaboration-not-competition&quot;&gt;Collaboration, not competition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-of-trust&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Web of Trust &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#web-of-trust&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All organisations consist of a webs of trust that are interacting with other webs. These webs are made up of affinity groups. This affinity can be on many different levels. It could be financial, it could be familial, it could be philosophical, cultural, or religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your friends, for instance. The people you are close to, and whom you share parts of your life. They form an affinity group that you are part of. That group might be connected to another pod in a web that might consist of an organisation like a department in a university, or a project team that are part of a project that is occurring in a corporation, and so on outwards, further and further.&lt;br /&gt;
We are all connected via these strands that connect us all, making the tapestry of our lives and the human race itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is so, you might ask, then what is the element that we speak of that we would like to insert into this web within web that already exists? It is one of consciousness. Of becoming conscious of these interactions, and what is occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many articles that have been written about these webs since the WWW arose. They explore this concept that all organisational structures, structures that manifest a certain coherency, and thus are all networks of some form. Webs are networks, trees are networks, blood vessels are networks, lungs are networks, even forests consist of webs of interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-journey&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Our journey &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#our-journey&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journey begins on the inside, with the inner &lt;strong&gt;‘I’&lt;/strong&gt;, consistent with the view that we need to manifest our spiritual aspect in the material realm of consensual reality, rather than the other way round. This requires us first to awaken and become more consciousness of the effect we are having on the world around us. Thus begins the hero’s journey into the inner reaches of your own self – what we call the first soul, the &lt;em&gt;Nefesh&lt;/em&gt;. That &lt;strong&gt;‘I’&lt;/strong&gt; that I am in the world around me. However that is not the cause, not the first cause, and you will begin to understand that as you head deeper into the reaches of your inner being. There you encounter both forgiveness and responsibility. That you have to take responsibility for your part in the things that have happened, and what is presently happening in your life – not the things you have no control over, but those that you do. Nevertheless, most certainly, you need to take full responsibility for your relationship with the “inevitable” events of your life.1 Those that seem to be part of your destiny. And believe me they are! For each one of us has a purpose, some big, some “small”, but just as it takes a village to make a village, so it will take the entire human population to fashion a global community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you need to forgive yourself for what you have done that was not true to your inner purpose and will – as in “Thy will be done, in heaven as on earth”. This is the place of the second soul – Ruach. That is when you enter the court and there encounter the breath of the Divine Creator, the one we call King. It is when you begin to experience awe and deep understanding of how it is all connected, and that we are all part of a purpose that is so beyond purpose that it leaves you breathless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need to understand, truly understand is that there is a template within which each one of us is born – we can even refer to as a Space – a space that has been granted each of us, and in this space we are “divine”. We have been granted the right to do with it what we wish. Pollute it, destroy it, allow others to violate it. In this realm, we call it our body – the material manifestation of this space. It consists of the skin, the barrier, that divides the inside from the outside. Yet it is some-where in this body, in this space, that our consciousness lives. Where is this place? Each of us is an version of this template, both inside and outside. Each one of us is formed from the same template, perhaps you can think of it as the same idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This continues out and in, above and below, large and small. Each atom is made from a template, whose measurements and behaviour we think, are quite well described nowadays. The galaxies are formed in similar ways, and gravity is gravity, however you interact with it. But how accurate is our description or knowledge of what it actually is?2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, human beings, and all of life, in fact all of creation, exist within the constraints of this template. That we cannot change.3 But we can be whatever we wish within the spaces of this template – the space of which we are conscious. That is the place of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eat to feed the body. Food cannot feed the soul. It is then our relationship with the food that will feed the soul. Our affinity to it. So it is with everything that we interact act with. If we have a “soul- full” relationship with it, then it feeds our soul. If not , then it goes to some other place... what that is we can speak of at another time, for that is not the topic under discussion, but that of creating the seeds of the web that I wish to speak of. These are the heart spaces from which these seeds will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commitment is to step into the physical reality that we live in. They define the lines, the limits, which form the foundations upon which our structures rely. Commitments used to be made with our word - we called them oaths and vows, when all a man had was his word. In fact creation begins with words “And He said... let there be light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have commitment, we can begin building the Tree of Life, from whose fruit new life will be seeded. If we make a commitment to connecting with others who believe that every relationship is sacred. A sacredness that comes from the awareness of the Oneness of everything, expressed in knowing that everything is connected. That everything you do has consequences, and nothing exists in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sacred-communities.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sacred communities. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#sacred-communities.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the centre of the community, it core, so to speak will be a space, which is designated as the Temple, and it is dedicated to Truth. It also carries the creed of “peace before truth”. Speak only if necessary, maintaining essential silence. And if you speak, consider the effect of your words. But if you do speak, speak only the truth – or else pray instead for forgiveness and mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the centre, the pillar around which all will stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sacred space, the deeper the truth spoken, the more we can know the person who speaks. In this way we create a communal space, within which to recognise the areas of positive resonance, and the work/service necessary to enable, support and encourage the manifestation of those areas in the lives of those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talk nowadays of the ideal way of life. There is a huge debate on what makes the ideal lifestyle.[^4] On the physical side, it might be to have lots of money, and a big house and a nice car and a lovely wife and good children.&lt;br /&gt;
On the emotional side it is to have a loving family and caring supportive community. On the mental side, is to do something meaningful or challenging. On the spiritual side, it is to be honour, obey and serve the Divine, both within and without.[^5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this plethora of information, many people are starting to ask difficult questions about the fruits of this way of life that we are in, or heading towards, realise that something needs to be done to change the direction we are heading in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may be feeling totally overwhelmed, and disempowered. This is because there are still not enough of us. The “thoughts” have not yet reached critical mass. Similar to what nutritionists tell us. Even though we know we should not eat “bad” food, we still indulge, even over-indulge – until we encounter a health crises. That is the difference between knowing and doing. It is made up of “I can’t because ...” Let us stand up, all of us that believe in a different way of living, and relating to the earth, and begin to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;temple-meeting&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Temple meeting &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#temple-meeting&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start each meeting with an acknowledgement of Spirit in whichever way that is meaningful to all. In other words express the movement from the mundane to the Sacred, the passing through the Machsom, the barrier, that sits between the two. Like the skin, that separates, and thus both blocks and protects, the inner parts of your body from the outer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And end each gathering with a blessing of gratitude to those Spirits that gathered to help and protect and guide the gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gather to talk of and plan actions in order to envisage, and collaborate in creating spaces and platforms that facilitate a more (w)holistic lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-with-the-food-and-water&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Start with the food &amp;amp; water &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#start-with-the-food-and-water&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the food and the water. Reams has been said and written on this topic. From the nutritional to the spiritual, not ignoring the emotional nor the mental aspects of our food and the manner in which we absorb the nutrition and the effect it has upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, in itself, will produce a change in everything. In order to obtain organic and free-range food, will require a change of lifestyle, it will feed those who have also embarked on a spiritual path. What we require from them is that they too will be part of the community or at least the web of communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not even begin to speak of the effort that it might take to ensure that we all have good water to drink. Because at this stage most water that we drink is no longer free. In fact we have sunk so low, that we drink it out of plastic bottles in which they have been confined. I would suggest that we drink more cress water, and less adulterated water in the form of soda’s, or caffeinated drinks, etc. Once that has been achieved, then the hunt is on to find pure water, water that itself has been less adulterated by human interference than most of our tap water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the concept of &lt;em&gt;Kosher&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Halaal&lt;/em&gt;, where we restrict ourselves to “spiritually” acceptable food, and never indulge in food that is not “kosher”, that is firstly, physically harmful, and secondly spiritually inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we focus on these aspect of our lives, these very practical and essential items, many things will begin to change right there. Even if you are practicing this, there is probably still some room for improvement – or for service. Helping others attain this; making it easier for each of us to obtain this food, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;collaboration-not-competition&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Collaboration, not competition &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/organisations/#collaboration-not-competition&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration, not only competition, needs to be a basic principle of each of the communities. With this, we can begin to build cohesion. At least being in agreement of what it means in relation to the food that we eat and that we produce to be “honouring the earth and the creatures of the earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though all of this might seem a far of dream and even idealistic too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me get more prosaic, and call on pure common sense, of which it seems many are just lacking. It is not about wars, and weapons and pollution, etc, but on carrying out actions and supposing a lifestyle that is destructive to both yourself and your environment. It is very likely that much of what is making us sick is also toxic to our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could ask the question why in the name of all that is holy would someone want to poison himself? Well there are a number of reasons, and even necessary reasons, though if deemed unnecessary, one would call it an addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realise we are not perfect and we make mistakes, but it is not the mistake that is the issue, it is the not rectifying it, or trying to improve that becomes the sin, what we would call dishonorable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if there are pesticides, which are poisons, in my food, why would I eat that, if all things being equal, I had a choice? Now, there might be a percentage that could find it appealing and continue with the poisoned food, but that would only be a small percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it makes sense to eat things that come from the earth, and are grown with the minimum of human inputs? Though this might vary from place to place, and thus different solutions might be appropriate for different circumstances, I still don&#39;t understand how economically it is cheaper to sell processed food rather than unprocessed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this economic system obviously incentives the processing of food, and not the growing and distribution of unprocessed foodstuffs. I believe we have the capacity to change this, and we can only do it together, through an organised network of collaboraters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/book_gift/bg002%20-%20The%20Beginning/#analysis-of-in-the-beginning&quot;&gt;Analysis of &amp;quot;in the beginning&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-beginning&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;In the Beginning &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/book_gift/bg002%20-%20The%20Beginning/#in-the-beginning&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, there was .... a becoming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darn! I&#39;m already confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s try from another point. Before the beginning... there was.... nothing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes no sense! Because how can there be a &amp;quot;before&amp;quot; when we are speak of existence itself. I mean, what existed before everything existed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, if you want to be really pedantic, you could claim that non-existence - a different kind of existence? - non-existed before existence. Does it now not exist anymore? Which brings in a very good question, the question of what does not exist because we of this existence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, to continue, it seems that, as far as we can cognite, our very existence &amp;quot;begins&amp;quot; at a certain point, just as we hypothesis for the &amp;quot;birth of the universe&amp;quot;, the Big Bang! Intrinsic in this view is a reflection of our own finite existence. We cannot really comprehend the concept of an endless universe - that is too grand for our finite minds. So, in order to speak of such things, we have to have a beginning &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/book_gift/bg002%20-%20The%20Beginning/time.html&quot;&gt;Time Bound&lt;/a&gt;, a &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; at which the story of our existence begins - which is referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/book_gift/bg002%20-%20The%20Beginning/beginning.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;In the beginning&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;bereishit&lt;/em&gt; בראשִׁת. &amp;quot;In the beginning arose a single point&amp;quot;, a singularity represented by &amp;quot;in&amp;quot;, the moment it all began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this point so important? Because it speaks of an &lt;strong&gt;imperfection&lt;/strong&gt;, or apparent &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/book_gift/bg002%20-%20The%20Beginning/perfect.html&quot;&gt;imperfection in the Perfection&lt;/a&gt; that existed before. Like the tiniest stain on an otherwise white cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let us speak of &amp;quot;before&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Long, long time ago, before time, and thus before before, in a place of absolutes - perfect silence, total peace, continuous perfection, absolute and complete ... nothing, no words, no actions, no sound - nothing could express this... no words, sounds thoughts or ideas (and that is why we call it &lt;em&gt;Nothing&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis-of-&amp;quot;in-the-beginning&amp;quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Analysis of &amp;quot;in the beginning&amp;quot; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/book_gift/bg002%20-%20The%20Beginning/#analysis-of-%22in-the-beginning%22&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the beginning
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This phrase represents &amp;quot;the beginning&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;start&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;first...&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different from &amp;quot;from the beginning&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In/from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speaks of a position, a point/place in time. &amp;quot;In the beginning&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represents a dynamic, circular motion, or angular momentum.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &amp;quot;beginning&amp;quot; represents a point in time, what does &amp;quot;in&amp;quot; represent in this case?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where the language begins to play a part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;bereishit&lt;/em&gt; means also &amp;quot;first&amp;quot;, so it could be translated as &amp;quot;first G-d created...&amp;quot;. Does that make it clearer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is also a feeling of &amp;quot;at the beginning&amp;quot;. In the reading it is like an unfolding that takes place. It might have taken place so fast (or so slow) that we cannot fully comprehend it, but we know something really inspiring and amazing and wierd happend &amp;quot;at that beginning&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From: speaks of a distance, a motion. &amp;quot;From the very beginning&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheep, without a shepherd, wandering in the wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;
You thought the ancient teachings were no longer relevant. That we were beyond slavery. We survived the holocaust. Six million had perished, and we had flourished. If we could survive that, we could survive anything. In addition, we bred our offspring to embrace the brave cry of &amp;quot;Never again!&amp;quot;. And in our pride, we abandoned the old ways, and embraced the new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science would save us. We could see into the furthest reaches of the universe, and imagine things unimaginable. We had opened the very womb of nature, and could mess with her offspring. We were like gods - of so we thought. Forgetting that this &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; that we live in was here long before any of us were even a thought, and will be around long after we have been forgotten for many aeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, my children, let us not acknowledge that their might - nay there has to be - a Creator of some nature. Somehow all this that we live and experience fell into place, and we are the conscious result of that. And you can convince yourself that it is an &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; of .... nature - a nature that is itself a product of this very creation that we are exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some images or comparisons [Sanskrit: &lt;em&gt;upamanas&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moksa&lt;/em&gt; or final emancipation from the earthly bondage forms the chief aim of every system of philosophy in ancient India. &lt;em&gt;Upamana&lt;/em&gt;, the comparison, is regarded as an independent means of valid knowledge. The final liberation can be attained through the correct knowledge of the objects. In Buddhism such &lt;em&gt;upamanas&lt;/em&gt;, comparisons, are profound &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; teachings leading to liberation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, look at these children who are piling up earth and building castles, ramparts, villages, houses. They say that it is rice or wheat flour; they like it, they are attached to it, they keep it and they protect it. But when the evening comes, they are no longer interested in them, they tread them underfoot, they break them, destroy them, disperse them and eliminate them. Foolish worldly people do the same: as long as they do not renounce desire, they have feelings of love and attachment for &lt;em&gt;dharmas&lt;/em&gt;; but as soon as they have renounced desire and see the &lt;em&gt;dharmas&lt;/em&gt;, they disperse them, destroy them and reject them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Commentary of the Greater Perfection of Wisdom”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Nagarjuna. 150 BC. India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translator: Kumarajiva. 402 B.C. China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Summary. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#summary.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sunyata&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;Emptiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not for a moment think Emptiness means that the objects are empty or illusionary, or that they are not real or existing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian philosopher Nagarjuna (2nd century Current Era) is known in the history of Buddhism mainly by his keyword ‘&lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;’. This word is translated into English by the word ‘emptiness’. The translation and the traditional interpretations create the impression that Nagarjuna declares the objects as empty or illusionary or not real or not existing. What is the assertion and concrete statement made by this interpretation? That nothing can be found, that there is nothing, that nothing exists? Was Nagarjuna denying the external world? Did he wish to refute that which evidently is? Did he want to call into question the world in which we live? Did he wish to deny the presence of things that somehow arise? My first point is the refutation of this traditional translation and interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dependence&lt;/strong&gt; or ‘relational view’.&lt;br /&gt;
Here I transcribe ‘&lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;’ by the word ‘dependence’. Now Nagarjuna’s central view can be named ‘dependence of things’. He is not looking for a material or immaterial object which can be declared as a fundamental reality of this world. His fundamental reality is not an object. It is a relation between objects. This is &lt;strong&gt;a relational view of reality&lt;/strong&gt;. Reality is without foundation. Or: Reality has the wide open space as foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is happening between these two &#39;things&#39;? This space, the gap, is not empty, nor filled with nothing. It is not the behaviour of bodies, but the behaviour of something between them may be essential for understanding the reality. This &#39;empty&#39; space is full of energy. This space is the &#39;middle&#39; between things. Things are going arm-in-arm. The middle might be considered as a force that bonds men to the world and it might be seen as a force of liberation. It might be seen as a bondage to the infinite space, or as participating in the existence of infinite space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagarjuna, we are told, was a Buddhist philosopher. This statement is not wrong when we take the notion ‘philosophy’ in a deep sense as a love to wisdom, not as wisdom itself. Philosophy is a way to wisdom. Where this way has an end, wisdom begins and philosophy is no more necessary. A.N. Whitehead gives philosophy the commission of descriptive generalization. We do not need necessarily a philosophical building of universal dimensions. Some steps of descriptive generalization might be enough in order to see and understand reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another criterion of Nagarjuna’s philosophy. Not his keywords ‘sunyata’ and ‘pratityasamutpada’ but his 25 philosophical examples are the heart of his philosophy. His examples are images. They do not speak to rational and conceptual understanding. They speak to our eyes. Images, metaphors, allegories or symbolic examples have a freshness which rational ideas do not possess. Buddhist dharma and philosophy is a philosophy of allegories. This kind of philosophy is not completely new and unknown to European philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European modes of thought had no idea of the space between two things. They were bound to the ideas of substance or subject, two main metaphysical traditions of European philosophical history, two main principles. These substances and these subjects are two immaterial bodies which were considered by traditional European metaphysics as lying, as a sort of core, inside the objects or underlying the empirical reality of our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first European scientist who saw the forces between two things had been Michael Faraday (1791-1867). Faraday was an English scientist who contributed to the fields of electromagnetism. Later physicists like Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg and others followed his view in modern physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fifth point of my work. I compare Nagarjuna with European scientific modes of thought for a better understanding of Asia. I do not compare Nagarjuna with European philosophers like Hegel, Heidegger, Wittgenstein. The principles and metaphysical foundations of physical sciences are more representative for European modes of thought than the ideas of Hegel, Heidegger and Wittgenstein and they are more precise. And slowly we are beginning to understand these principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take as an example the interpretation of quantum entanglement by the British mathematician Roger Penrose. Penrose discusses in the year of 2000 the experiences of quantum entanglement where light is separated over a distance of 100 kilometers and still remains connected in an unknown way. These are well known experiments in the last 30 years. Very strange for European modes of thought. The light should be either separated or connected. That is the expectation most European modes of thought tell us. Aristotle had been the first. He told us: Either a situation exists or not. There is not a third possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now listen to Roger Penrose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Quantum entanglement is a very strange type of thing. It is somewhere between objects being separate and being in communication with each other”&lt;br /&gt;
(Roger Penrose, &lt;em&gt;The Large, the Small and the Human Mind&lt;/em&gt;, Cambridge University Press. 2000, p. 66).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentence of Roger Penrose is a first step of a philosophical generalization in a Whiteheadian sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The metaphysical foundations of modern science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These foundations had been examined particularly by three European and American philosophers: E. A. Burtt, A.N. Whitehead and Hans-Georg Gadamer. I try to follow the approaches of these philosophers of anti-substantialism and relational thought. By ‘metaphysical foundations’ I do not understand transcendental ideas but simply the principles that are underlying sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;&lt;strong&gt;Complementarity&lt;/strong&gt;’, ‘&lt;strong&gt;interactions&lt;/strong&gt;’, ‘&lt;strong&gt;entanglements&lt;/strong&gt;’.&lt;br /&gt;
Since 1927 quantum physics has three key terms which give an indication to the fundamental physical reality: Complementarity, interactions and entanglement. These three notions are akin to Nagarjuna’s relational view of reality. They are akin and they are very precise, so that Buddhism might learn something from these descriptions and quantum physicists might learn from Nagarjuna’s examples and views of reality. They might learn to do a first step in a philosophical generalisation of quantum physical experiments. All of us we might learn how objects are entangled or going arm in arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nagarjuna&#39;s-view-of-reality.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Nagarjuna&#39;s view of reality. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#nagarjuna&#39;s-view-of-reality.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagarjuna was the founder of the Middle Way School, &lt;em&gt;Madhyamaka&lt;/em&gt;, which became fundamental to all Tibetan Buddhist traditions. It is a path of inner liberation which avoids the extreme views of own being or substantialism and subjectivism. In Nagarjuna&#39;s main work, &lt;em&gt;Mulamadhyamaka-karika&lt;/em&gt; (MMK), the Middle Way is described as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What arises dependently (&lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt;) is pronounced to be substancelessness (&lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;). This is nothing but a dependent concept (&lt;em&gt;prajnapti&lt;/em&gt;). Substancelessness (&lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;) constitutes the middle way”.&lt;br /&gt;
[Mulamadhyamaka-karika: chapter 24, verse 18]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagarjuna&#39;s view consists principally of two aspects. The first is an exposition of his view of reality (&lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt;), according to which reality has no firm core and does not consist of independent, substantial components. Reality is rather a system of two-bodies or many bodies which reciprocally affect each other[^3]. This view of reality is diametrically opposed to another key concept: ‘&lt;em&gt;svabhava&lt;/em&gt;’, ‘own being’ or ‘inherent existence’, also known in the Greek tradition as ‘substance’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of Nagarjuna’s philosophy is an answer to the inner contradictions of four extreme modes of thought which can be subsumed under the headings: ‘substantialism’, ‘subjectivism’, ‘holism’ and ‘instrumentalism’. My thesis is that these four modes of thought are unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;substantialism&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Substantialism &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#substantialism&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Substance (or own being) is defined as something that has independent existence&lt;/em&gt;.[^4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantialism is at the centre of traditional metaphysics. Substance is considered to exist by itself, i.e. the unchangeable, eternal and underlying basis for the entire non-material foundation of the world in which we live. Plato made a distinction between two forms of being: on the one hand, singular objects which exist&lt;br /&gt;
exclusively through participation without own being and, on the other hand, ideas that do have own being. Traditional metaphysics adopted Plato’s dualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An independent own being is characterised as something that, as an existing thing, is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not dependent on anything else (Descartes);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;existing by itself and subsisting through itself (More);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is completely unlimited by others and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;free from any kind of foreign command (Spinoza);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exists of itself without anything else (Schelling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest substance was often understood as God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Kant&#39;s ‘Copernican Revolution’ the primary question of philosophy has no longer been to comprehend reality, but rather to fathom the mind, i.e. the source of perception and knowledge. For this reason traditional metaphysics has lost ground in the modern world. In fact its central concepts, such as ‘substance’, ‘reality’, ‘essence’ and ‘being’ have been replaced by the reductionist modes of thought of modern science. Now ‘atoms’, ‘elementary particles’, ‘energy’, ‘fields of force’ and other concepts derived from the ‘laws of nature’ are viewed as the fundamental ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;subjectivism&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Subjectivism &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#subjectivism&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjectivism is the philosophical theory that all knowledge is subjective, and relative&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to René Descartes (1596-1650) consciousness is primarily existent and everything else is sheer content or form, a creation of consciousness. Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002) emphasises that subjectivity i.e. self-awareness has become the fulcrum of modern philosophical thought which provides us with evidential proof and certainty. This view has been continually brought into doubt by modern physical science. However, these doubts have not led to a new view of reality but to a fatal separation of philosophy and the sciences. This separation has exacerbated the dualism that preoccupies modern thought. Accordingly, the physicist P.C.W. Davies, expounds in his 1986 book that electrons, photons or atoms do not exist; they are nothing but models of thought.[^5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;holism&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Holism &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#holism&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holism is “the view that an organic or integrated whole has a reality independent of and greater than the sum of its parts”&lt;/em&gt;.[^6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third approach avoids the fatal either-or dichotomy of the first two approaches by merging subject and object into one entity, such that there are no longer any separate parts but only one identity: all is one. ‘Wholeness’ is made absolute, is mystified and becomes an independent unity that exists without dependence on its parts. Wholeness is understood as something concrete as if it was a matter of fact or an object of experience. As a philosophical approach found in great periods of European history of philosophy, this view is connected with names like Thomas Aquinas (1224-1274), Leibniz (1646-1716) and Schelling (1775-1854). In quantum physics, holism is represented by David Bohm. His key concept is &lt;em&gt;‘holomovement’, an undivided wholeness in flowing movement&lt;/em&gt;.[^7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;instrumentalism&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Instrumentalism &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#instrumentalism&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For instrumentalism, theories are not a description of the world but an instrument for a systematic classification and explanation of observations, and for the prediction of facts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of favouring subject or object or the two together, the fourth approach ignores the existence of the other three. According to this viewpoint the search for reality is insignificant and meaningless. Instrumentalism is quite modern, intelligent and sometimes hair-splitting and hypercritical. It is difficult to disengage from it. It is an extension of subjectivism and it regards the process of thinking as model making and as working with information, without concern as to what phenomena the information is about. What philosopher Donald Davidson (1917-2003) said about subjectivism, might be true for instrumentalism also: “Once one makes the decision for the Cartesian approach, it seems that one is unable to indicate what one’s proofs are evidence for”.[^8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instrumentalist approach is outlined by the experimental physicist Anton Zeilinger who stated in an interview, “In classical physics we speak of a world of things that exists somewhere outside and we describe their nature. In quantum physics we have learned that we have to be very careful about this. Ultimately physical sciences are not sciences of nature but sciences of statements about nature. Nature in itself is always a construction of mind. Niels Bohr once put it like this:[^9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘There is no world of quantum, there is only a quantum mechanical description’”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nagarjuna&#39;s-viewpoint.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Nagarjuna’s viewpoint. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#nagarjuna&#39;s-viewpoint.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagarjuna presents these four extreme views of reality in a scheme that is called in Sanskrit: ‘&lt;em&gt;catuskoti&lt;/em&gt;’, the equivalent of the Ancient Greek ‘&lt;em&gt;tetralemma&lt;/em&gt;’, a figure in Ancient Greek and Eastern logic with four possibilities, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Things have no substance:
  1. neither out of themselves,
  2. nor out of something else,
  3. nor out of both,
  4. nor without a cause.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of &lt;em&gt;tetralemma&lt;/em&gt; refutes the four modern views of reality as above mentioned:[^10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neither from itself nor from another, nor from both, nor without a cause, does anything whatever anywhere arise”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse can be understood as the principal statement of the MMK: the refutation of the four extreme metaphysical views which cannot be reconciled with the dependent arising of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another text, Nagarjuna gives some indications how to understand this view. He writes in his &lt;em&gt;Yuktisastika&lt;/em&gt; (YS): 19.[^11]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That which has arisen dependently on this and that that has not arisen substantially (&lt;em&gt;svabhavatah&lt;/em&gt;). What has not arisen substantially, how can it literally (&lt;em&gt;nama&lt;/em&gt;) be called &#39;arisen&#39;? […] That which originates due to a cause and does not abide without (certain) conditions but disappears when the conditions are absent, how can it be understood as &#39;to exist&#39;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the notions of ‘to arise’ and ‘to exist’, Nagarjuna does not mean the empirical existence but the substantial existence. When in many passages of MMK Nagarjuna states that things do not arise (MMK 7.29), that they do not exist (MMK 3.7, 5.8, 14.6), that they are not to be found (MMK 2.25, 9.11), that they are not (MMK 15.10), that they are unreal (MMK 13.1), then clearly this has the meaning: things do not arise substantially. They do not exist out of themselves; their independence cannot be found. They are dependent and in this sense they are substantially unreal.&lt;br /&gt;
Nagarjuna only rejects the idea of a substantial arising of things which bear an absolute and independent existence. He does not refute the empirical existence of things as explained in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&#39;It exists&#39; implies grasping after eternity. It does not exist implies the philosophy of annihilation. Therefore, a discerning person should not decide on either existence or non-existence”. (MMK 15.10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Nagarjuna, the expression ‘to exist’ has the meaning of ‘to exist substantially’. His issue is not the empirical existence of things but the conception of a permanent thing i.e. the idea of an own being, without dependence on something else. Nagarjuna refutes the concept of independent existence which is unchangeable, eternal and existing by itself. Things do not arise out of themselves, they do not exist absolutely and are dependent. Their permanent being or existence cannot be found. The many interpretations of Nagarjuna which claim that he is also refuting the empirical existence of objects, are making an inadmissible generalization which moves Nagarjuna near to subjectivism, nihilism and instrumentalism. Such interpretations originate in metaphysical approaches which themselves have a difficulty in recognizing the empirical existence of the data presented. This is not at all the case with Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna presents the dependence of phenomena mainly in images as in the twenty-five chapters of the MMK.[^12]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A projectile after penetrating an apple. The penetration of the&lt;br /&gt;
projectile is the cause of the direct effect: the beginning of an explosion of the apple. This happens at the same moment. Cause and effect cannot be separated. They are not one object and they are not two separated objects. There is no space and no time between cause and object. The cause leads immediately to a near effect. There is not first a cause and later an effect. The most important characteristic of bodies is their interdependence and the resultant, substanceless- ness, the impossibility of existing individually and independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is no action there is no agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither exists per se. Action and agent are not isolated components; they arise only by their dependence on other bodies. Not the behaviour of bodies but the behaviour of something between them is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The material or immaterial components of a two-body or three-body system do not exist in isolation, they are not one and yet they are not independent of each other. Something is happening between these bodies and because of this, they are not substantially real. Nagarjuna emphasises one central idea: bodies are neither together nor separated. The most important characteristic of bodies is their interdependence and the resultant, substancelessness, the impossibility of an independent and individual existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering is not independent from a cause of suffering and not identical with its cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be no cause without an effect, or an effect without a cause. The notion ‘cause’ has no meaning without the notion ‘effect’. Cause and effect are not one, but they cannot be separated into two independent notions either. Like suffering, reality does not consist of single, isolated material or immaterial components; suffering arises only by dependence on other causes. Like everything in this world suffering and its cause are not one and they are not two different objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no liberation without bondage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two complementary realities, bondage and liberation, the nature and the existence of each are dependent on the other. There is no fundamental core to reality; rather reality consists of systems of interacting facts or ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually two waters get mixed when they come together. These two impure waters remain separated in the same river at the beginning of the Amazon. Only after 30 km they are completely mixed. A fundamental or elementary or independent idea or notion does not exist. Our ideas or notions are dependent. One notion is contingent upon another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 25 out of 27 chapters, Nagarjuna emphasizes one central idea: bodies (&lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;) are neither together nor separated. The do not clump and stick together. The most important characteristic of bodies is their interdependence and the resultant, substancelessness, the impossibility of existing individually and independently. This is the meaning of &lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;: bodies (&lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;) are without own being and are not independent of each other. Reality does not consist of single, isolated material or immaterial components. It is not the behaviour of independent bodies but the behaviour of something between them that is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us concentrate on the 25 chapters: a thing is not independent of its conditions, nor is it identical with them. A mover does not exist without the distance within which to move. The mover and the distance are not one. They do not adhere to one another and they do not agglomerate to form larger bodies (&lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;). A viewer is not the same as the view, but a viewer without a view does not exist. There can be no cause without an effect, or an effect without a cause. The notion ‘cause’ has no meaning without the notion ‘effect’. Cause and effect are not one, but they cannot be separated into two independent notions either. Without a characteristic, we cannot speak of a character- ization, and the other way round. How could there be a desirous one without desire? When there is no action there is no agent, neither exists per se. Without fire there can be nothing designated as fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material or immaterial components of a two-body or three-body system do not exist in isolation. They are not one and yet they are not independent of each other. Something is happening between these bodies and because of this they are not substantially real. For two or sometimes three complementary bodies or for two concepts like cause and effect, or bondage and liberation, the nature and the existence of each are dependent on the other. The one arises with the other and disappears with the other. This is why a thing doesn’t arises substantially, neither out of itself, nor out of another, nor out of both, nor without a cause. There is no fundamental core to reality; rather reality consists of systems of interacting bodies. This view of reality is first and foremost an idea; a pointer to reality which cannot be described in words. One who can speak about concept-free reality has not experienced it. For the Buddhist tradition based on Nagarjuna, the yogic experience of substancelessness, the experience of dependent arising, the direct perception of reality as it is, all presuppose a high level of spiritual realisation which entails the abandonment of extreme views and the demolition of the entire edifice of dualistic thought and philosophy. To experience &lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt; means to become free of all entanglements of this world. &lt;em&gt;Nirvana&lt;/em&gt; is simply another expression for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Nagarjuna, the primary question was not about mind, nor about the origin of knowledge but about the reality of the physical world we are living in. Tarab Tulku Rinpoche presented an all encompassing position when he said:[^13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“everything existing partakes in a fundamental &#39;mind-field&#39;, which is the basic &#39;substance&#39; from which mind in a more individual way and the individual body develop”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to emphasise that Nagarjuna does not only speak about views without substance but also about bodies (&lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt;) without substance, here is a comparison with the views of reality suggested by quantum physicists. This is the reason for the title of this Essay: “&lt;em&gt;Eastern and Western Modes of Thought&lt;/em&gt;”. In order to understand Eastern modes of thought we should try to see our own modes of thought, our own traditional preconditions. In the modern Western world we have our own preconditions to see the modes of thought of Asia. We cannot deny this. We should not minimise the importance of our own modes of thought when we give an interpretation of Nagarjuna’s philosophy. I try to understand Nagarjuna’s philosophy from a view of ‘interaction’ and entanglement’ in modern physics or the behaviour of something between bodies (Albert Einstein). I try to understand modern physics from Nagarjuna’s view of ‘dependence of things’. Among these physical notions, there is not one that directly engages the principle of ‘&lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;’ or ‘&lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt;’. A notion such as ‘entanglement’ is not the same. It is akin to ‘&lt;em&gt;sunyata&lt;/em&gt;’ or ‘&lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt;’. It has similar qualities. There are many notions in the history of European philosophy which try to express that what bounds one object to one another. The philosopher A.N. Whitehead mentions more than 20 different notions to express his idea of the prehension (the act of seizing or grasping) or the connection or the relation of things. (Attachment, solidarity, relatedness, structural connection, cooperation, interaction, the networking of systems and many others.) We read in Whitehead’s &lt;em&gt;Adventures of Ideas&lt;/em&gt;, an explanation for the great variety of the terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;“Finally civilized language provides a whole group of words, each embodying the general idea under its own specialization. If we desire to reach the generality common to these various specializations, we must gather together the whole group of words with the hope of discerning their common element. This is a necessary procedure for the purpose of philosophical generalization. The premature use of one familiar word inevitably limits the required generalization by importing the familiar special connotation of that word”.

(A.N. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, Free Press, New York 1967, p. 236)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physics is about views and the conditions of physical reality. It creates models and thus examines only realities which have been posited by physics itself. Nevertheless, as the experimental psychologist Irvin Rock, who studied visual perception, describes it, we should not go so far as to consider all our perceptions and thought models to be purely adventitious. While the constructions of our mind are not identical with reality, they are not purely coincidental and usually not deceptive.[^14] Behind these models are empirical&lt;br /&gt;
bodies and there is some approximation of a structural similarity between a physical model and the corresponding physical and tangible reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a presentation or criticism of quantum physics but a discussion of the metaphysical views and principles which underlie quantum physics. The views of reality in quantum physics can be expressed by three key terms: ‘complementarity’, ‘four interactions’ and ‘entanglement’.[^15] In the prehistory of quantum physics it could not be proved experimentally whether the smallest elements of light were particles or waves. Many experiments argued in favour of one or the other assumption. Electrons and photons sometimes act like waves and sometimes like particles. This ‘behaviour’ was named: wave- particle dualism. The idea of dualism was therein understood to be a logical contradiction, in the sense that only one or the other could actually apply; but paradoxically both appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this understanding of traditional atomic theory, electrons and photons cannot be both particles and waves. According to atomic theory, a scientific explanation consists of a reduction of a variable factor into its permanent components and their applicable mathematical laws. This is the fundamental dualistic view that modern atomic theory has inherited from the natural philosophy of the ancient Greeks who expounded that substance and permanence cannot be found in objects of perception of the world in which we live, but can be found in the fundamental elements making up objects and their mathematical order. These material and immaterial foundations hold the world together, they do not change, although everything else changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the expectation of traditional atomic theory, it should be possible to reduce an object to its &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; elements, to its mathematical laws, or to its simple and fundamental principles. Until 1927 the fundamental elements had to be either particles or waves, they could not be both. What is to be understood by independent elements? As mentioned before, the notion of substance refers to something that has _independent__ existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;albert-einstein&#39;s-contribution-to-the-interpretation-of-quantum-physics.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Albert Einstein’s contribution to the interpretation of quantum physics. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#albert-einstein&#39;s-contribution-to-the-interpretation-of-quantum-physics.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein was following the aforementioned metaphysical tradition when he wrote in the year of 1948 very clearly:[^16]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;“For the classification of things that are introduced in physics, it is essential that these things have for a certain time an independent existence from each other, in so far as these things lie &#39;in different parts of space&#39;. Without the assumption of such an independent existence [Einstein uses the German term _So-sein_, this is akin to terms like substance, or being, or suchness] of things which, in terms of ordinary thought, are spatially distant from each other, physical thought in the usual sense would not be possible”.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of an independent reality was projected onto the basic element of the world of matter by atomic theory. For atomic theory, a scientific explanation means to reduce the variability and variety of objects and conditions to their permanent, stable, independent, and indivisible elements and to their conformity with mathematical laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the expectations of traditional atomic theory, all variations in nature can be explained in terms of separation, association and movements of unchanging, independent atoms or still more elementary particles. These particles and their conformity to mathematical laws constitute the core of bodies. They underlie everything and hold the world together. The question whether the fundamental objects are waves or particles was an explosive issue: at stake were the traditional metaphysical views of reality available to quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became evident that fundamental reality could not be grasped by traditional views of reality. What is the explanatory value of traditional atomic theory based on Democritus, if it becomes clear that there are no independent, stable atoms or elementary particles, and that objects have no stable core? Are these quantum objects objective, subjective, both or neither? What is reality? Is the quantum world completely distinct from the world in which we live?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1927, the physicist Niels Bohr introduced the idea of &lt;strong&gt;complementarity&lt;/strong&gt; into quantum physics. According to this idea, the wave form and the particle form are not two separate forms which contradict and exclude each other but are mutually complementary forms which can provide a complete description of physical manifestations only together. According to Niels Bohr, complementarity means that in the quantum world it is impossible to speak about independent quantum objects because they are in an interactive relationship with each other as well as with the instrument of measurement. He emphasized that this interaction between the quantum object and the instrument of measurement was an inseparable element of quantum objects, because it plays a major part in the development of several features of them. Certain measurements establish electrons or photons as particles and destroy the interference that distinguishes the object as a wave. Other measurements establish the object as a wave. This was Niels Bohr&#39;s new idea of reality. From the insight that the quantum object and the instrument of measurement could not be separated, Niels Bohr did not conclude that there are no quantum objects. At least he did not do so when he was arguing in terms of physics. When he spoke about the metaphysics of quantum physics he took an instrumentalist approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the physicist Niels Bohr, quantum physical objects consist of interacting and complementary quantum objects.[^17]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The double-slit experiment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/img/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics-52_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The double-slit experiment&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you send an atom of helium trough a double-slit, every atom produces a point behind the double-slit. The atoms arrive in discrete lumps. There is no interference in the beginning. The atoms arrive like bullets at the screen. But later they show interference. Their appearance shows the structure of waves in a similar manner to waves on water. The seven pictures shown were taken at intervals ranging from 5 minutes to 42 hours and 18 minutes. Quantum objects show a double quality of particles and of waves. They are dependent on the instrument of measurement: the double slit. This double quality has been named ‘complementarity’ by Niels Bohr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complementarity means that the two qualities are not dualistic. They do not exclude each other but complement each other like the poles of a dipole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feynman Diagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/img/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics-54_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Feynman diagram, an electron (left) and a positron (left) annihilate each other, producing a photon (represented by the blue sine wave) that becomes a quark/anti-quark pair (right). The photon represents the electromagnetic interaction or electromagnetic force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-concepts-of-interactions-in-the-standard-model-of-quantum-physics.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The concepts of interactions in the standard model of quantum physics. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#the-concepts-of-interactions-in-the-standard-model-of-quantum-physics.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of four elementary interactions was introduced in the standard model of quantum physics. These four forces obstruct the reduction of quantum objects into independent objects. Such an idea had already been posited by Democritus (460? - 370? BCE). These interactional forces which operate between the quantum objects, are added to the quantum objects. Instead of singular, independent objects, two-body systems or many-body systems were established as the base of matter. Between the bodies, interacting forces are effective in keeping them together.[^18]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These interactions are a composite of the bodies. Mostly they are forces of attraction and in the case of electro-magnetic forces they can also be forces of repulsion. One visualises the interaction between the elementary particles as an interaction of elementary particles. The physicist Steven Weinberg puts it like this:[^19]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;“At the present moment the closest we can come to a unified view of nature is a description in terms of elementary particles and their mutual interactions. [...] The most familiar are gravitation and electromagnetism, which, because of their long range, are experienced in the everyday world. Gravity holds our feet on the ground and the planets in their orbits. Electromagnetic interactions of electrons and atomic nuclei are responsible for all the familiar chemical and physical properties of ordinary solids, liquids and gases. Next, both in range and familiarity, are the &#39;strong&#39; interactions, which hold protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus. The strong forces are limited in range to about 10-13 centimetre and so are quite insignificant in ordinary life, or even in the scale (10-8 centimetre) of the atom. Least familiar are the &#39;weak&#39; interactions. They are of such short range (less than 10-15 centimetre) and are so weak that they do not seem to play a role in holding anything together”.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this respect, the explanations enter into quite difficult and subtle particulars. How, for example, can an electron which consists only of one particle be in interaction with another quantum object? What part of itself can it emit if it consists only of one particle? These questions can be answered by the concept of interaction. In fact an electron does not exist of only a single particle exactly because the interaction of the electron is a part of it. In 1978 The physicists Daniel Z. Freedman and Pieter van Nieuwenhuizen wrote in this regard that:[^20]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;“the observed electron mass is the sum of the &#39;bare mass&#39; and the &#39;self-energy&#39; resulting from the interaction of the electron with its own electromagnetic field. Only the sum of  the two terms is observable”.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What in quantum physics is known about interactions is here summarized in the words of the physicist and Nobel prize laureate Gerard &#39;t Hooft:[^21]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;“An electron is surrounded by a cloud of virtual particles, which it continually emits and absorbs. This cloud does not consist of photons only, but also of pairs of charged particles, for example electrons and their anti-particles, the positrons. […] Even a quark is surrounded by a cloud of gluons and pairs of quark and anti-quark”.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singular, isolated, independent quarks, a phenomenon which is called&lt;br /&gt;
‘confinement’ in recent research, have never been observed. Quarks are&lt;br /&gt;
captives, they cannot appear on their own but only as one of a pair or as one of a trio. When you try to separate two quarks by force, new quarks will appear between them which combine into pairs and trios. Claudio Rebbi and other physicists have reported that,[^22]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;“between the quarks and gluons inside an elementary particle, additional quarks and gluons are continuously formed and after a short time again subside”.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These clouds of virtual particles represent or produce interactions. The central core of quantum physics consists of a new view of reality that no longer perceives singular, independent elements but rather two-body systems, two states of a quantum object or two concepts, e.g., earth/moon, proton/electron, proton/neutron, quark/anti-quark, wave/measuring instrument, particle/measuring instrument, twin photons, super-positions, spin-up/spin-down, matter/anti-matter, elementary particle/field of force, law of nature/matter, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These systems cannot be separated into independent parts, or reduced to two separate, independent bodies or states, nor is one fundamental and the other derived, as the metaphysical either-or schemes of substantialism and subjectivism try to establish. They are not joined into a seamless unity either, they are not the same, they are not identical and they are not a mysterious wholeness as holism indicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we cannot claim, as instrumentalists do, that they are nothing but mathematical models which we have constructed and which do not correspond to physical reality. In physics, there is a fundamental reality that is not a one-body system. It is a two-body system or an assembly of bodies, a cloud of virtual particles which surround the&lt;br /&gt;
central or &#39;naked&#39; body. Between these bodies is an interaction that is one of the composites of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding of physics cannot be dislodged and yet all our metaphysical schemata struggle against it. The cloud does not conform to our traditional expectations of what should delineate and underpin stability, substantiality and order. How can clouds be what we are used to calling the basic elements of matter? How can this small vibrating something be what generations of philosophers and physicists have been searching for in order to arrive at the core of matter, the ultimate reality? Is this supposed to be it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these little clouds we attempt to use metaphysical interpretation to distil something that has substance and is enduring. Entirely within the sense of the substance metaphysics of Plato, Heisenberg (1901-1976) contends that the mathematical forms are the idea of elementary particles and that the object of elementary particles corresponds with this mathematical idea. The physicist and philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker (1912-2007) called mathematics &#39;the&lt;br /&gt;
essence of nature&#39;. According to the physicist Schopper, fields of force are the ultimate reality.[^23] Some of us want to see reality as a mysterious whole (holism) or dismiss it as a construction without any correspondence to empirical reality (instrumentalism). All of this only because we do not find it easy to admit that the complex interactions of the world in which we live have their roots in a reality that is in itself complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to escape from the entanglement of this world in quantum physics and, to find an elementary quantum object that is not dependent on other quantum objects or on parts of itself. It is also impossible to dissolve the double-sided character of quantum objects. The fundamental reality of our physical world consists of clouds of interacting quantum objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/neshama/Nagarjuna%20&amp;amp;%20Quantum%20Physics/#conclusion.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that reality is not static, solid or independent and does not consist of singular, isolated material or immaterial factors, but of systems of dependent bodies. Most systems consist of more than two bodies, but there is no system that consists of less than two bodies. In quantum physics we call such fundamental two-body systems: earth/moon, electron/positron, quark/anti-quark, particle/field, etcetera. Nagarjuna calls his systems or dependent pairs: mover/distance to move within, fire/fuel, agent/action, viewer/view, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both, quantum physicists and Nagarjuna deal with two-body systems or two entities which have bodies that are neither properly separate, nor properly joined together. They do not unite into one, nor do they fall apart. These bodies are not independent and cannot be observed singly because in their very existence and constitution they are dependent on each other and cannot exist or function independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are entangled by interactions, even at a far distance. One of them cannot be reduced to the other and it is not possible to explain one of them on the basis of the other. The resultant systems have a fragile stability, the components of which are maintained by interactions and mutual dependencies which are sometimes known, sometimes not fully known and sometimes totally unknown (for example as with entangled twin photons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is reality? We have become accustomed to believe in a firm ground under our feet and fleeting clouds above in the sky. The view of reality in Nagarjuna&#39;s thought and the ideas of complementarity, interactions and entanglement of quantum physics teach us that everything is built on sand. Moreover, even the grains of sand are not endowed with a solid nucleus. Their stability is based on balancing unstable interactions of their components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first place &lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt; is an indication of dependence. Dependent bodies are in an intermediate state - they are not properly separated and they are not one entity. Secondly, they rely on each other and are influenced or determined by something else. Thirdly, their behaviour is influenced by something in-between, for example a mover is attracted by gravitational force, a viewer is dependent on rays of light between his eyes and the object, a piano player’s action is determined by the fine motor skills of his fingers, an agent is dependent on his act. &lt;em&gt;Pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt; is an indication of dependence and of something that happens between the objects. One object is bound to the other without being identical to it. The implicit interpretations of pratityasamutpada, are in terms of time, structure and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following citations and references illustrate the term &lt;em&gt;pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Pratityasamutpada&lt;/em&gt; is used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as Dependence in Nagarjuna’s Hymn to the Buddha:[^24]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dialecticians maintain that suffering is created by itself, created by (someone) else, created by both (or) without a cause, but You have stated that it is dependently born”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as an intermediate state by Nagarjuna:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Objects are neither together nor separated” (Nagarjuna, MMK 6. 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as bondage in the &lt;em&gt;Hevajra Tantra&lt;/em&gt;:[^25]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Men are bound by the bondage of existence and are liberated by understanding the nature of existence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as an intermediate state by Roger Penrose:[^26]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Quantum entanglement is a very strange type of thing. It is somewhere between objects being separate and being in communication with each other”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as something between bodies by Albert Einstein: [^27]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A courageous scientific imagination was needed to realize fully that not the behaviour of bodies, but the behaviour of something between them, that is, the field, may be essential for ordering and understanding events”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as the mean between things in modern mathematics: to quote Gioberti again:[^28]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The mean between two or more things, their juncture, union, transit, passage, crossing, interval, distance, bond and contact – all these are mysterious, for they are rooted in the continuum, in the infinite. The interval that runs between one idea and another, one thing and another, is infinite, and can only be surpassed by the creative act. This is why the dynamic moment and dialectic concept of the mean are no less mysterious than those of the beginning and the end. The mean is a union of two diverse and opposite things in a unity. It is an essentially dialectic concept, and involves an apparent contradiction, namely, the identity of the one and the many, of the same and the diverse. This unity is simple and composite; it is unity and synthesis and harmony. It shares in two extremes without being one or the other. It is the continuum, and therefore the infinite. Now, the infinite identically uniting contraries, clarifies the nature of the interval. In motion, in time, in space, in concepts, the discrete is easy to grasp, because it is finite. The continuum and the interval are mysterious, because they are infinite”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two very short answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Clegg:[^29]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  “Entanglement is a strange feature of quantum physics, the science of the very small. It’s possible to link together two quantum particles — photons of light or atoms, for example — in a special way that makes them effectively two parts of the same entity. You can then separate them as far as you like, and a change in one is instantly reflected in the other. This odd, faster than light link, is a fundamental aspect of quantum science. Schrödinger, who came up with the name ‘entanglement’ called it ‘the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics’. Entanglement is fascinating in its own right, but what makes it really special are dramatic practical applications that have become apparent in the last few years”.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;``&lt;br /&gt;
According to Merali:[^30]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; “This weird quantum effect inextricably links two or more objects in such a way that measurements carried out on one immediately change the properties of its partners, no matter how far apart they are. Quantum effects, such as entanglement, are usually confined to the invisible microscopic world and are detected only indirectly using precision instruments”.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Newtonian physics is based upon the independent individuality of each bit of matter. Each stone is conceived as fully describable apart from any reference to any other portion of matter. It might be alone in the universe, the sole occupant of uniform space. But it would still be that stone which it is. Also the stone could be adequately described without any reference to past or future. It is to be conceived fully and adequately as wholly constituted within the present moment. This is the full Newtonian concept, which bit by bit was given away, or dissolved, by the advance of modern physics. It is the thorough-going doctrine of ‘simple location’ and of ‘external relations’. There was some divergence of opinion as to the external relations. Newton himself was inclined to construe them in terms of shock and stress between contiguous bodies. But his immediate followers, such as Roger Cotes, added the notion of force at a distance. But either alternative was wholly and completely a fact of that external relation between two bits of matter either contiguous or distant. (…) We have to discover a doctrine of nature which expresses the concrete relatedness of physical functionings, of the past with the present, and also expresses the concrete composition of physical realities which are individually diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern physics has abandoned the doctrine of Simple Location. The physical things which we term stars, planets, lumps of matter, molecules, electrons, protons, quanta of energy, are each to be conceived as modifications of conditions within space-time, extending throughout its whole range. There is a focal region, which in common speech is where the thing is. But its influence streams away from it with finite velocity throughout the utmost recess of space and time”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A.N. Whitehed, Adventures of Ideas, Free Press New York 1967, p.160,161)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein’s view is not different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Physics reality began with the invention of mass, force, and an inertial system. These concepts are all free inventions. They led to the formulation of the mechanical point of view. For the physicists of the early nineteenth century, the reality of our outer world consisted of particles with simple forces acting between them and depending only on the distance. He tried to retain as long as possible his belief that he would succeed in explaining all events in nature by these fundamental concepts of reality. The difficulties connected with the deflection of the magnetic needle, the difficulties connected with the structure of the ether, induced us to create a more subtle reality. The important invention of the electromagnetic field appears. A courageous scientific imagination was needed to realize fully that not the behaviour of bodies, but the behaviour of something between them, that is, the field, may be essential for ordering and understanding events” ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What impresses our senses as matter is really a great &lt;code&gt;concentration&lt;/code&gt; of energy into a comparatively small space”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  “I, on the other hand, am a positivist who believes that physical theories are just mathematical models we construct, and that it is meaningless to ask if they correspond to reality, just whether they predict observations”. Penrose, R. _The Large, the Small and the Human Mind_. In M. Longair (Ed.), _The Objections of an Unashamed Reductionist_, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 169: “It is not meaningless to ask about the correspondence between a model and object, because if a model is correct then it has structural similarities with the phenomena that it is reconstructing; otherwise it can lead to predictions for which there are no meaningful physical explanations, because they have no correspondence to experimental data.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most convenient context for investigating the forces of nature is a system of two objects bound together by mutual attraction. The earth and the moon, for example, constitute the most readily accessible system in which to observe the gravitational force. The hydrogen atom, consisting of an electron and a proton, has long been an essential testing ground for theories of the electromagnetic force. The deuterion, made up of a proton and a neutron, represents a model system for studies of the forces in the atomic nucleus. Now there is a bound system in which to investigate the force that acts between quarks, the constituents of protons, neutrons and many related particles. The system is called quarkonium, and it consists of a heavy quark bound to an equally massive antiquark. The force at work in quarkonium is the strongest one known; it has come to be called the colour force, and it is now thought to be the basis of all nuclear forces. Of the various two-body systems the simplest in some respects is the artificial atom called positronium”&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, a network is a graph with a set of nodes and a set of pairs of nodes called edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s the difference between graphs and networks? While a graph is an abstract mathematical object, a network is a real-world web with specific structural properties. These properties have been exploited to investigate the origin and evolution of networks and to study the processes taking place on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanisms---protocols-of-engagement&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Mechanisms – protocols of engagement &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#mechanisms---protocols-of-engagement&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of two communities, the basic entity that we refer to as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/sustainable.html&quot;&gt;sustainable community&lt;/a&gt; (SC). In most cases there is very little communication between these communities. I envisage a network of sharing that will enable them to be far more effective as well as a larger network that will enable them to be supported by a larger community upon which they can call upon in times of need and use as a market for their products and services. This is the part of the space which the network will serve – enabling more effectiveness, to be utilitarian and beneficial to all members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;internet&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Internet &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#internet&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;scale-free-network&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Scale free network &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#scale-free-network&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of routes linked by various physical lines. Ideally, the Internet would be a growing network with no central control authority. However, there are certain &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; nodes, often referred to as hubs, and these will have influence over, and access to, many of the nodes connected to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the creation of a new seed, the basic node, or affinity group, two factors will determine whom to connect to: distance and bandwidth. While distance puts obvious constraints, bandwidth, which is a measure of the connection between the two people in a group, will typically be the dominant factor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of Internet topology is crucial to investigate the robustness of the network under failures, which involve nodes randomly, and attacks, which purposely decimate network hubs. If the network is highly connected and dominated by few hubs, then random failures are generally not problematic, but a successful attack on a vital hub would have Draconian effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the channels of communication are directed and controlled, what is being communicated and who hears it is controlled for the main part by the participants of this communication - until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has to be one of the most important issues to address in the creation of a sovereign, private, community driven and facilitated network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-world-wide-web-(social)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The World Wide Web (Social) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#the-world-wide-web-(social)&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a connected web in which nodes represent Web pages and edges are the hyperlinks between pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of network is known as unweighted, as it is makes no intrinsic difference to the network how many connections any page is linked to, except for mapping purposes. But the web continues to function if there is one link between the page or hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most surveys of the web look at the connections between pages, or (see 2 below) the physical connections between the computers that make up the web (ie the internet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-networks-(social)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Social networks (Social) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#social-networks-(social)&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a dominant social force that arose, was the groupings that manifested the connections between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of social networks. Our family is one. Your social circle is another. Both provide good examples of interlinking networks, webs are they are commonly referred to. Or one could think of them as circles that intersect at a certain point. John, your best friend works at IBM. Jill, your girlfriend works for an NGO... etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social networks link people according to various &amp;quot;affinities&amp;quot;, like friendship, interests, work, desires, and more mundane activities, like shopping &amp;amp; entertainment. They are of extremely efficient mechanisms for the spread of information - both accurate and inaccurate - within groups, providing an accurate picture of the currents, both active and passive, in the ocean of human societies. They are wonderful tooos to better understand and anticipate the spread of ideas, innovatios, fads, as well as biological and computer viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the dominant position of hubs in sexual networks -- people with an extraordinary number of sexual partners -- has been adopted as an explanation of the partially unexpected diffusion and persistence of AIDS epidemic, which defies the predictions of classical epidemic models based on the homogeneous, random network hypothesis. Indeed, due to their high connectivity, hubs are easy to be infected and, once infected, they potentially can pass the virus to all linked people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, social networks has been extensively used to measure the social standing of people participating in the network. The interpersonal directed links in a social network are interpreted as input-output channels for the transmission of influence, and the possibly negative weight of links captures the endorsement strength between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These social networks are tracked, and can be easily exploited for various goals - mainly marketing - and through this social information, influencing the emergent social, political, media and information networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wether this exploitation is positive or negative is dependent on the intentions and goals of those wielding the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these networks are made by nature, other are built by humans. All of them are webs without a spider: there exist no central authority that regulates their growth, but evolve in a self-organized and decentralized way.&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/complexity.html#systems&quot;&gt;Complex Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the natural networks have existed for many years. Some of them (biological networks) have been here since millions of years. In the last years many researchers independently showed that real networks have similar topologies, regardless of their age, function, and scope, that elude the random world. Nature doesn&#39;t play dice, and neither should the human builders of networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would behoove the architects of these social networks and communication systems to take a lesson from nature&#39;s book, and ensure that these networks are also no central authority that sits at the center of the web controlling its growth. That is highly effective for specific (and often short term) goals - &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/in-finite_game.html&quot;&gt;the Finite Game&lt;/a&gt;. However, to play the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/in-finite_game.html&quot;&gt;Infinite Game&lt;/a&gt;, the network will need to be decentralised and self-regulating - which naturally emerges in &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/complex_systems.html&quot;&gt;complex systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;natural-webs&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Natural webs &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#natural-webs&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;food-webs-(nature).&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Food webs (Nature). &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#food-webs-(nature).&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are networks created by nature. In food webs, species are connected by links telling which species feeds on which other species. The links of these networks seldom go both ways, and hence food webs are also an example of directed networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying food webs is important to understand the ecosystem dynamics. For instance, ecologists believe that hubs of food webs are the keystone species of the ecosystem, paramount in maintaining the stability of the ecosystem. The ecosystem can easily survive if random species are deleted; if, however, hub species are removed, the ecosystem dramatically collapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;metabolic-and-protein-networks-(nature).&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Metabolic and protein networks (Nature). &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#metabolic-and-protein-networks-(nature).&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nodes of metabolic networks are simple molecules like water or ATP. The links are the biochemical reactions that take place between these molecules. Moreover, proteins can be viewed as nodes of a complex network in which two proteins are connected if they can physically interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cultural&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Cultural &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#cultural&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jews&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Jews &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#jews&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the Jews managed to succeed after arriving penniless in a new culture. The rooted themselves in their own communities by only using all the services that the community offered them – exclusively. They purchased all their food from the community – as it has to be kosher. The education was provided by the community as they wanted their children to get a good Jewish education. (See the notes accompanying discourse on TOL). They taught them to read and write, to do arithmetic and to think critically, producing excellent doctors, accountants and lawyers, thus empowering them to both deal with the societies they found themselves in, and to be able to access essential services from within the community. In addition, when someone catered to a non-Jewish client, or worked for a non-Jewish employer, most of their earnings were pumped back into the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This enabled them to enrich their own communities, as more money was coming into the community then was bleeding out of it – that is, supply exceeded demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This structure has a number of qualities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It had a moral imperative that you could activate within the community. Thus there was recourse to a Rabbi who would make a moral decision about conflicts, rather than relying on an external legal process. If there was a need for that, then there were generally lawyers within the community who could advise the participants as well as the Rabbi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It becomes a self-sustaining and self-supporting structure that has minimal reliance on the greater surrounding community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When services were provided to the greater community, that energy would be used to enrich the Jewish community itself. This provides an example of the way in which we can extricate ourselves from our reliance on the old, current paradigm. A form of the “build it and they will come”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;organic-food&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Organic food &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#organic-food&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple example would be to only eat food that is organic, thus supporting the organic farmers.&lt;br /&gt;
If everyone in the network only ate organic food, then a web of organic food producers and suppliers and consumers would naturally emerge in the network. As the energy circulated amongst this group so it would reverberate along larger and larger segments in the network. Once a certain momentum is reached, it would become a major player in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the more advanced version, it would behove the network to have its own legal, educational, and other practitioners. Thus becoming enriched and thus more able to become itself self-sustaining and harmonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;politicaleconomic&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Political/Economic &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#politicaleconomic&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;instance-7.-economic-networks.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Instance 7.

&lt;p&gt;Markets can be viewed as a huge directed multi-relational network. Companies, firms, financial institutions, governments play the role of nodes. Links symbolize different interactions between them, for instance purchases and sales or financial loaning, and the weight of the links captures the value of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;model-of-the-sovereign-entity.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Model of the Sovereign entity. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#model-of-the-sovereign-entity.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See notes accompanying discourse on TOL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporation is becoming a model of a sovereign entity. Though it is become “para-governmental” and is not guided by any other imperative than to survive and increase itself. It is a bit animal like, eat and reproduce – though as we all know that its food is not organic, but economic – lacking the “higher” skills of judgement, morality, social consciousness, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is one of the main reasons that we are speaking about it in terms of a nation, a nation being an entity that has a government, as a managing body, that is answerable to the members of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we declared this network a Sovereign entity with citizens, laws, codes of behaviour, etc? Just as the Jewish culture has created a culture that is in essence a sovereign nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose the concept of a nation, because our web has aspects of a nation, and that is why I sometimes speak of it as a community too. There are ways of “joining”, i.e. becoming a “citizen” of this nation; modes of behaviour required as well as ethical and moral imperatives’ embedded in the social fabric.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;example:-un-decade-of-the-child.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Example: UN decade of the child. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#example:-un-decade-of-the-child.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to enable the voice of the children to be heard, the UN allowed a representative with full nation status to sit on the UN to speak for the rights of the children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sanctions-and-boycotts&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sanctions &amp;amp; Boycotts &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#sanctions-and-boycotts&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctions are an agreement of the global community not to supply or interact with a country for moral reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boycotts are a willingness to do without certain things supplied by a group or company to which you have an objection, which is generally moral or ethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Sanctions generally do not affect the country (countries) imposing the sanctions. And most times if there is something that one of the sanctioning countries, they will break the sanctions overtly or covertly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Boycotts are better, because they are more personal. Through boycotts, once the critical mass is reached, we will be able to effect much change very quickly. As the call to arms has stated, “We vote with our dollars”. Meaning by the purchasing choices we make, we can affect the suppliers who are driven purely by the profit motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;example:-sa-breweries&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Example: SA Breweries &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#example:-sa-breweries&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this was SA during Apartheid when sanctions were imposed on it, became more self-reliant because it could not rely on the global community to supply all its needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A side effect was also that a lot of the local companies emerged from Apartheid cash-rich, and became global in their reach by buying up a lot of other companies when sanctions were lifted. An example of this was SA Breweries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;example:-bowling-for-columbine:&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Example: Bowling for Columbine: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#example:-bowling-for-columbine:&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Moore got K-Mart to agree to stop selling bullets for the automatic weapons that had been used in the Columbine massacre. North American Rifle Association boycotted K-Mart and it went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;usage:-coca-cola-principle&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Usage: Coca cola principle &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#usage:-coca-cola-principle&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to boycotts, in a business environment, which runs according to the equations of profit, if you could mobilise a critical mass of people to declare sanctions, it would have an immediate effect on profit. The CEO would notice the rapid loss of sales and negotiate to “Make what they want, or they won’t buy”. In a sense it is speaking the language of the driving force of our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;instance-4.-language-networks.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Instance 4. Language networks. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#instance-4.-language-networks.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these networks the nodes are words and the links represent relationships among words like significant co-occurrence in texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;instance-5.-citation-networks.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Instance 5. Citation networks. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#instance-5.-citation-networks.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article citation network links scholarly papers through bibliographic references contained in the bibliography of the papers. This network is directed and follows the temporal ordering of papers: we cite the past, not the future. Hence, cycles are very rare, and a citation network closely resembles a directed acyclic graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, papers may be aggregated at different levels, forming bibliometric units like scholars and journals. These bibliometric units can play the role of nodes is a citation network, with edges representing the citations among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, such a network is weighted, with the weight of an edge representing the number of citations between the journals participating in the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citation networks are fundamental tools in bibliometrics, the discipline that concerns itself with the study of the dissemination of knowledge through academic publication. In particular, bibliometric indicators like the PageRank-inspired Eigenfactor take full advantage of the topology of journal citation networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citation networks arise also in different contexts like patents and corresponding citations and published opinions of judges and their citations within and across opinion circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;instance-9.-powerline-and-airline-networks.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Instance 9. Powerline and airline networks. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/network_examples/#instance-9.-powerline-and-airline-networks.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are human-made networks. Failures may have cascading effects: the failure of one node may recursively provoke the failure of connected nodes. The topology of the network directly influences the magnitude and reach of such events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/4d-designs/#3d-designs-for-4d-systems&quot;&gt;3d designs for 4d systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/4d-designs/#shamans--mystics--mekubalim&quot;&gt;Shamans &amp;amp; Mystics (&amp;amp; Mekubalim)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3d-designs-for-4d-systems&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;3d designs for 4d systems &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/4d-designs/#3d-designs-for-4d-systems&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using 3d designs to build 4d structures, we are only perpetuating the 4d paradigm we are presently struggling with. We have to being to perceive our existence and what is happening and why from a 4d perspective, using the 3d structures, but not being constrained by its strictures.&lt;br /&gt;
One could the 4d as movement in 3d. In fact, it is through this very movement/change of 3d objects, that have enabled us to discover and describe the 4d version of said 3d object. Only through some movement, some change of state in 3d, that we could not describe using our 3d mathematical tools, could we even become aware of the possibility of the existence of such a 4d entity, leading us to more accurate (4d) descriptions (of the 3d empirical experience of matter). We describe the 4d objects as a composite of what we know, 3d objects – just as 2d may form a composite of 3d forms.&lt;br /&gt;
And just as 2d is highly effective in a 3d environment, it is limited and be predicted and controlled from a 3d perspective... so it is regarding one who has a 4d perspective on our 3d existence.&lt;br /&gt;
Up till now, we have presented this 4d landscape in religious, mythological and sociological terms, emphasising the qualities of love, kindness, humility, gentleness, etc. Though it includes pride, greed, lust, desire, etc. too. One could describe this as the 4d aspect of human beings, an unpredictable indescribable experience that that can have huge effect on our lives. Even among the aspects of 4d that we do know or recognise, they all “suffer” from unpredicable, yet known, behaviour. That is, although we know how it behaves, we cannot say what it will do at any moment with any certainty, until it has already done it (made its choice – so as to say).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have managed to overcome much of what has threatened us in the past. I believe many of the ills that we suffer from now, at this point of human evolution, are caused by humans... us. // We are our own worst enemy. We say that on an individual basis, and, it seems, as regarding the present crises we are facing. \ We are supposed to be an intelligent species – and we are. But if this is the best we can do, then it seems that some beastly, self-destructive urge is what has driven us to this evolutionary point.&lt;br /&gt;
My message it for us to enter the timeless zone of 4d prepared, because judging from what is unfolding, we are passing through into this amazing place, full of incredible surprises and amazing gifts. But let us not charge blindly into the space that angels fear to tread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shamans-and-mystics-(and-mekubalim)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Shamans &amp;amp; Mystics (&amp;amp; Mekubalim) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/4d-designs/#shamans-and-mystics-(and-mekubalim)&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamans and mystics, those intrepid explorers of the other realms, have indeed encountered this space in the earliest of days. How they did, we do not know. But there are many records of such journeys and dealings with this realm from all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;
In a time when the only language one could use to describe these realms was story and myth, we used archetypes and symbols that would awaken the unconscious mind, from mandalas to myth. However, we do have another language today to describe that space, although it is like the prince that will not take his place on the throne, denying all connection to his family – and that is the language of mathematics.&lt;br /&gt;
Science suffers from all the ills of any living religion. From the fanatics to the liberals, and all the various levels of interpretations of its texts, often by those who do not understand the original language it was written in.&lt;br /&gt;
So let us enter into the magical realm of 4d and work together to live in a future that is not decreed and driven by this 3d chaos, but embraces where life is leading us, and gather to ensure a future for being human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/fantasy_world/#the-fantasy-world&quot;&gt;The fantasy world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/fantasy_world/#fantasy-land&quot;&gt;Fantasy land&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;virtual-reality&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Virtual Reality &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/fantasy_world/#virtual-reality&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fantasy-world&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The fantasy world &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/fantasy_world/#the-fantasy-world&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fantasy world is a world of endless fascination, a world in which you could potentially fill all your desires. In that virtual reality you can project any persona you like, be multiple personalities, engaged in all sorts of social interactions – virtual for the most part, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;earthers-and-utopia&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Earthers &amp;amp; Utopia &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/fantasy_world/#earthers-and-utopia&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Earthers might decry this situation, where most of the world spends the majority of their time plugged into another reality (or realities), whatever tasks they are doing in the world of matter. These Earthers might sing the praises of a earthly lifestyle, where one grows ones own food, and eats the food that comes straight off the land, fresh and organic – while the rest of the world eat processed foods, synthesised and manufactured in human laboratories, as effective as that might ultimately be. Some even say it might be healthier – cleaner, more trustworthy as to the nutrient values, not subject to the vicissitudes of a fickle G-d. That we need to exercise regularly and breathe fresh air, swim in the ocean waters, walk amongst real trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you could be sitting in your comfortable chair and in your mind, be walking amongst the trees. You can smell the fresh pines and oaks, hear the birds chirping. Then stop off to take a swim in the river – knowing it was clean and safe. And you can experience all of this from that special chair in your living room, or lying on your comfortable, personally adapted, mattress – next to your loved one(s). Or you could decide to visit Paris and walk in the Louvre, with no one else around you could spend your afternoon gazing at the Mona Lisa – no crowds, no noise, just you and her. And if you wanted to, you could at the same time get close-ups of the painting, hear its history, or discuss painting techniques with the artist or others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that not the utopia we have always dreamed of? And now that we are on the precipice of this dream, we are baulking and saying that the price is too steep. But hear me, Earthers, you cannot stop the river of life from flowing along its path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utopians have dreamed of a world without hunger and poverty. A world in which people live together in harmony, and work out disagreements and problems in a non-violent manner. Where everyone has access to the basic resources they need to live a decent life. Education is free and available to all. All the books and information (except for certain particularly harmful items) is available, subject to requester’s qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;present-future&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Present future &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/fantasy_world/#present-future&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But have we ever thought about what that would look like with seven billion, 7,000,000,000 people on the planet – and growing every year exponentially? How much energy it would take to power that many people? What enormous amounts of food and water it would take to feed them? Or the amount of construction it takes to house them, especially if the majority have two places of abode – work and home. And let us not even touch on the amount of waste that is produced in the support and maintenance of this huge population of people. Include in this services, utilities, etc, etc... and we have a huge complicated mixture global and local systems of governance, trade, information, banking, etc. vying and competing to survive, cooperating for the most part, reluctantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact the figures very quickly become mind boggling. If the average use of water is one litre per day, we use seven billion litres of water a day. There is not a dam in the world that can hold anything close to that. [more specific info?]. And we know that the average is probably larger than that, even if its distribution is extremely skewed, and that the excess usage in many countries is, thank God, balanced by the under usage, one could say starvation, of the less fortunate majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if the future looks kind of dystopian? As long as we are not warring and killing and hurting and lying to one another as we are doing now. As long as people are no longer pretending to be someone else, and seek to express their authenticity, even if it is in the virtual world. Isn’t that what is most important? For the evil is not in the technology but in the hearts and minds of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, would it not be wonderful for a child to explore those fantasies and dreams that he has in a facilitated virtual reality environment? He could experience things that he would never have been able to experience, and might never experience again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;addiction-and-aps&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Addiction &amp;amp; APS &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/fantasy_world/#addiction-and-aps&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is the danger of addiction, of anti-social behaviour, etc. etc. etc. But perhaps there will be enough to occupy the potential addict, perhaps we will have been thoughtful enough to place safeguards. Or perhaps that person’s soul journey is one of addiction. Perhaps the AI/cybercontract1 mechanism would be able to monitor such occurrences, and then there must be human/AI interaction with the affected youngster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with APS – all pervading surveillance, how could one hide an addiction, especially of the sort that requires a connection to this virtual realm? What possibilities for crime here – just like smuggling people across countries when the world was caught up in national fever. And how to determine between an addiction and a healthy focus with concentration upon a certain topic or project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could design it, build it, develop it, test it – and even run projections and collect information on its effect on other parts of the system. Then we could transition the project into the real world slowly, with checks and balances in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Addiction: those who become addicted. Don’t want to leave. Perhaps there is a place for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;earn-time-in-cyberworld.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Earn time in Cyberworld. &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/fantasy_world/#earn-time-in-cyberworld.&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where all you basic necessities are taken care of, then what would one work for? But could this not result in the same situation? If you have lots of credits, you can afford to spend a huge amount of time in cyberspace. But if you are earning credits, why would you waste your time in fantasy land?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus there is the problem of a huge population that will have nothing to do, and nothing to incentivise them, that could turn very restive. There was only one solution – provide a living, and let them play in fantasy land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could there be a way of earning credits in fantasy spaces? Of course there are. [Later – discussion of earning possibilities]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fantasy-land&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Fantasy land &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/fantasy_world/#fantasy-land&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fantasy land you can create any life you want. You can spend the evenings with your family and children, and then during the day, enter the fantasy land, where you can live any life you desire. You could be an engineer, building in outer-space, or an explorer of unknown realms. You could be an emperor in a far away land, with a harem and spend your days in erotic bliss... but that then become an addiction, and nothing will come of that. We cannot live in that empty limbo for long without causing ourselves inner damage. Thus it will need to be incentivised – for instance, an emperor might have to defend his empire. Just like the hackers of today, would there not be those who might steal or even peddle your erotic fantasy, one that you might have spent years building up and perfecting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is similar to what is happening in the global financial system today. Where money has become more important than the actual item it represents. And where huge amounts of money are made and traded in the realm of money – an artificial, one could say, virtual realm. The realm of derivatives, loans, interest, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone would be able to express his or her deepest dreams and fantasies, while all the rest was being taken care of by an AI/MI/cybercontract society. The price would be that it would know everything about you – what you did, every conversation, and now, every desire. However, there would be no incentive, as there is today, to exploit this information to get money out of you – this would and might only take place in the virtual world – and only those that allowed that. Invitations to participate in new worlds, projects, ideas and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be closer to utopia than we have ever become. We may have found a wonderful solution to what ails us.&lt;br /&gt;
How real, and how fantastic, do you want your fantasy to be. You could participate in things with real avatars – avatars that represent real people, even though they might have taken on another persona. A man might offer himself up as a women, and then have sex with many “men”, whose avatars have remained bound to the same sex. One could even be having sex with alien “beings” - who are avatars of real people. As opposed to fantasy avatars that you (or your group) might have created from your imagination, and your narrative unfolds between you and these avatars. A type of 4th generation solitaire. Or playing chess with yourself – except that you can interface with a AI or intelligent andriods to create surprises and interesting twists. Of course you can decide what level of control you will have over the project. Finally, we have the hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#messiah&quot;&gt;Messiah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#enlightenment&quot;&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#circle-of-human-possibilities&quot;&gt;Circle of human possibilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#human-elements-he&quot;&gt;Human Elements (HE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;messiah&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Messiah &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#messiah&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how many of our great messianic prophets attained their state of prophecy. Jesus was born the messiah, the son of God. There was no special training he went through – though there has been much speculation on the matter. How did Mohammed, the Holy Prophet, become enlightened? He was a goat herder, an epileptic who had visions. No one taught him, he had not been an ardent practitioner of any training or tradition, though some may lay claim to that.&lt;br /&gt;
Buddha was born a prince, and stepping out of luxury into poverty, after encountering the real struggles of life, he went on a long journey of exploration – essentially rejecting all the mundane aspects of life. He may have studied and practised many paths to enlightenment, but it was essentially the impact of life that sent him on his quest.&lt;br /&gt;
Moses was not brought up Jewish – in fact, he pre-dates the Torah, upon which Judaism is based. His life was quite traumatic, but there was no revolutionary spirit, or visionary meditating and praying in the desert. In fact, he was herding sheep when God spoke to him. There are other examples, but the smaller ones are mostly offshoots variations on the major religion movements. (Zoroastrianism, Essene, Mormon, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here being that these Messianic spirits arose independently of the tradition which most of them would have been born into and practised. They often challenged the established faith, and introduced different forms of worship – that the established oligarchy often objected to. In fact, their inspiration, their “revelation” often comes from somewhere disconnected from the religion – some would say, simply, and solely, from G-d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if often the case, true change comes mostly from the periphery. How can someone steeped in the established traditions, who believes fully in them and assiduously practises them, actually find an expression that could be different from what he knows? Similarly, could this could then only come from God as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present there is need to expand our religious repertoire, and enter into dialogue with the current religious paradigm – called science. Although it may have many faults, it also has many good points, and religion should focus on that rather than be in constant conflict with emperical truths - called laws - that have been discovered. Science has affected the way we live in many meaningful ways in the last centuries, perhaps more so than religion has - and that needs to be attended to by extending our religious discourse to include such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, there are many Jews who see that Kosher, which was interpreted according to different circumstances, is not taking into account the way in which living beings are being treated to provide us with our Kosher meat. It emerged in a time when there was no factory farming, with aweful conditions that require pharmaceuticals, supplements, pesticides, and hormones for the animal or plant to survive. Now there exist such things, spawns of this science – and it affects our food. So I ask, can the cow that has been fed all these supplements be healthy - even though all its organs look intact?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to take face the reality of what is happening in the world today, and seek ways to navigate that – if not for our sakes, then for our childrens’ sakes. We are not talking about fads and fashions, trends or movements. We are talking about the changes in the very fabric of our society and its methods of production and extraction, manufacture and materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to hold the tide back, why are the religions, guided by G-d, helping us to apply ourselves to finding truly “kosher” solutions to our lives in the midst of these changes – which have just begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step boldly and bravely into the gap. That is the reason that there is an over-abundance of rabbis. So that they may find solutions from our texts and our explorations to these issues. We need priestly/spiritual think tanks, synods to decide how to navigate the coming assault on everything that it means to be human and a man of Godly faith – against those who believe that human made is superior to divinely fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enlightenment&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Enlightenment &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#enlightenment&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many seekers have “reached enlightenment”? How can the unenlightened know or discern that this person is truly enlightened? Especially since, except for Moses – who wrote the five books of the Torah, but nothing of the rest of the opus of Jewish laws and litany – all their words were transcribed from their teachings. In the case of Jesus, it was after his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;circle-of-human-possibilities&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Circle of human possibilities &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#circle-of-human-possibilities&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of us have the skill or talent. Just like not all of us are good at mathematics, even though we may all go through the same basic math training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one thought of a circle as representing all the of the possibilities of human. It would contain all the characteristics that have ever manifested themselves as well as any that possibly could.&lt;br /&gt;
We are each of us carved from this stone. Call it the root soul, if you like – &lt;em&gt;Adam Kadmon&lt;/em&gt;. We are gifted with a certain selection from this pool of characteristics. Because we can change, we can always embrace through training, intent, purpose, focus, one of these characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, to embrace one of your gifts and use that time and energy and commitment to further that one, would probably be far more beneficial to all and sundry. Though, because it is a natural law, there are always exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-elements-(he)&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Human Elements (HE) &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/messiah/#human-elements-(he)&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t master your own inner virtual space, how will you negotiate, develop, design, tech. spaces with their human elements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human element(s) considers the full range of human characteristics, including the good and the bad. The circle of probability within the circle of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any &lt;strong&gt;governing system&lt;/strong&gt;, whether economic or not, needs to be designed to take this into account. An economic system based on a extremely flawed and limited appreciation on what it takes to be human, relating to only a small subset of human needs and aspirations, is clearly inadequite. One could say that any system affecting us is only as good as the description of the elements of the system. Just as QP is trying to describe the very elements that make up our environment, so we need to find another language, more appropriate symbols, to describe the human elements that make up all our systems, and for whom all our systems are (and if not, need to be) built.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Sand Mandala</title>

		<id>https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/sand_mandala/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;sand-mandala&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sand Mandala &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/sand_mandala/#sand-mandala&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a sand mandala, every day I build a day of action and being, like a mandala of sand. Each night, when I sleep it is erased, and the next day, I begin to build anew.&lt;br /&gt;
“But things remain after I go to sleep that are still there the next day. Like the house I live in, my family, friends, my work, etc.”&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, those are the symbols that reappear in many mandalas, though they might reappear in different places, similarly, your house might be in a different place in your life to mine. These symbols are representations of things that exist, but perhaps in another realm, or from another realm, but do reappear in our lives time and again. Just as these mandalas with their symbols tell a story, you, with your house and family, have a history.&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine the mandala of your emotions then. Each day you awaken, you will produce a different mandala of emotions – even though those emotions might only come from a limited set of “symbols” – which we could term feelings or colours, as we often use colours to represent certain emotions. It is like looking at sad music as a symbol of sadness.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, what about your thoughts? Each day are you thinking the same thoughts? Then, I’m afraid, you might be caught in a loop, a kind of ground hog day – even if they are lovely. This kaleidescope of flashing thoughts, many of which flit by before you can even register them, changes from day to day too – even from moment to moment. And our mental realm is full of its archetypes too.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Money</title>
		<link href="https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/money/"/>

		<id>https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/money/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-money&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Future Money &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/money/#future-money&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money could be thought of as virtual token by which complex multi-layered transactions can take place over long-distances and long times. It should not be just a store of value. The value should be intrinsic to the article itself – and its actual cost to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is possibly one of the core factors that are causing the economic system to malfunction – and that is that fact that the monetary value has little to do with its intrinsic value. Instead it expresses it value through a system that is severely flawed. In a large part due to the biases and controls that keep money flowing along specifically designed channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking into account the fact that a system can only produce a result that is as good as or less than the source that it is taken from. Thus if you have a flawed source, you will have a system at least as flawed. Perhaps the place to start in proposing economic systems is to base them upon a more complete description of the basic units of the system – us! It takes seven variable to completely (mathematically) describe a Turing computer (which is the “type” of computers we have). Surely we humans are more complex – but nevertheless this could be a fruitful area of exploration, using the same methods and thought process that caused the academics to agree to this description, to attempt to describe human behaviour. With an more accurate starting equation, it might be possible to design a system that express and supports human behaviour more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new paradigm’s lack of rootedness requires a system of communication and organisation which will enable it to embed itself in the current reality, in order to implement the necessary dynamics for a better future to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sage: &amp;quot;Only purpose (evolution) is to evolve into a better version of your previous self&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear much talk of the coming paradigm shift, and am a believer myself in the necessity of such a shift. I have heard many versions of what this shift will look like, what it will be, where it comes from and perhaps even to what it is to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/paradigm_shift.html&quot;&gt;Piece on “new paradigm” vs. “current paradigm”.&lt;/a&gt; Includes &amp;quot;process philosophy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;agenda-of-change&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Agenda of Change &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#agenda-of-change&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How: Strategy: How are we going to bring about this transition?&lt;br /&gt;
Consciousness shift. From static, absolute, empirical view of objects that are time-invariant, to looking at events that are constantly becoming. That is, trying to find a local balance, or dynamic harmony within the greater system, and the local system. From a view of the universe that is static and absolutist, to one that is fluid, dynamic and relative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How: Implementation: What are the steps necessary to implement to shift from this paradigm to that “new” paradigm?&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of creating, perhaps we need to learn as a society, a nation and a community to practice constraint.&lt;br /&gt;
In any relationship of sharing there is a giver and a taker. One could say a loser and a winner. That is how energy flows. If the recipient uses all the energy to produce or maintain something productive, all and good. Waste is energy that is not utilised. If he hoards the energy, then it is not being used, and becomes toxic - for he will be collecting &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; energy. If he (the recipient) has used his energy well, he will have regained his strength, and will be able now to become a giver... That is how the circles are completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: Design: What structures that will support that?&lt;br /&gt;
Any structures that are built primarily around Truth.&lt;br /&gt;
That are supported by co-operation. That the planning is done by those who are the best people for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why: Motivation: How will we embed our vision of a new world in the current reality that we live in?&lt;br /&gt;
If it is the expression of the Oneness of everything, and everything that we are able to perceive and communicate with is respectfully dealt with - we will find the road to bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why: Vision: How do we root this idea in the world?&lt;br /&gt;
Prayer, meditation, clear thinking, knowing that Truth is our sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You may ask me often, what is this Truth that you speak of? You talk of it as if it is some sort of absolute. We all know that truth is relative, especially in a fluid universe. Tell us of this Truth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Truth that I speak of is also not static, yet it holds a position, and is measured by its distance from what is &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; happening - something we can never be truly aware of. This is because we firstly only see a small segment of the totality of any event, and secondly, because we can only perceive &amp;amp; comprehend an event after it has occurred and if we have the appropriate means of measuring the change so as to be able to register said event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expresses itself too subsequent to the event itself. For there is the event itself, which cannot be discussed in relation to its truth or falsity, for it is simply the event. That is the &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; of the occurrence. It is only subsequent to that, in the imaginarium of our minds, that we begin to cohere what had just occurred. As time passes, that memory, also fluid, is influenced by some of the factors that arise subsequently. Yet as it morphs, to the narrator it is still the sworn truth - as far as he or she is concerned, and there is little that will dissuade said person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if we measure outcomes, the truth will always triumph in the end. Although slow, each one of her steps are true! Whereas lies flit around like a butterfly on cocaine, always seek peace, but never finding a place to rest, for it has to constantly feed and maintain the lie(s), and if it ceases for one moment, all the lies will come tumbling down like a house of cards. It has no source of its own, except the truth, that is its nemisis, and it will use her to its advantage if it can. Thus, of utmost importance, is to be able to discern between truth and lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can one do that if one very parents lie. If one&#39;s teachers and leaders lie. Where is truth hiding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brother, and sister, friend and foe, know that truth is never hidden. As we say, she hides in plain sight. For the event is the event, and the truth of the event stands as straight and firm as the shortest line between any two points. Everything else is an approximation, and the closest approximation, the truest rendition of the event itself, will, in the long run, always triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, lies plays dirty - which one should always except from some low-life like that. It is the name of his game. And of course, we, even if we are truthsayers, need him, to always keep us clear of the distinction, so that we can better hone our ability to discern the actual Truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember one simple truth, and that is lies cannot hide the truth. They can only blind us to the truth, by causing us to look at what they are presenting - generally with more pazaz and glitter, more noise and impact. We are so like children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;vision:-a-web-of-communities&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Vision: A web of communities &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#vision:-a-web-of-communities&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectives of co-operation, clusters of affinity groups, like mycelium - feeding, supporting, using... a communications, transport and information network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have named it “The Tree of Life Network”. It is essentially a collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/sustainable.html&quot;&gt;communities&lt;/a&gt; made up of like-minded people. A place where those who feel a deep mistrust of the current structure can gather, and begin to design &amp;amp; build the society that we imagine, while being supported by a vast network co-ordinating and communicating the efforts of all these cultural creatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change oneself is the most difficult battle, to change a community is multiples more difficult. We need to evolve into a better system of social governance and trade relations, and can no longer be reliant on the present system. The only way to do that is to fashion a more effective system, one that better represents the reality of our global societies, not to waste our energy fighting &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; the current system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not here to convince you of anything, or to change your mind. We are not going to sing pretty songs to seduce you to follow our path. I say, either you know the truth, and are waiting to hear the call. What is commonly known as the call to freedom - &amp;quot;Let my people go&amp;quot;. But the only freedom we have is who/what we wish to serve - unless we have encountered the evil force which allows no choice, only obedience and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bible: Tale of exodus started of with a request for the community to go into the wilderness for 3 days to pray. Today, we exist in a situation where the pharaoh is refusing to allow us to gather and pray - not in our homes, nor our temples, not even in the wilderness are we allowed to gather in prayer any longer in many places in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there exists another way, we have to manifest it - not just dream of it, not just speak of it. The question is, how do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up till now we have sought the One, the enlightened prophet, who will lead us to the Holy Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bible: Tale of exodus did not start off with a community seeking their Holy Land. They were not driven by a vision of living a &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; life - just of being free from the bondage of their overlords. Moses did not speak to the people, inspiring them with a vision of life in a Holy Land flowing with milk and honey. No - he spoke to the pharaoh! Only once they had been released from the bondage of the Pharaoh, and he was defeated, did they arrive at Sinai to receive the Torah. Like sheep whose gate some angel had opened, they rushed out of their paddock, not caring nor knowing where they were going. Thank G-d, their prophet led them to Sinai and the Torah. They had been chosen. How many of them even knew this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bible cont: It was surely a shock for most, to be suddenly put upon by thunder and lightening, and then told they are Chosen, and need to obey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it any different nowadays? Has it changed? How many would readily leave their bondage to ascend on a journey into the wilderness? There was no vision that led the people out of Egypt, but perhaps they were driven by desperation - they, in essence, had little other hope for anything to ever improve. Is that not often the Sophie&#39;s Choice of members of any society? Either submit to the current regime and obey, benefiting from its boons, and accepting the yokes of its authority? Is that not how all groupings work - whether physical, or social, or cultural? And when it starts becoming extreme, and more authoritarian, and filled with fear and threats and betrayals and violence, what choice do you have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know the current system will not readily assent to that change. It will seem like the invasion of a foreign body, or that something foreign/uncomfortable is growing within it. It will try and absorb it, and if not then isolate it until it can destroy or remove it. Thus, essentially, it is not us that are pockets of resistance, but the system that is resisting us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the people, have to pull ourselves out of this mess. In order not to fall into another version of the same theme, however, we need to dream, sing &amp;amp; pray, and build together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These communities are connected by affinities, forming a connected web. Within that network, we begin to co-ordinate, regulate, and maintain local, distributed networks, experimenting, exploring and building &lt;em&gt;alternatives&lt;/em&gt; to the current way of interacting and transacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Jihadist movements offer the people - an alternative way of life. Not that most of them want the to live under repressive Islamic regimes, but they prefer that to the Christian, capatalist way of life. The freedoms that the Western Civilizations offer, are less appealing than the constraints that the Islamic way of life imposes. In the West, we would of course believe that it is imposed on them by the authorotarian patriarchal adherents to the religion, but that is convenient and fits into the correct narrative - from the perspective of the Western mind. However, by the same token, the Islamic adherents could respond with the same analysis of what is occurring in what believes it is the &amp;quot;freest country in the world, a beacon of freedom to all the oppressed of the world&amp;quot;, the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this present time is that we don’t have to design it – it already exists and is widely manifest in all the big IT arena (Google, FB, etc)[cloud.html] - what we call the Cloud - we just have to adapt it to our use. The technology would be the same technology. It is just those who wield it whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/finite_games.html&quot;&gt;intentions and goals&lt;/a&gt; will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I will mention, is that the web is formed from the people who are members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/networks.html&quot;&gt;network&lt;/a&gt;. It can manifest any structure of connectivity that they wish to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two examples of this are the internet and the net of Indra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet consists of a vast collection of objects (computers) that are all connected via a complex set of protocols and lines of communication. It does not restrict whatever structure wishes to appear, for it forms an underlying web of connectivity that can be activated along lines chosen by the people themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net of Indra is a vision of living spirits that comes from ancient Hindu texts. It speaks of our existences as jewels that sit in a vast network of light. And at certain points of intersection on this vast interconnected web, where there is enough energy, appear the jewels of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;concept&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Concept &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#concept&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I know about this concept?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternative:&lt;br /&gt;
That non-hierarchical communication structures are viable and effective (eg: web), but that there is a need for other type of structures too.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a work that has been done to devise various methods of analysing &amp;amp; organising such relationship graphs into various structures to facilitate connectivity. There are also particularly effective ways of ordering these connections to facilitate the spread of information and a fuller expression of the relationships existant and in potentia between the participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire:&lt;br /&gt;
There is a huge desire amongst all peoples to be engaging in communities of trust and support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will/Commitment:&lt;br /&gt;
Is there sufficient will?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complexity:&lt;br /&gt;
That there is a critical mass, a point at which people will be able to see and understand the concept.&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/systems.html&quot;&gt;complex systems&lt;/a&gt;. Until then, it will require faith and commitment from all its members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economics:&lt;br /&gt;
As a tree requires sap to live, so this tree will require currency - to evaluate interactions - that are the sap of our lives, and to flourish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network structure:&lt;br /&gt;
A form of this structure exists in almost all organisations. As a graph, it is a generalisation of all organisational structure - similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/waves.html&quot;&gt;wave&lt;/a&gt;. What I wish to create is the structure on which this can express itself. This is, in fact, just an example of the way all social movements and in fact, all effective social constructs have organised themselves throughout the ages. All brotherhoods, guilds and ruling elites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits/SpinOffs:&lt;br /&gt;
Once the network manifests, there will be many spin-offs - just as we saw with the internet, and its spawn, the Web. It is about clearing and prepping the ground for the seeds to be planted, creating fertile ground for other expressions of the paradigm shift to emerge. It will be a space for projects, structures and applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organic:&lt;br /&gt;
Natural structures - &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/affinity_groups.html&quot;&gt;affinity groups&lt;/a&gt; - emerge organically from this network structure, as groups that share an affinity to something, or some idea, or some expression - whether religious, creative, or other. These groups would cluster, as affinity groups, organised by purpose, creating networks woven within networks. This is an expression of the multi-dimensional/multi-layered aspects of our very existence.&lt;br /&gt;
And this HAS already happened. Except this very natural social phenomenon, the desire for connection, has been subverted by economic imperatives of the current imperialist system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organisation:&lt;br /&gt;
The primal connection is the personal one, so at its base it will be organised by physical proximity primarily – that is those that live physically close and wish/are able to share some energy. They organise themselves in another network of the same structure, but connected by shared purpose, (or idea, or project)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collectives, co-operatives, clubs - whatever form of co-operation suits them and their needs.&lt;br /&gt;
For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/new_energy.html&quot;&gt;solar power projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive:&lt;br /&gt;
This is not an absolute, one size fits all, type of solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralised:&lt;br /&gt;
It aims for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/descentralised.html&quot;&gt;decentralised system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fractal:&lt;br /&gt;
Fractal nature of the structure. It manifests the same structure at all levels. This is how one maintains the integrity of the structure. It has many similarities to present infrastructures, but has smaller distances between each level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal-of-the-nw:&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Goal of the n/w: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#goal-of-the-nw:&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the network is concerned, the basic concept is to create a sovereign, independent network, that will rely on the public network as little as is practically possible. It will local mesh networks, home based servers providing resources and protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideal&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Ideal &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#ideal&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creating a dynamic balance between a centralised control based paradigm and local sovereignty/empowerment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tree-power-dynamics&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Tree power dynamics &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#the-tree-power-dynamics&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the structure itself is not the new, it will enable, under the correct conditions, for a new foundation to emerge. One which enable the emergence of entities and communities that can support and maintain and allow this new paradigm to stabilise and arise as a relevant influence on the current paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses the principle of “when the people lead, the leaders will follow”. The power comes from below, facilitated by the power which is above. There is enough will and creativity amongst all of us who envision another way of relating to the world around us to manifest the world we wish to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expressive form of the network is tree like, which represents a more natural hierarchy: &amp;quot;the less the power and the greater the area of responsibility, the less the power. Whilst the smaller the domain, the greater the power &amp;amp; &#39;individual&#39; sovereignty, as well as greater decision making power.&amp;quot; This allows for the ultimate responsibility to lie on as low a level as is feasible. It envisages a structure that functions on the local level with global reach/functionality as well. An expression of the 70&#39;s slogan, &amp;quot;Act locally, think globally&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;by-the-people-for-the-people&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;By the people, for the people &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#by-the-people-for-the-people&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local empowerment is created by a truly representative system in which each voice can be heard. The Network is a technology to enable such a system. This non-hierarchical principle is etched into the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each decision will be made by consensus &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/partial_consensus.html&quot;&gt;partial consensus&lt;/a&gt; and even the dissenting voices will be recorded and acknowledged. No one will be excluded from the decision making process and this is manifest on all levels of the network. This mechanism will be embedded in the network structure itself – or more accurately – in the protocols of communication of the network itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to prevent the network from being overrun by unnecessary &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot;, chatter, etc, is by organising the network into cells of maximum 12 active members. Their collective voice is the voice that is heard in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weave a web, a global village, within the infrastructure of the world as it is today. As each person is ready, he or she alone or within a group, will decide to begin the &lt;em&gt;aliyah&lt;/em&gt; (up-rising) to the (w)hole(y) land, where we will grow our seeds in that land promised to us - the world we have dreamt of living in, &lt;em&gt;olam ha-bah&lt;/em&gt;, and have the freedom to have whatever relationship with the Divine we are able. But, this time, we cannot be led by a prophet to this new world, instead, we have to both learn both how to receive and how to build this new world. Those that are not ready, but have the same dream, support this web, enable it, from outside, praying and working with all of us towards the day that we will all have completed our journey and able to engage in the land flowing with milk and honey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then will begin the real work, of sustaining it for the coming generations...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1st goal: Create n/w (IT)&lt;br /&gt;
1st stage: People transition to n/w (Marketing)&lt;br /&gt;
2nd goal: create reasonably self-sufficient, but productive, areas (Building)&lt;br /&gt;
2nd stage: enable people to transition to working in areas of production and supply (Enabling)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect all cultural creatives in clusters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count all votes to decide an issue (vote) = popular democracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everybody has an vote – might be influenced by distance from the issue at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organic, creating company (corporeation) to support our lives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a structure upon which we can begin to build a New Paradigm (NP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loose enough to allow expression,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coherent enough to enable collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Emergence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable collaboration between, emergence of, all various positive expressions of this paradigm (ala positive deviance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods to deal with inevitable negative expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable creation of pockets, spaces, in which the expression can take place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable people to transition their energy from feeding the current paradigm to feeding the NP. (Wolf story)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organise network into tree structure with parent(s) part of “parent” group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All decisions percolate up the tree via the parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used for communication, and organisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have felt sense of a structure, almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/ark.html&quot;&gt;Ark&lt;/a&gt; (Noah&#39;s)&lt;br /&gt;
I have an idea of a place to start. But I cannot do it alone. I need all your help; and even that of all your relations. Everyone who dreams of this way, has &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; with whom he has dreamt this dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a very natural structure that will enable us to usher a way to survive, while providing, encouraging, empowering the space to express our sacred being. A space within which there is the possibility of greater resonance amongst ourselves and our fellow beings and the environment. Another way to exist. But we have to do the work. It is not going to magically transform. We are the 3d, material expression of all that happens to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to build this structure, connecting all who believe in a more human(e) way of life in the world – physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. A world that is founded on truth and trust. A world in which we can be and are kind(er) to ourselves and to one another. By this connection we build the structure that will be alive with the expression of this dream - the dream of all who are oppressed and live in bondage - that we all share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;web&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Web &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#web&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web arose from our deep desire for connectivity with one another. In addition, we would like more connection with and control over all the basic aspects of our lives, especially the critical ones like water, food, air, house, health, energy, education, sewage, clothing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce that all to one single unit of measurement, money, is diabolical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web provides a moving picture of the relationships between people. And as such can be used to more accurately forecast social movements. Just like the weather stations collect samples over a spread of space and time and thus can predict our weather, fairly accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web is expressing a certain coherence to enable efficient communication between the nodes of the network. Each tier is structured similarly, and is layered to allow for more efficient transmission of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one mapped a Tree of Life onto that already existing web, it would provide a structure upon which to build another sort of interaction and transaction that is more attuned to US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web already exists. The Tree of Life Network, which is a mapping of our coherence, doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that we will have more freedom once the basic necessities of life are taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/freedom.html&quot;&gt;Freedom&lt;/a&gt; for... what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organise in self-similar manner&lt;br /&gt;
Image: Seeds of Life gather to form a Flower of Life, which we call a lotus - or locus - of life, and it becomes the focus of your life. Each cluster will eventually connect to every other. In the meantime, we continue to plant the seeds which grow into trees, for within the flowers is a structure called the Tree of Life. This structure is a key that opens at least one portal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only purpose of the tree like structure of the n/w is to disseminate information amongst the nodes. It will collect and collate this information, so that we can draw a map of the body that we are part of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smallest unit is “affinity group” organised with an &lt;em&gt;abba&lt;/em&gt; or and &lt;em&gt;imma&lt;/em&gt; or both.&lt;br /&gt;
Each affinity group clusters around a sacred center, like an honeycomb&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verified &lt;strong&gt;info&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
The network will provide access to all information. But will differentiate between that which has been verified, and that which has not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also contain access to lists of people/companies offering products or services who are part of the network and as such are answerable to this community. Can verify the company too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Groups list what they require. As it percolates up the network it aggregates, and the figures become more realistic for the larger network, and if there is a large enough desire, someone should step forward to supply this product to the consumer. It will give people incentives to begin such enterprises having an idea of what this market is.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With consolidation and focus of purchasing power will enable us to focus our energy and resources to make this more natural and organic lifestyle to be sustained and made more easily available to members and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we can produce candidates and support politicians that vote in the support of life and not money/material/death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- A place where you can live a more earthly/human lifestyle.
- A place where we can seek and find for this more holistic lifestyle.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A place where your voice will be heard. A way in which we can express our opinions and our vote will make a difference. A place where everyone is involved to whatever extent they wish to be in any and all decisions. Something we call [_partial consensus_](consensus.html)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal would be to be fully connected, however this is not possible. It would require way too much resources to build, let alone maintain. Need to be organised more efficiently so that the process is streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of this proposal is change the foc use the incredible technologies that already exist in the realm of computers to connect people instead of hardware and/or software (apps). That the very technologies that enable computers to connect, monitor, react, spawn, maintain, design and architect be used to connect us and be used to further humanities needs and desires, instead of a small elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the current technologies to create people-centric, instead of computer-centric networks. This is what the web spawned, and the FB&#39;s &amp;amp; Googles of the world perfected. The defect in the model appeared when, in order to succeed (financially) in the current socio-economic climate, it had to adopt the current model, and, run according to the dynamics of a successful business. However, when you are using technology in a unique fashion, and producing something new, your model begins to define the future of business, and thus, the regulatory systems of the current system are left in the dust, trying to grapple with the new, barely understood, models that are now dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, those that succeeded in managing the human/social interactions on this massive scale, were shaped by the environment in which they thrived. What if these same technologies - often freely or easily available - were harnessed to benefit the participants, and not primarily economically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My belief is that any governing/managing/supervising leadership role is first and foremost to ensure that those who are under its care have their basic needs taken care of. This, in itself, is a massive task. &amp;quot;First, take care of the elderly, the widow &amp;amp; the orphan.&amp;quot; But that will bring much peace and prosperity to the people. If we could have a global system that ensured that, it could bring much stability to the world as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to do that? By a massively global system of co-operation and co-ordination to ensure that the system&#39;s balance is maintained That will also require other re-assessments, that will have to be agreed upon. If a group, or community do not wish to practice in the same way, there is no requirement or enforcement thereof. They are welcome to participate in any and all of our social or business ventures - but they may not have restricted access and rights within the network itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are welcome to participate in our exchange system as well. It is based purely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/energy_exchange.html&quot;&gt;energy exchange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe that our hearts are all aligned with the same basic desires for peace of mind, for forgive ness, for love, for upliftment of one another. That we are on the same team, and can recognise one another energetically. Have faith in this vision that we all hold in our hearts of a peaceful world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an aspect of privacy, of confidentiality (in confidence) that is required to be maintained in the network. Thus it spreads by word of mouth, and the stuff of the network is kept within the confines of the network. The container must be sturdy to hold the energy, otherwise it is always leaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If 1000 people could think one thought, have a common goal, and work towards it.... Unity is strength&lt;br /&gt;
What if 1000 became 100,000, what would the effect be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 1 million – what that be enough to change the course of humanity’s future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is extremely simple, based on one of the oldest ideas around “Unity is strength. Divided we fall, united we stand”. The more people we can get acting in a co-ordinated way to produce the kind of lifestyle they dream of, environmentally and in other areas, that is, the more results we will be able to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are easily more than a million of us with the same dream, with the same desire. We know and have known for a while now that if we do not do something soon, we are going to enter some extremely difficult times - which have now arrived. I know, I know, we have been hearing it for years, and look, everything looks fine - doesn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were 1 million people acting in accordance, dedicated and working fulltime to creating and building a more sustainable way of life, if they were all dedicated to living and maintaining such a system, incorporating the humanistic values that we all revere, the world would already be a different place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are there a million of us who are willing to organise into a coherent unit and face the onslaught of the current paradigm? To man the bridges, so as to say, and hold off the attackers, until the climate changes to be more accepting of another way of life - or one or the other side dies trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tree&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The Tree &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#the-tree&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tree is the shape/entity that emerges/forms out of the background of the Web of Life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NOTE:
Must stop referring to it as a tree. That is what confuses people. I must refer to it as the Web of Life, the Web of Truth, the Web of Trust.
Does the Web of Truth &amp;amp; Trust = Web of Life?
When asked: Why a Tree (of Life Network)? That will only be explained to those who can understand.

Perhaps, at the present stage of the game, we do not need affinity groups, a reason to collaborate. There seems to be more pressing and real reasons to gather.

Let us refer to the leaf group as a node or pod or cell or family.
Cells cluster.
Then we form collectives.
Then we form corporeations.
Then we are crowned with sovereignty.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. In order to move from the current paradigm requires a non-hierarchical, self-sustaining  system that will more accurately map our future needs, and thus enable us to use that information to more efficiently direct our energy towards the human potential to be realised.
2. In order to change the current paradigm we need to enhance the current pyramidical framework to enable and empower the people, who form the nodes at the edges of the system – the so-called leaves of the tree.  This is done by creating a system, a coherent connected network in which the leaf nodes are heard and can be acknowledged.
3. This new system can be manifested by a hierarchy called a tree, that is dedicated to a purpose that enables the leaf nodes to be empowered by their access to the benefits and channels of communication and organisation provided by the greater network. This is an expression of the local empowerment with global reach.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space to be, without unnecessary fear.&lt;br /&gt;
I envisage freedom as the space and the resources to express that creative energy that lurks inside me and is begging to be allowed to manifest in my life.&lt;br /&gt;
Each day I am in gratitude for the blessing of the constraint in which my spirit, which yearns to be free, is bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing the pattern. The pattern that makes up the structure is coherent in a fractal sense, in that it repeats itself from the smallest component to the largest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each point, at each breath, I imagine the infinite walking into the rabbit hole of the fractal. But I fear no evil for the universe is coherent (&amp;amp; the Lord is my witness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form of fractal coherence which allows for greater space of movement (Mei Wan Ho’s: The crystal is the form that allows the greatest degrees of freedom). Freedom is found by balancing constraint. Only by acknowledging myself as part of the web of life, can I find the place that I can truly be. In the truth of my being I acknowledge that the totality is far larger that I could ever know, that I exist in a web, as a jewel in the Net of Indra.&lt;br /&gt;
The fractal is embedded in the I of each of us. I embrace the web of which my life is woven, the net of my life following the strand of convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smallest component is to be that of triangles.&lt;br /&gt;
If you are an individual, find 2 people who are part of the network, and join that triangle. Or find 2 friends who are willing to participate therein, and form a triangle with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, what is that you wish to build?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you need?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can you offer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two triangles, arranged correctly form a .... square!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will form into groups of 3 or 4 triangles, forming affinity circles of 9 - 12 of these triangles.&lt;br /&gt;
This group meets less frequently, and is used as the collection point, or bridge, for this circle.&lt;br /&gt;
The information from this circle is then propagated up in the same manner, 1 connection from each circle propagating upwards to the next level of collation. Thus decisions can be heard, and will be collected and propagated further in the network essentially by quantity of votes, and hopefully no other criterion. [I say hopefully here, because there might have to be some caveats introduced here for who knows what the future holds.] Which will by then be connected to the greater network, and just have administrative function within the structure itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We unify because we truly want the same things. We don’t unify because we want to be able to express our own individual truth. But now that we have individuated, how do we cohere again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity is strength:
Unity of purpose,
Unity of mind,
Unity of heart,
Unity of morals
Sworn to non-violence.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-the-network&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Join the network &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#join-the-network&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide you with all the information publicly and easily available regarding you.&lt;br /&gt;
Provide you with a map of all your relationships, interests, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
Help asses, define &amp;amp; decide what to do with the information.&lt;br /&gt;
Goal is to identify others who would benefit from and be beneficial to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by identifying what you are interested in.// This can now be done by mining public data.&lt;br /&gt;
So you form affinity group in your present life. Identify all the people who make up this affinity group. Ideally it is people you know, friends preferably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;affinity&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Affinity &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#affinity&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spontaneous/natural liking/attraction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;relationship (marriage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;resemblance in structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;similarity in structure, spiritual distance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suggesting a relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affinity group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;group of people linked by common purpose/interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All fractals include the imaginary, and the infinite. Then begin to express a form that replicates itself at each layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;group-dynamics:&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Group dynamics: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#group-dynamics:&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If issue has 5/5 split, report it as 5/5 split to next level. That collects report from 10 other such groups and collates information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to maintain the balance between group and individual?&lt;br /&gt;
e.g. How to prevent solar panel company from pushing its product?&lt;br /&gt;
By needing it to spread locally and organically.&lt;br /&gt;
No blanket marketing? The person will ask for the product from that supplier, because it is the only one, or the most local one, or the best one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parent takes on the responsibility of facilitating the communication with the n/w, and thus takes on extra by being on both the groups. There is also the possibility of the parent of the child group communicating with one of the members of the “parent” group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sponsors&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Sponsors &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#sponsors&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the sponsors. The person that brought that individual (or group) into the network. If there is an altercation, we call on the sponsor, who should know the person personally, to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cluster&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Cluster &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#cluster&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster around sacred centre place for inner work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organise by affinity groups of 10, preferably physically connected, by a web-like structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instance: Religious Jewish communities have to cluster within walking distance around a synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difference is that we do not gather around one person. But by acknowledging the sacred, we gather wherever there is a group of 10 or more members. Thus we have the jewels appearing around whom we gather and support.&lt;br /&gt;
Previous paradigm: honour 1 person, man, chief, priest, king. Now honour yourself and through that honour, everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;
So it is with intention – hallow everything.&lt;br /&gt;
Aspect of this work, and this network – there is nowhere to hide. All is being “recorded” and responded to. Thoughts are now alive and affect your brain and everything around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;truth-temples&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Truth temples &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#truth-temples&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We welcome the diversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support building of network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All decisions, requests... percolate down from the leaves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organise around purpose, and goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;communications-network&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Communications network &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/old/tae_questions/#communications-network&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communications network upon which appear dynamic, purpose-driven webs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does it go from this to a network of identifiable leaves and nodes all interconnected, and communicating in a self-replicating fashion? A lot of work. A lot of software needs to be manifested, and the information needs to be input and organised correctly. This will all require a fair amount of engineering time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People join and participate &amp;quot;For the greatest good of all&amp;quot;. Because &amp;quot;Together we stand, divided we fall&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/personal/#the-muddling-mystic&quot;&gt;The muddling mystic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-muddling-mystic&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The muddling mystic &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://neshama.com/posts/tolnet/personal/#the-muddling-mystic&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have studied esoteric lore since a young age. Firstly through tradition and culture, and then after my 13th year, I began to explore the texts of other faiths and mystical movements. By my 40’s my exploration was focussed on Kabbalah and its teachings, when I began entering into a more deeply and more shamanically based teaching. That was the key, and it all fell into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understood how it worked – not perfectly, of course for I am human and limited by my constraints. But I understood deeply, I had attained some wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the difficulty was what to do with it. As I became more deeply steeped in these teachings, so I seemed to become less grounded, less able, in the “real” world. It confused me how we all are bathed in the light, but yet continue to seek and toy with the darkness and chaos. How there is a deep longing in us for the darkness, almost an embedded need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sages say that we are born with two inclinations – one the good inclination, the other the evil. And we have free choice in this matter, and can follow the path of the good or choose the evil path. Then one of the masters pointed out that most of us are &lt;em&gt;benonim&lt;/em&gt; – walk the middle ground, with some bad and some good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He obviously was embracing the relativistic model, which says that the important thing is what is your intention, what is your goal, what are your thoughts on the matter? Are they good? Or are they evil? In fact, he is merciful enough to ask whether most of your thoughts lean towards the good or towards the evil – for to be perfectly good is attained by only a few righteous souls. And no one can be truly evil, for everyone, everything that exists in Creation has to have a spark of Divine (Creator) light in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light of that analysis, I have done little evil in my life. I am not monogamous, which is looked at as a sin in our culture – due to the commandment against adultery. Though it was in a polygamous society in which the stricture not to sleep with a woman who you are not wedded to. Though Abraham and Jacob had non-adulterous relations with woman who were not their wives, but their wives maidservants.&lt;br /&gt;
This was a time were sex was not the issue, but offspring. When Jacob slept with ??? on the road, thinking she was a harlot – which seemed to be acceptable behaviour – for that was not what was the issue at hand, but that she had become pregnant out of wedlock. That is what branded her a harlot, not seducing some guy on the side of the road. Nor was he in any way culpable – until she proved that it was him. It was not about love – that she loved him and wanted him, but about the child and inheritance rights. This was a world in which sex was like any other natural event of the human existence. It was about the material rights in this world expressed through children – the most important event in a person’s life, as it meant that there was a possible future. It was a time when the pulse of life flowed strongly through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are at a conundrum now. We have enough people on the planet. We do not need more – and might need less. Yet we still believe that one of our basic rights and needs is to bear children. It has gone from an imperative to a right. All the energy of this life force is no longer needed to only procreate – it needs to be channelled into other directions, for if it is not diverted into positive actions, it will become expressed in negative ones. The rapist is seldom one who is sexually fulfilled in his life – unless he has had a certain trauma that has caused a psychotic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the stepping from adolescent to adult behaviour, taking charge of our future as a collective. No longer deluded that, except for a very few, anyone can exist on his or her own. To become more aware of all it takes just to exist on this earth as a human being from all the resources that are needed – food, water, air, clothes, shelter, energy, transport for the basics; then entertainment, work, education, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure cannot survive with a tiny few having more than a vast majority of people. That is just not right. In fact, it might be downright evil. You decide. Remembering that whether you are part of the elite or part of the disenfranchised economically, that might taint your response. Because it is natural for a system – just like a living being, because in fact all our systems are in the end run and fed by human beings – to want to survive, and do everything and anything it needs to do survive. However, this system is killing us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the first and most important goal here would be to distinguish between good and evil. Though that could be relative – as we see often enough in our world. When good is fighting evil, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two in the heat of the battle. Is it acceptable to do evil things for a good cause? Is it acceptable to do the same evil things that evil does in the battle against evil? To an established order, those that threaten its stability are branded terrorists and looked at as evil, because they kill innocent citizens. Though these people, who rose up against an order that has been established by tyranny and fear, and are fighting for freedom and human rights, are not truly evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is it your thoughts? Or the reason that you do these terrible things that determines whether they are terrible or not? Is it just the circumstances and the reasons you do these things that is the ultimate criterion of good or evil? If I do it “for God” - as I perceive Him – is that good? Even if I kill and maim and torture and hurt and enslave other beings? Is that what God wants from us? To kill one another? To hurt one another? Is that God’s plan? His purpose for creation – a fight club, where millions fight and die?&lt;br /&gt;
If that is the case, it is reaching absurd heights. For no longer will there be wars or battles between peoples and nations, it will just mean annihilation – perhaps for that nation, or perhaps for the entire humanity. A number of flashes in the sky is what for many will be there last moment, while for many others a slow, bleeding death – lingering for many years, till we are all gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are living in a world run by a lot of sabre rattling madmen. Though to upset everything, you only have to have one of these madmen to create a mad scenario. There is only one motivation for people of this ilk, and it is power. That is evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All dynamic/moving systems are alive. If a system never changes, then it is dead. If a food can stand open for a long time, then it is dead. All static, absolute, unmoving systems are dead. Thus sterilized systems or pasteurised food stuffs are often life depleting. Though there is must support and nourishment that a dead tree or animal provides the living creature of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
