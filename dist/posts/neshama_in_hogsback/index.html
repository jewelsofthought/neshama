<p>There are two parts to this document. In the first part I will explain what I understood from our conversations, and the second part is how I would present it in a short description for the website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kabbalah is a science of the spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="5-souls" tabindex="-1">5 souls <a class="direct-link" href="#5-souls" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The Kabbalah does not recognize the soul as a single entity, but rather separates the soul into 5 elements; <em>Nefesh</em>, <em>Ruach</em>, <em>Neshamah</em>, <em>Chayah</em>, and <em>Yechidah</em>.</p>
<p><em>Nefesh</em> is our bodily soul, our vivifying soul. Vivified means ‘to bring to life’, so this is the part of our soul which which awakens at birth, upon inhabiting this body. It is that soul which is experiencing this physical existence, through its having become entangled in this physical representation, your bodies, Thus it becomes aware and reacts to the sensations of our physical body in the physical world. This soul, whose nomenclature also represents “rest”, is placed in surroundings that are known as the “Realm of Action/Doing” (<em>Assiyah</em>) It is represented in modern psychology as the ego, and it is what “holds” or “forms” us here. It is also a veil, (and a bridge) or barrier (with portals) between the conscious and “unconscious”, the “body” and the “soul”.</p>
<p><em>Ruach</em>, the next level of our soul, means ‘spirit’. The manifestation of <em>Ruach</em> is in our <a href="feelings.html">feelings</a>{It is necessary to differentiate between feelings and emotions. Feelings as the sensations that your body is experiencing. Emotions as the &quot;feelings/thoughts&quot; that are manifest/experienced as an, almost cognitive - one could say imaginative/imaginary - response to the &quot;initial&quot; sensations.} This realm is also known as the realm of formation. Our feelings form us, not our emotions. In every aspect of this teaching (almost), there is an upper and a lower aspect. Think of it as the front and the back, or the above and the below. I stand between heaven above me and the earth below me. I am referring here to an earth that is as vast as the heavens. Like the firmament that separated the upper waters from the lower one. Thus emotion would be the lower aspect of this energy, and feelings the upper. Look at the word itself: emote &amp; e-motion, both referring to something that “comes out of”, “sticks out of”. If I emote – I express my anger, or pain, or sadness in an emotional, often dramatic sense. But when I have a feeling, of love, or compassion, it comes from something that is authentically mine. It is this feeling, this aspect of the energy, that will form the “things” of my life. For the truth of it is that it, this upper feeling, comes from above. And the training is to recognize that, discern that which comes from above and the which comes from below.</p>
<p>This part of our soul has the awareness of emotion. More like, it is the expression of these feelings &amp; emotions. The “forms” that make up how we experience and what we do in our lives. This is the reactive part of our soul and our heart-space.One might see it as the heart-space (in modern parlance). But the heart-space in Kabbalah is contained in the body! The <em>sefirah</em> that represents it is called <em>Tipheret</em>, [I thought I had installed the Hebrew keyboard on this document editor, but have not, and do not want to get distracted by doing it, so I will continue, and later install Hebrew] and it is known as Beauty.</p>
<p>One could also conceive of <em>Ruach</em> as between <em>Nefesh</em> &amp; <em>Neshama</em>, with <em>Ruach</em> being the lower, more dense expression of <em>Neshama</em>. Ruach has been described as the “wind upon which the light travels”</p>
<p><em>Neshamah</em> is related to the intellect - which speaks of the realm of thought, and it is this realm that our &quot;conscious&quot; awareness of G-d arises. It is the thoughts from which we proceed. Upon meeting someone, the thoughts we think will make a huge difference to our future. Only later do we “feel” something – for the realm of <em>Ruach</em> is denser, and thus energy travels slower. Here is the true act of creation taking place, and it exists as an expression of the realm that is called <em>Beriah</em>, or <em>Creation/Creativity</em>. It is the place (source) from which our thoughts are manifest – that is become conscious. And everything of which we are aware has to have passed through this realm. <em>Neshamah</em> is the place where we feel the <em>Ruach</em> (wind) of of the Divine energy. The primary activity of <em>Neshamah</em> is to become wise, – and the only way to do this is to seek G-d (etc...). <em>Neshamah</em> is of the essential rather than the ephemeral, and as such is an expression of your soul purpose, or your soul desire, or your soul mate . For the true purpose of your soul, your sole purpose, can never change for the &quot;lifetime&quot; of the soul. I would say that a sign of a person who has reached this level of consciousness and operates from this part of the soul is when you see a person dedicated to understanding the Divine, and is shining in and with Divine light.</p>
<p>It is understood that at any moment in creation G-d is breathing, if this ever stops, creation will disappear! <em>Neshamah</em> is the in-breath, <em>Ruach</em> is the exhalation, manifested as creation. We, as created beings, breath in the <em>Neshamah</em> of God, “Breath of God” or “Holy Spirit” and breathe out our own creations – through our lives.<br>
Perhaps you could meditate on the Trinity here – as <em>Neshama</em> – the Holy Ghost, <em>Ruach</em> as God, the father, and <em>Nefesh</em>, as God made “flesh”. Which, as Jesus has said, is all of us: &quot;We are all children of God&quot;, he said. Each and everyone of us, is G-d in flesh...</p>
<p>The fourth level, <em>Chayah</em> speaks of the Divine Will that causes creation to manifest. It can only be experienced, it cannot be described. It is like the electricity flowing down the wire. The fifth level is one in which the soul is deep into its soul journey, in a realm so far above our understanding that words are inadequate to express it. Our only hope is to listen to the reports of those who have “visited” this space and managed to connect with It clearly enough to return with a message. The questionable aspect of these records is the uncertainty of what effect the journey of return had upon the message, let alone the messenger.</p>
<p>We speak of these 5 levels of soul in order for us to better understand and relate to the experience of the world around and in us. So, for practicality, we focus on the first 3 levels, which are the most pertinent to our present exploration, <em>Nefesh</em>, <em>Ruach</em> &amp; <em>Neshama</em>.</p>
<p>These ‘elements’ are also levels of consciousness – this I can see. <em>Nefesh</em> consciousness people would operate from their base chakra mostly, <em>Ruach</em> consciousness people will operate from their emotions mostly, then there are those who are living in and seeking <em>Neshamah</em>, seeking to understand G-ds’ soul. This is good.</p>
<h2 id="archetypes" tabindex="-1">Archetypes <a class="direct-link" href="#archetypes" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>A caution here: Because we are speaking in archetypical language, be careful of latching on to a specific meaning. It is necessary to keep the broader area in view, because we are seeking wisdom – and that requires penetrating the essence – the Divine spark hidden in all manifest/material things. All archetypes are symbols of something far larger than the name itself.</p>
<p>So to give you an example, I will fill out some of the “meanings” of these names.</p>
<p><em>Nefesh</em>, from the realm of <em>Assiyah</em>, the realm of Doing, the manifest realm, also known as <em>Malkut</em>, the Kingdom, and thus know as the Kingdom of God – and we are His people. It contains the lower 6 sefirot/spheres of influence, or sapphires, in it – that make up the “body”.</p>
<p><em>Ruach</em>, from the realm of <em>Yetzirah</em>, the realm of Formation, the angelic realm, the realm where we have embodied, but not yet manifest. It has just one <em>sefirah</em>, Binah, the Supernal Mother, <em>Ima</em>, known as understanding. It is where the One splinters into its many forms, one of which is your <em>Nefesh</em>.</p>
<p><em>Neshama</em>, from the realm of <em>Beriah</em>, the realm of Creation, also know as the Throne Room, where there is the possibility of a meeting with <em>“Dmoot Elohim”</em>, the “Image of God (plural)”. The <em>sefirah</em> it is associated with is called <em>Chochmah</em>, Wisdom, and represents the Supernal Father, <em>Abba</em>, and it is where the two meet as one.</p>
<p>This was to give you a taste of the depths.</p>
<h2 id="and-deeper:" tabindex="-1">And deeper: <a class="direct-link" href="#and-deeper:" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p><em>Ruach</em> (the Mother) is a masculine word, and <em>Neshama</em> (the Father) is feminine – and is often indicative of the <em>Shechinah</em>, the Divine Feminine! Like the breath/energy/spirit that nourishes Her children.</p>
<p>Now the part that I wonder about is if we reach <em>Chayah</em> after death? Or is <em>Chayah</em> maybe manifested in Ascended masters here on earth? Or if <em>Chayah</em> is the ‘highest-self’, can we fully embody or attempt to embody our higher self in this life? Or do we move into that space momentarily from time to time? Also understanding it from a 4th dimensional concept – we do see we are very slowly moving into understanding that space. So does this then mean from this concept that when are on the <em>‘Neshamah’</em> journey, it might be possible to experience and live in <em>Chayah</em> at some point? I would like to discuss this more as many ideas go through my head on this one…<br>
Such lovely questions.</p>
<p>Though, I would caution you to be too concerned about after your death… That has its own dynamic, its own set of constraints. Let’s rather focus on the life we are living, for that is all that is certain.</p>
<p>Though it certainly seems that certain of us can Ascend to the level of <em>Chochmah</em> – where everything is seen as One. In order to manifest anything, and I mean anything, in this realm, the realm of <em>Assiyah</em>, Doing, we have to remove ourselves from the realm of Wisdom, and “enter”, or constrain our soul-selves to be able to “fit” into this dimension of interaction and communication that we are alive in. The same as if we are conscious of 4d and need to describe it in 3d terms, we would have to remove one axis of infinity to fit it into 3d… and that is an amazing thought…</p>
<p>Metaphorically, “we are the eyes and ears of God having a human experience”.</p>
<p>My conclusion is, that although it is possible to ascend to the upper realms, it is firstly impossible to remain there and remain active in this realm. Secondly, to do anything in the manifest realm, one cannot be still. Yet it is through stillness that you find guidance, and attain perspective. Thus even ascended masters will only be able to “visit” that realm – also by the very fact that we are existing here, therefore we can only be journeyers in any other realm. If we get stuck anywhere there, we are then most probably certifiably mad – living in a “disassociated” reality.</p>
<p>However, those whom have emerged as such Masters, are also people who have, generally through committed practice over years, “cleaned out their channels”, that is, opened and purified the connection between themselves and the upper realms, and having devoted such a lot of energy to learning and practising techniques to do so, results in their having better contact between these upper (and lower) realms.</p>
<h2 id="5-levels-of-soul" tabindex="-1">5 levels of soul <a class="direct-link" href="#5-levels-of-soul" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This is my understanding of the 5 levels of soul. They are interconnected and interdependent. One seeks balance so that the energy can flow easily from the one component to the next. If the <em>Nefesh</em> is taken care of, the <em>Ruach</em> functions easily – there is evidence of this in our physical and emotional bodies. If we are malnourished our emotions are unstable. If our emotions are unstable we sometimes neglect to take care of our bodies. Moving one up – if our emotions are balanced our minds are sharper and there is more space to contemplate and think about things – our <em>Neshamah</em>. This is where a lot of us are, or are striving to be at this point. A strong <em>Neshamah</em> element equals a healthy emotional and physical and mental disposition IF we are in balance with it. Our practice is to stay balanced in this, the narrow middle road. To find this balance we require discipline, practice, commitment, discernment, integrity and humility in our spiritual practice.</p>
<p>How to maintain that balance? Or how to find that balance? What is that balance? With what measurements do I judge balance?</p>
<p>With this in the background. As we investigate the crystal better, we will understand where the various energies sit and what they vibrate to. There was a piece I once read on the Kabbalah, and the phases of the moon. That it was better to do certain rituals on the specific full moon that channelled a specific sefirotic energy.<br>
On a last note we can also explain the 5 elements the following way – <em>Nefesh</em> being the body, <em>Ruach</em> being the spirit, <em>Neshamah</em> being the soul, <em>Chayah</em> is a part of G-ds’ soul, and <em>Yechidah</em> is unpronounable.</p>
<h2 id="part-two:-neshamah-in-hogsback" tabindex="-1">Part two: Neshamah in Hogsback <a class="direct-link" href="#part-two:-neshamah-in-hogsback" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>We refer to the work we do here as Soul Work – hence we have called our space “Neshamah”.</p>
<p>We recognize Neshamah in those seeking true spirituality. There is only one path to true spirituality; even though it has different cloaks. All ancient paths to true spirituality require discipline, practice, commitment, discernment, integrity and humility.</p>
<p>As one can only speak from one’s heart to another’s, so one can only do soul work from one soul to another, and in sacred space. And the only way to communicate soul-to-soul is through a hollow bone, a n “empty” channel.</p>
<p>The soul manifests through three elements, thought, emotion and action, yet its source is none of them, but it contains all three. Just as the soul may have levels that we need to explore rung by rung, so we need to gather the tools we will need for our journey from the wilderness to ascending Mount Horeb, the Mountain of Destruction, or would it be less scary to use its real name - the Mountain of Infinity.</p>
<p>At Neshamah - we recognize the body, mind spirit connection,<br>
At Neshama, we seek to focus on the essential rather than the ephemeral, and we welcome those seeking spiritual sustenance to engage in soul work so that we may all be able to live in this world with fullness of our hearts, our minds and our souls.</p>
