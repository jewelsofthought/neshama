	<h3>Description:</h3>
	<p>What was before the beginning?</p>

<h2 id="in-the-beginning" tabindex="-1">In the Beginning <a class="direct-link" href="#in-the-beginning" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>In the beginning, there was .... a becoming?</p>
<p>Darn! I'm already confused.</p>
<p>Let's try from another point. Before the beginning... there was.... nothing?</p>
<p>That makes no sense! Because how can there be a &quot;before&quot; when we are speak of existence itself. I mean, what existed before everything existed?</p>
<p>Ok, if you want to be really pedantic, you could claim that non-existence - a different kind of existence? - non-existed before existence. Does it now not exist anymore? Which brings in a very good question, the question of what does not exist because we of this existence?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to continue, it seems that, as far as we can cognite, our very existence &quot;begins&quot; at a certain point, just as we hypothesis for the &quot;birth of the universe&quot;, the Big Bang! Intrinsic in this view is a reflection of our own finite existence. We cannot really comprehend the concept of an endless universe - that is too grand for our finite minds. So, in order to speak of such things, we have to have a beginning <a href="time.html">Time Bound</a>, a &quot;point&quot; at which the story of our existence begins - which is referred to as <a href="beginning.html">&quot;In the beginning&quot;</a> <em>bereishit</em> בראשִׁת. &quot;In the beginning arose a single point&quot;, a singularity represented by &quot;in&quot;, the moment it all began.</p>
<p>Why is this point so important? Because it speaks of an <strong>imperfection</strong>, or apparent <a href="perfect.html">imperfection in the Perfection</a> that existed before. Like the tiniest stain on an otherwise white cloth.</p>
<p>Now let us speak of &quot;before&quot;.</p>
<p>'Long, long time ago, before time, and thus before before, in a place of absolutes - perfect silence, total peace, continuous perfection, absolute and complete ... nothing, no words, no actions, no sound - nothing could express this... no words, sounds thoughts or ideas (and that is why we call it <em>Nothing</em>).</p>

<ul>
<li>In the beginning
<ul>
<li>This phrase represents &quot;the beginning&quot;, the &quot;start&quot;, the &quot;first...&quot;.</li>
<li>Different from &quot;from the beginning&quot;</li>
<li>In/from:
<ul>
<li>In:
<ul>
<li>speaks of a position, a point/place in time. &quot;In the beginning&quot;</li>
<li>Represents a dynamic, circular motion, or angular momentum.
<ul>
<li>If &quot;beginning&quot; represents a point in time, what does &quot;in&quot; represent in this case?
<ul>
<li>This is where the language begins to play a part.</li>
<li><em>bereishit</em> means also &quot;first&quot;, so it could be translated as &quot;first G-d created...&quot;. Does that make it clearer?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At:
<ul>
<li>There is also a feeling of &quot;at the beginning&quot;. In the reading it is like an unfolding that takes place. It might have taken place so fast (or so slow) that we cannot fully comprehend it, but we know something really inspiring and amazing and wierd happend &quot;at that beginning&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From: speaks of a distance, a motion. &quot;From the very beginning&quot;.</li>
</ul>
