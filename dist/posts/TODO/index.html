<h2 id="adam-and-eve" tabindex="-1">Adam &amp; Eve <a class="direct-link" href="#adam-and-eve" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The story of why Eve took a bite of the apple, and offered one to Adam. Because she knew that this was G-d's design.</p>
<h2 id="atheist" tabindex="-1">Atheist <a class="direct-link" href="#atheist" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>An atheist, one who does not believe in G-d, and thus would not believe in a soul, or an afterlife, or reincarnation, etc - would then conclude that our brief existences are mere chance flashes in the pan of this random universe, and once we die, we die - it is over, kaput, ended. And the only way we could be remembered is by what we left behind. What monuments you built, or discoveries you stumbled upon - something that you would be recorded in the history of the victors. It is the most horrifying thought for a living being - one who is aware of his impending death. It is a cross which is uniquely human. No other animal seems to bear it as heavily as do we. Nevertheless, that looming abyss of death is a terrifying thought, and we will do anything to avoid it - even kill another. [An eye for an eye will produce a kingdom ruled by one-eyed men and women] Thus our &quot;health&quot; industry spent billions on keeping people alive! Helping sick people live healthy lives requires sick people. You product is health, but your inventory is sick people. If the majority of people were healthy, the &quot;health&quot; industry would fail!</p>
<p>So let's gather under the banner of life. Let's build a nation of people who live healthy lives. Let's provide one another with living food and clean living water first.</p>
<h2 id="decentralised-system" tabindex="-1">Decentralised system <a class="direct-link" href="#decentralised-system" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>It aims for a decentralised system that actively focuses on NOT preventing the less-fortunate people's access to the resources that they need to live decent lives. To have support and encouragement would be superb. However, I think the need for control is what requires those in power to strictly regulate ALL access to resources - ultimate power being the control of all access to every resource The network solution to that is, being powered by and from community groups their communal needs, not by obeying the commands of a centralised system with an overarching authority â€“ which is the kind of hierarchical control systems we have at present.</p>
<h2 id="energy-as-currency" tabindex="-1">Energy as Currency <a class="direct-link" href="#energy-as-currency" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>They are welcome to participate in our exchange system as well. It is based purely on energy exchange. It has two forms. The first is that of &quot;energy at rest&quot;, and it has a certain &quot;measure&quot;. The other is &quot;energy at work&quot; or force and it has a similar measure. Though these can be described with a number of other comparative variables as well - which we will not go into yet. [Think of volts, amps &amp; ohms and their relationship; as well as watts, coulombs &amp; joules]</p>
<h2 id="flow" tabindex="-1">Flow <a class="direct-link" href="#flow" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Note: The flow cannot be about enabling teams to become more productive, so that their masters can achieve more wealth and reap more benefits for themselves and those around them, to the detriment of the greater population. This flow has to be to achieve better relationship with this background upon which we dance. It is like not listening to the music, when dancing a duet.</p>
<p>[Somewhere there was a period where that was being expressed to the general benefit of the general population. And we were prepared to pay the price to achieve that material success and relative ease. Now the success of those ventures, is threatening our very existence. Probably because we are not willing to pay the price to maintain these benefits.]</p>
<h2 id="freedom" tabindex="-1">Freedom <a class="direct-link" href="#freedom" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Freedom from... what?</p>
<ul>
<li>Freedom from oppression</li>
<li>Freedom from bondage</li>
<li>Freedom from tyrants</li>
<li>Freedom from liars</li>
<li>Freedom from psychopathic leadership</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom for... what?<br>
Most of the time, we want freedom to do, or explore, the things we are not allowed or permitted to explore. The great adventure is escaping from your confinement and venturing out into the wilderness to experience something greater.<br>
And there are those of us who are terrified of what lurks in the darkness beyond which we can see.<br>
A balance between both is what we seek.</p>
<p>Again, I ask, Freedom for... what?<br>
Often we escape from one bondage, only to find ourselves caged in another. Can we ever escape that bondage, even if it is only to our own petty or grandiose desires?</p>
<ul>
<li>Egotism: The lowest form of freedom, is freedom to do what I want. To have what I want. Completely ego driven is very attractive to many who doubt their own worth, but is in the end so lonely, that it drives many to madness or to suicide. For, if successful, their whole existence will eventually consist only of reflections of their own egos - nothing else will be able to live in their space, and its surrounds. If unsuccessful, they will be absorbed into their own fantasies, and could sink into some deep dark place, from which any weird energy could explode.</li>
<li>Altruism: The next, normal humane level is that of service to an-other, or in a more developed form, others. Pure altruism, to dedicate oneself totally to the needs of other, is noble, but can be draining on the soul. There must be something left for yourself, otherwise you will dissolve in the ocean of needy. Take care, that it does not become a need, and thus essentially ego-feeding, instead of ego-reducing.</li>
<li>Seers: The we have the madmen and women who are driven by some vision that they see, or hear, or feel. They are a mixture of pure egotist, and yet often they are not driven by the gains of what they seek.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="light-and-dark" tabindex="-1">Light &amp; Dark <a class="direct-link" href="#light-and-dark" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot lesson the dark by focusing on it. Focusing on it is feeding it. We can only reduce the dark by increasing the light</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We cannot solve the problem by dwelling on it. Eventually it (the darkness) will swallow us.<br>
Only by living in the light can you overcome the darkness - though we are never free of it. For darkness is formed by light. &quot;He formed the light, and created the darkness.&quot; One can only create form in light with darkness!</p>
<p>Similarly, if we obsess over death - if <a href="atheist.html">we are in terror of it</a></p>
<h2 id="new-energy" tabindex="-1">New energy <a class="direct-link" href="#new-energy" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>What is the energy/energies of the future?</p>
<h2 id="objectification" tabindex="-1">Objectification <a class="direct-link" href="#objectification" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;objectification&quot; of living beings. and in fact, &quot;non-living&quot; objects as well - this producing the concept of:</p>
<h3 id="private-property" tabindex="-1">Private property <a class="direct-link" href="#private-property" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>which is just an overlay, an <a href="privacy_illusion.html">illusion</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sustainable" tabindex="-1">Sustainable <a class="direct-link" href="#sustainable" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>As in communities that self-sufficient, and are able to robust and dynamic</p>
<ul>
<li>What does sustainable really mean?</li>
<li>Is it a viable concept?</li>
<li>Is perhaps a better paradigm that of <a href="codependent.html">mutually beneficial co-dependence (MBCo)</a>?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="systems" tabindex="-1">Systems <a class="direct-link" href="#systems" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="complex-systems" tabindex="-1">Complex Systems <a class="direct-link" href="#complex-systems" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>[Reproduction:]Takes a certain amount of iterations (generally, at least, 4) in order for the &quot;complexity&quot; (actually regularity) to appear. [Regulating:] At which point it becomes &quot;self-regulating/governing&quot;. It manifests order/pattern - but the pattern is unpredictable.</p>
<h2 id="waves" tabindex="-1">Waves <a class="direct-link" href="#waves" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Any wave can be represented in any wave form.</p>
