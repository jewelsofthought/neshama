      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>Asking a Rabbi for help.</p>
    <div class="main-content">
      <p>Dear Rav Green,</p>
<p>I do not know if you remember me, but I have attended a number of services and other events at the Constantia Shul, often accompanied by Steve Jacobs. I have been living in the Eastern Cape, in the beautiful Amatola Mountains for the past 6 years. We used to have a functioning community in East London, but about 2 years ago they had a serious conflict with the Rabbi, and since then, the community has, may I be so bold as to say, been mal-functioning.</p>
<p>What I am reaching out to you regarding, is that I have been trying to collect my writings over the years, and many of them pertain to thoughts I have had (and continue to have), some of which are quite eclectic. As a result of which I have no idea if they are true (on target) or not - and that is what I need guidance with. I have to confess that I have been a student of Kabbalah for many years, and have studied with a number of different teachers, especially while I was in the States. My last teacher was Rabbi Seltzer, here in SA.</p>
<p>The other thing that I need help with is that as I have been on my own for so long, fairly isolated (especially since lockdown) in the small hamlet of Hogsback that we live in that my practice has been waning. After completing my schooling in SA, I made Aliyah, and spent the next 13 years in Israel before ending up in the States. I loved being in Israel because I felt that the Judaism I had spent all my life up to that point wrestling with finally made sense. In Israel it was a lived experience, whereas often I have felt as if it was an overlay - even if an excellent one. You must remember that there is much confusion for a young South African Jew as the seasons of the festivals are all wrong. it is not an easy thing to reconcile, so it inspires some deep questioning of the universality of some of the embedded constructs. It might have inspired me to spend a large part of my life trying to translate the depths that I could swim in to the modern vernacular. The Source that anything speaks of is unchanging. It is only us that can change, and with that change must come different words, or new ways to hear old words. And anything that does not, or will not, change - except for the Unchanging - is dead.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my request is to ask for any advice or guidance you may be able to give me. What I feel I need is a mentor of some nature, and someone with whom I can speak with who can guide me at this stage of my journey.</p>
<p>I hope this will not be seen as a strange request, but you are the only Rabbi that I feel I could reach out and ask at this point. If there is someone else who you can suggest who might be more able to help me, I would be very happy to go in the direction that you point me.</p>
