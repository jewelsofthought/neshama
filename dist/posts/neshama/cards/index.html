<p>A third approach sees the suffering associated with sin as the by-product of G-d's rehabilitation of the iniquitous soul. The analogy is the removal of an infective splinter from a person's body: the pain that is experienced is not a &quot;punishment&quot; as such for the person's carelessness, but an inevitable part of the healing process itself. The fact that a foreign body has become embedded in living flesh and has caused its decay makes its removal a painful experience. By the same token, when something alien to the soul's bond with G-d has become embedded within it, the extraction of this alien body, and the healing of the bond, is experienced as painful to both body and soul.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Energy that does not have form cannot be represented in this world. It can only be recognised through its interaction with some other &quot;form&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is only mathematics that is able to represent or describe this energies that do not have a manifest form like gravity or electricity. However, in the latter case there seems to be a form or order inherent in the energy&amp;mdsh;a form which is itself only probable—which we can conveniently refer to as packets, or, as the wont is nowadays, quanta. Thus we intrinsically believe that there will be a similar form for Gravity. Though what if there is not? For all of this has been created not just for God's or our pleasure, but for our learning. Somehow, we were lost, or, as we refer to it biblically, fallen. Perhaps we are errant souls or expressions of some desire for self identity existing in the plurema. However that may be, we are here and dream always of the world to come in which the evil that roams the world will have been banished or demolished. And perhaps gravity will be a koan to lead science deeper into the mystery of creation.</p>
<p>The only way we are made to be aware of this subtler energy is through its effect.</p>
<p>The quantum arena speaks of such energy. We feel it's effect in our everyday lives with our cell phones and other wireless devices. Yet there is an even more subtle energy, and it's one that vivifies everything, and we call it life when we see it move, and inanimate when it doesn't. Yet they all react to input and energy affects their structure and sometimes their behaviour too. So, they are in some sense alive.</p>
<p>Focusing on a more personal experience of life, I would like to ruminate a moment on sleep, in the context we have been discussing previously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When a person climbs into bed, his soul leaves him... (<em>Tishby Wisdom of the Zohar</em>, 1:121b, note 8, p203)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This soul fills the body, and when a person sleeps she ascends, drawing down life from above' - R' Me'ir (<em>Tishby Wisdom of the Zohar</em>, 2:809-12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of human sin, <em>Shekhinah</em> is enslaved to Lilith, the demonic feminine, channelling the flow of emanation to the demonic.</p>
<p>The abundance of the earth is in all. All designates Yesod, who transmits the entire flow of emanation to <em>Shekhinah</em>, symbolised by the earth—and through Her to the worlds below. So it is with the energy of life.</p>

<h2 id="dawn" tabindex="-1">Dawn <a class="direct-link" href="#dawn" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Awaking at dawn for no reason, l realize why we wake just before dawn to say the morning prayers. It is the time when the light first enters the darkness and parallels the creation which contains the mystery of the light and darkness, speaking of the darkness as that which existed before creation, and the light as the expression of the vitality of the Presence. This principle is of the highest order, in that the Presence does not move, or express itself in any form or fashion that we might be capable of comprehending. Only a quality, or appellation of Its presence could we ever comprehend, or indeed, even experience.</p>
<p>As the light gathers, and slowly, majestically, elegantly and gracefully begins to penetrate the darkness of the night, garbed and adorned in all her joy, twinkling and flirtatious, as the day could never be, so did the Will of G!d, b'h, gather to manifest the creation. In the same manner we gather our intention, our will prior to manifesting in this realm. It is like the seed about to burst, the egg on the verge of cracking. And the thoughts you are thinking will affect the waters of your day.</p>
<p>If what you thought could manifest in your day, and this is decided by the wisdom of the lord, which is far greater than any could apprehend, it will. If not then it gathers in the pool of its manifestation. When this pool gets full, it will overflow and begin to travel down the tree of manifestation, until, unless prevented by the guardians of the heavens, it will begin to express itself in this world.</p>
<p>Is it the same with your emotions? One student asked. And what about your actions? Another might query.</p>
<p>Well, that is why we come to the place of the dawn prayer, which preferably must begin before it is light, just as it begins to gather, say 10 or 15 minutes before dawn. The prayer speaks of G!d's greatness. It extols His glory. And prays that we be spared from the influence of the lamp of darkness, that we not be overcome by the evil tongue and that our enemies of spirit be kept far away. It calls to us to focus on the Divine Presence. Firstly in us, and in our environment, and prepare us for its unveiling through the magnificence of the emerging light.</p>
<p>But here, through the prayer and our gathering focus on the Divine light, we empty our emotional waters, allowing the peace of His presence to bathe and cleanse them. Our actions are similarly simple and direct. We invoke the morning gratitude and wash our hands, and pray. We cleanse our space and place our prayer shawl on our head and shoulders to &quot;shield us under thy mighty wings&quot;. Now we are ready for the binding. We have bowed to Your Will, and invoke your mercy and protection and accept the yoke of your teaching and once again swear to abide by your commandments, for you are our salvation - and as we swear our oath we bind our forearm , and place portions of the scroll to cover our third eye, with the laying of the specially prepared leather tefillin --as they are called.</p>
<p>The day has dawned, and having seeded it in this manner, the light that first enters, the prime order night</p>
<p>He occupied, or possessed, רכש, the middle. In order to create the middle required some emanation, thus it says he &quot; emanated the emanations&quot;. But it was from the middle that that was done.</p>

<p>Here is a brief glimpse of a description of the dynamics of the spiritual realm as seen and shared by our Rabbi's. Remember that this is an attempt to explain it, taking from the Hebrew and translating it into another language, another way of expressing this entanglement between the spiritual and the material realm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the basis of the tradition all of these attributes [of G!d] in the six extremities are also called “garden” [<em>gan</em>], as it says, “The Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east” (Gen 2:8), that is to say, from before [<em>mi-qedem</em>]<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> the creation of the world . . . and, in truth, Eden refers to <em>Hokhmah</em>, [Wisdom - one of the ten emanations], the inception of all the emanations [<em>ro’sh le-khol ha-sefirot</em>], which is intimated in the word <em>bere’shit</em> (ibid., 1:1), and the <em>Targum Yerushalmi</em> translates it as <em>be-hokhmata</em> [“by means of wisdom”], and the rabbis, blessed be their memory, said,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> “even the word <em>bere’shit</em> is a saying” [in the tally of the ten sayings by means of which the world was created]. Hence, Eden is the inner Wisdom [<em>ha-hokhmah ha-penimit</em>] in which are engraved the thirty-two paths of wisdom, and it is like a spring and like the root for all of them and for the garden. And the garden is like a tree that has many branches, from its head to its foundation, and it is nourished constantly from the root, which is the spring that comes forth from <em>Ein Sof</em>, and it spreads forth from the source without separation and without cessation, without day or hour, even a second, and this is the intent of what is written “the river goes forth from Eden to irrigate the garden” (Gen 2:10). River [<em>nahar</em>] is from <em>Nehora</em>, and this is the inner light [<em>ha-or ha-penimi</em>] that issues constantly from Eden. Therefore it says “goes forth” [<em>yotse</em>] and it did not say “went forth” [<em>yatsa</em>] for it does not cease, and in every moment it emanates in these attributes [<em>we-khol et hu mitpashet ba-middot</em>].<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
