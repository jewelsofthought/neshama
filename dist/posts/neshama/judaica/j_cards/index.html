<p>Temple: House of G-d; place of meeting with G-d -&gt; visionary world of the Divine; angelic space.</p>
<p>Place of meeting between G-d &amp; man: In a sense, the temple should then be called, &quot;The Temple of Meeting&quot;, just as the Tent was referred to in the Desert. {Or does this become part of the &quot;Only Moses can meet directly with G-d?&quot; line?</p>
<h2 id="humble" tabindex="-1">Humble <a class="direct-link" href="#humble" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Underneath does not necessarily mean lower. To acknowledge that you are below (be low = humble). Which means that you acknowledge that you are below (or under-neath) some One. Thus you have the &quot;lower realm&quot;, which is not really &quot;lower&quot;, but rather &quot;further&quot;. 'Further from what', you may ask. Further from the Truth (or Light of the Truth, or the True Light). To acknowledge myself as humble (לְהִתַחת)</p>

<p>In Hebrew, <em>Hashem</em> is not even the second word. In fact, it is the third and the sentence is rendered sometime like: &quot;It will be seen/appeared to...&quot; I emphasise this, because the first step is one of looking, then seeing. In order for it to appear, one must have looked at it, and the in order to &quot;see&quot; it, something (hopefully what you were looking for) must have been &quot;found&quot;... and that requires a stillness, and ability to receive.</p>

<p><em>And you I shall scatter amongst the nations</em> (26:33)</p>
<p>G-d did a kindness to the people of Israel, that he scattered them amongst the nations. For if they were concentrated in one place, the heathens would make war on them; but since they are dispersed, they cannot be destroyed.<br>
-- (<em>Talmud Pesachim 87b; Midrash Lekach Tov</em>)</p>
<p>The people of Israel were exiled among the nations only in order that converts should be added to them. (<em>Talmud, ibid.</em>)</p>

<p><em>If you will not hearken to Me, and walk casually with Me; I, too, will act casually with you...</em> (26:28)</p>
<p>All sins derive from the sin of insignificance: when a person ceases to be sensitive to the paramount importance which G-d attaches to his life and deeds. &quot;I<br>
don't really matter&quot; is not humility—it is the ultimate arrogance. It really means: &quot;I can do what I want&quot;. The most terrible of punishments is for G-<br>
d to indulge the sinner this vanity. For G-d to say: &quot;All right, have it your way; what happens to you is of no significance&quot;; for G-d to act toward him as if He really does not care what happens to him. (<em>The Chassidic Master</em>)</p>
<p>This point is illustrated by a story told by the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wealthy businessman and his coachman arrived in a city one Friday afternoon. After the rich man was settled at the best hotel in town, the coachman went off to his humble lodgings. Both washed and dressed for Shabbat and then set out for the synagogue for the evening prayers. On his way to shul, the businessman came across a wagon which had swerved off the road and was stuck in the ditch. Rushing to help a fellow in need, he climbed down into the ditch and began pushing and pulling at the wagon together with its hapless driver. But for all his good intentions, the businessman was hopelessly out of his depth. After struggling for an hour in the knee-deep mud, he succeeded only in ruining his best suit of Shabbat clothes and getting the wagon even more hopelessly embedded in the mud. Finally, he dragged his bruised and aching body to the synagogue, arriving a scant minute before the start of Shabbat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the coachman arrived early to the synagogue and sat down to recite a few chapters of Psalms. At the synagogue he found a group of wandering paupers, and being blessed with a most generous nature, invited them all to share his meal. When the synagogue sexton approached the paupers to arrange meal placements the town's householders, as is customary in Jewish communities, he received the same reply from them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thank you, but I have already been invited for the Shabbat meal.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the coachman's means were unequal to his generous heart, and his dozen guests left his table with but a shadow of a meal in their hungry stomachs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus the coachman, with his twenty years of experience in extracting wagons from mudholes, took it upon himself to feed a small army, while the wealthy businessman, whose Shabbat meal leftovers could easily have fed every hungry man within a ten mile radius, floundered about in a ditch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Every soul,&quot; said Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak in conclusion, &quot;is entrusted with a mission unique to her alone, and is granted the specific aptitudes, talents and resources necessary to excel in her ordained role. One most take care not to become one of those 'lost souls' who wander through life trying their hand at every field of endeavour except for what is truly and inherently their own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Every person was born to a mission in life that is distinctly, uniquely and exclusively their own. No one—not even the greatest of souls—can take his or her place. No person who ever lived or who ever will live can fulfil that particular aspect of G-d's purpose in creation in his stead. (<em>The Lubavitcher Rebbe</em>)</p>

<h2 id="chok-statutedecree" tabindex="-1">Chok - Statute/Decree <a class="direct-link" href="#chok-statutedecree" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p><em>If you walk in My statutes</em> (Leviticus 26:3)</p>
<p>The word <em>chok</em> (&quot;statute&quot; or &quot;decree&quot;), which gives the <em>Parshah of Bechukotai</em> its name, literally means &quot;engraved&quot;. The Torah comes in two forms: written and engraved. On the last day of his life, Moses inscribed the Torah on parchment scrolls. But this written Torah was preceded by an engraved Torah: the Divine law was first given to us encapsulated in the Ten Commandments, which were etched by the hand of G-d in two tablets of stone. When something is written, the substance of the letters that express it—the ink—remains a separate entity from the substance upon which they have been set—the parchment. On the other hand, letters engraved in stone are forged in it: the words are stone and the stone is words. By the same token, there is an aspect of Torah that is &quot;inked&quot; on our soul: we understand it, our emotions are roused by it; it becomes our &quot;lifestyle&quot; or even our &quot;personality&quot;; but it remains something additional to ourselves. But there is a dimension of Torah that is <em>chok</em>, engraved in our being. There is a dimension of Torah which expresses a bond with G-d that is of the very essence of the Jewish soul. (<em>Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi</em>)</p>
<p>A rabbi once offered the following analogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Every Jew is a letter in the Torah. But a letter may, at times, grow somewhat faded. It is our sacred duty to mend these faded letters and make G-d's Torah whole again.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="galut-(exile)" tabindex="-1">Galut (Exile) <a class="direct-link" href="#galut-(exile)" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>In <em>galut</em> (&quot;exile&quot;) the Jewish conscience lies dormant, the soul unable to express and actualize its G‑dly awareness and feelings. The cure to this state of spiritual coma is the Jew's selfless submission of the role he must play in the Divine plan--a role that transcends emotion and intellect. It is this simple loyalty to G‑d that restores the Jew's essential relationship with Him.</p>
<p>Though Mordechai was a Benjaminite, he is called <em>Yehudi</em> (&quot;Jew&quot;) which literally means a descendant of the tribe of <em>Yehudah</em> (Judah). Likewise, throughout the <em>Megillah</em>, the entire Jewish people are called <em>Yehudim</em>, without distinction of tribal origin. For <em>Yehudi</em> is of the same root as <em>hoda'ah</em> which means &quot;to acknowledge&quot; and &quot;to accept&quot;. This title describes the core of the Jew, his untouchable essence.</p>
