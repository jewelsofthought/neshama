<blockquote>
<p>י + ה =&gt; ח =&gt; חי<br>
Between the <em>Yud</em> and the <em>Chet</em> of the <em>Chai</em> is our perception</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Beriah</em>, <em>Yetzirah</em>, <em>Assiyah</em> = Thought, Speech, Deed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thought = internal; unified with thinker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speech = intermittent; directed outward to another; 'limitation of thought/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action = further away (from the &quot;soul&quot;, the source of the experience); deeds exist independently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Angels : Comprehend Divine; bounded, ordained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man: Greater potential (for Good/Evil); Given choice - the blessing and the curse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yud</em>: - represents 10; completeness. Doubled, it is one of the appelation of G-d.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Heh</em>:<br>
3 lines, with <em>Yud</em> as potential<br>
one leg, the left, leg is the <em>Vav</em>, which has <em>Yud</em> at the top.<br>
it is unattached, missing the &quot;connection&quot;, a piece (the <em>Yud</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Vav</em>: Has <em>Yud</em> on top, ascent to אין סוף</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Het</em>:<br>
was Yud, enclosed, representing 3d.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[NOTE: the image is of the <em>Yud</em>, the essential essence, manifesting. Then as the it grew legs and a head, and became the <em>Chet</em>. But, upon the <em>Yud</em> manifesting, there was a space of not-<em>Yud</em>, that had to be as well. So the <em>heh</em> has the not-<em>Yud</em>, while the <em>yud</em>, has hidden in the <em>Chet</em>. Now, when I refer to a space of not-<em>Yud</em>, it is the complimentary opposite, which is also known as a portal. By engaging/entangling (entering the space of) the not-<em>yud</em>, you can &quot;track/trace&quot; the <em>Yud</em>. You could say you enter through the not-<em>Yud</em>, and exit through the <em>Yud</em>, which is the same place. The mystery here is that only by contemplating the space of the not-<em>yud</em>, you can find the <em>Yud</em>, which is right there all the time. The mystery continues, because it is not the <em>Chet</em>, which is the representation of this, but the <em>Heh</em>, which is &quot;missing&quot; the <em>Yud</em>. But the real <em>Yud</em>, the one we are referring to here, is &quot;hidden&quot;, or cannot be seen with our eyes, so it appears as an invisible <em>Yud</em>, one that only those with the right eyes can see, and know that it is the portal to the <em>Yud</em> realm - but has to be approached from the non-<em>Yud</em> space. (Am i mad?) ]<br>
difference between <em>Chet</em> and <em>Bet</em> is the <em>bet</em> is open to the future, while <em>chet</em> is only open below. Thus, the mystery of the <em>Chet</em> is not to &quot;fall&quot; down, but to rise up to the ceiling, and open the <em>Yud</em> portal at the top (left/feminine).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus Vav could also be looked at as an ascent (or portal)</p>

<li>Faith: Single commandment = descent along the <em>Vav</em></li>
<li>All 613 happen right now for each and every one of us</li>
<li>All we need is faith + His 613 commandments to create the vessel/chariot/<em>merkaba</em></li>
<li><em>Merkaba</em>: metatron - the &quot;root&quot; particle design from the spiritual world. It is the template from which all 'tron's are fashioned - proton, electron, neutron, positron, etc.</li>
<li>Metatron = <em>Merkaba</em> of <em>Malchut</em> in the world of <em>Assiya</em></li>
<li>&quot;Shall live&quot; = resurrection of the dead!</li>
<li>Public domain: Kabbalah, Angelic Realm, QP</li>
<li>Private domain: faith (Spiritual)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intelligent-design" tabindex="-1">Intelligent design <a class="direct-link" href="#intelligent-design" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Argument for intelligent design is the fact of a result not being the optimum one. If counter with &quot;perhaps in some greater framework...&quot;... then this greater framework much possess greater intelligence to.</p>
<p>The Word of G-d is Speech -the thought made given voice, made manifest -<br>
which is the process of <em>Tzimtzum</em>. Which is the descent and flow of the Light, or life force, from the upper planes to the lower by a series of contractions. This density continues to occur until it reaches a density that is sufficient for manifest life to appear.</p>
<p>Yet there seems to be a critical threshold beyond which it begins to affect the life<br>
negatively, and enters into a realm which we call <em>Sitra Ahara</em>, the Other. This &quot;threshold&quot; could be identified by the &quot;Light becoming Dark&quot;, which means that it is less. And that would make sense - as the Light travels further and further from the source, it will get less. This densification of the Light is called <em>kelipot</em>.</p>
<p>Now, we have a problem, if this Light was the Light of the Creator, it would fill everything, and so how could there be Darkness? Well, in the beginning the Light was supernal, which means it was pure and simple - no darkness, no shadows. Then He &quot;split&quot; the Light, made them essentially male and female - light and dark. This is the fundamental beginning of Creation. It does not begin with Aleph, but with Bet. There can be no story, no drama, no dance, unless there are you have someone to tell the story, or play out the drama with and we spend much of our life seeking that dance partner.</p>
<p>We receive light from the Divine Word and Breath (&quot;breathed into his nostrils&quot;), concealed from us, by the Divine Will, and the densification which is our birthright.<br>
This densification is an expression of the downward thrust of the <em>Tzimtzum</em> towards the centre - which is where Adonai sits.</p>
