<blockquote>
<p>Consciousness is a fundamental process/property of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One could think of consciousness as self-aware energy, and self-aware energy is energy that is aware of the information it is receiving and transmitting - to a lessor or greater degree.</p>
<p>I like to express it in terms of <a href="dimensions.html">dimensions</a>.</p>
<p>The above idea might open one to the theories of <em>panpsychism</em>, which says that even a rock has consciousness. It exists as a rock, with all the characteristics of rock, but is it self-aware?</p>
<p>However, there is a theory, a cosmology, wrapped in a practice and the living expression of an ancient tradition, in which consciousness IS the fundamental property of the universe, called <a href="kabbalah_intro.html">kabbalah</a>.</p>
<h2 id="waves" tabindex="-1">Waves <a class="direct-link" href="#waves" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Energy as basic material</li>
<li>Expressed as waves</li>
<li>Exists everywhere/anywhere at once</li>
<li>No time or spacial constraints
<ul>
<li>as we understand it from our time/space bound 3d perspective,</li>
<li>though their might be a different time/space boundaries in other realities/dimensions</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="release" tabindex="-1">Release <a class="direct-link" href="#release" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Just before energy release, there is the greatest pressure. That is due to the fact that it has to reach critical mass/density/energy in order to have enough force to expand or replicate - which is an organic way to expand.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-principle-of-evil" tabindex="-1">Dynamic principle of Evil <a class="direct-link" href="#dynamic-principle-of-evil" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>One of the most effective tools of the <em>Sitra Ahara</em>, the &quot;Other Side&quot;, Satan, is to keep us bus with the mundane aspects of our lives, thus leaving no space for the Divine. All relationships need attention to flourish. If there is no time for a relationship with the Father, than eventually the two of you will become somewhat estranged and unfamiliar.</p>
<h2 id="form" tabindex="-1">Form <a class="direct-link" href="#form" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Form</strong>:<br>
Contraction: Energy at rest. Meaning that it has reached some state of local dynamic balance.<br>
Think of it this way.
<ul>
<li>energy &quot;at rest&quot; can be <a href="#measurement">measured</a></li>
<li></li>
<li>particle: &quot;slow&quot; enough to be measured</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Force</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="force" tabindex="-1">Force <a class="direct-link" href="#force" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>energy in (linear) movement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measurement" tabindex="-1">Measurement <a class="direct-link" href="#measurement" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>We have two types of measuring instruments.</p>
<h3 id="real" tabindex="-1">Real <a class="direct-link" href="#real" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>which measures real things, with real measuring tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in order be able to measure, need a measuring tool (let's call it a ruler)<br>
this tool has to be crafted to a certain agreed standards of measurement (cm, in, etc).<br>
in this case, measurement is a kind of standard that everyone has agreed to, so that it can be &quot;traded&quot; quantitatively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="virtual" tabindex="-1">Virtual <a class="direct-link" href="#virtual" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>which measures measured things with complex data collection tools, that then require sophisticated mathematics to solve.</li>
<li>Now, we have another virtual (one could almost say esoteric) field of measurement, which is far more intricate and complex than that of our normal empirical way of measuring that we are used to. It requires us to construct complex measuring devices (they have may names: Particle accelerator, etc), and even more complex mathematics to &quot;measure&quot; them. The problem here is not the agreement of standards - which we already have from our empirical measuring instruments - like weight, length, speed, etc. It is more that we are not sure what we are measuring - or if our methods of calculation are valid - but they work!</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me give you a simple example. If I know that the answer to the problem is 13. Everyone ponders possible solutions to the problem. The along comes Prof. Dumbledee, and proves that 1 + 5 + 7 = 13. Everyone is ecstatic, and he is greatly honoured for that insight. Even more honour is heaped upon me when I show that it can predict outcomes. In other words, if I have it and find another 5 of them. Then gathering another 7, I show that I then have a 13! Everybody is celebrating this giant leap forward.</p>
<p>Then along come Prof. Doodledee and shows that if I take just 4 of them, and then put another 9 into the equation, I also get 13. What a disruption this causes. Does that mean that it is different? Do we have two 13's then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what happens when we get confused between the virtual and the real.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="human-measurement" tabindex="-1">Human measurement <a class="direct-link" href="#human-measurement" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>In the same way, we have two types of experiences:</p>
<h3 id="real:-form" tabindex="-1">Real: Form <a class="direct-link" href="#real:-form" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>can be measured</li>
<li>can be uniquely identified (time/space)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="imaginary:-wave" tabindex="-1">Imaginary: Wave <a class="direct-link" href="#imaginary:-wave" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A wave is an imaginary mapping of the sensation that you feel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A sensation can only be measured/experienced when it causes an observable (measurable) change in some recognisable (measurable) characteristic of an identified (measurable) object. This is <a href="entanglement.html">entanglement</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the more subtle the wave/sensation, the more sensitive a measuring instrument is needed.</p>
<p>When a wave becomes <strong>entangled</strong> (either with enough other waves) or a &quot;standing wave&quot; or particle/object, then it is recognised as a particle. And we call it &quot;the collapse of the wave (function)&quot;. Thus a wave can only be &quot;experienced/measured&quot; when it interacts with something, and causes some change in the state of the &quot;observer&quot; (or object of or under investigation).</p>
