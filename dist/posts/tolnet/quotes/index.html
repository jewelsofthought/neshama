<pre><code>      An invitation to participate
      in forming a self-organizing, self-governing global community
      dedicated to developing, disseminating and implementing
      new concepts of organization
      that result in more equitable sharing of power and wealth,
      improved health, and greater compatibility
      with the human spirit and biosphere.

<p>“The underlying philosophy of non-violence is that the people have more power than their government, but must connect with each other in order to mobilize that power.”<br>

<h2 id="the-net-of-indra" tabindex="-1">The Net of Indra <a class="direct-link" href="#the-net-of-indra" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The Net of Indra is a profound and subtle metaphor for the structure of reality. Imagine a vast net; at each crossing point there is a jewel; each jewel is perfectly clear and reflects all the other jewels in the net, the way two mirrors placed opposite each other will reflect an image ad infinitum. The jewels in this metaphor stand for an individual being, or an individual consciousness, or a cell, or an atom, or a crystal. Every jewel is intimately connected with all other jewels in the universe, and a change in one jewel means a change, however slight, in every other jewel.</p>

<li>Stephen Mitchell, The Enlightened Mind.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the Jewel of Indra, the network as I envisage it. I believe that by creating and activating the structure, the most amazing things will happen. Once someone who believed they were disempowered suddenly becomes empowered, the energy that will be released will be so incredible we need just step back and let it do its work.</p>

<h2 id="network" tabindex="-1">Network <a class="direct-link" href="#network" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<pre><code>    Decide to network
    Use every letter you write
    Every conversation you have
    Every meeting you attend
    To express your fundamental beliefs and dreams
    Affirm to others the vision of the world you want
    Network through thought
    Network through action
    Network through love
    Network through the spirit
    You are the center of the world
    You are a free, immensely powerful source
    of life and goodness
    Affirm it
    Spread it
    Radiate it
    Think day and night about it
    And you will see a miracle happen:
    the greatness of your own life.
    In a world of big powers, media, and monopolies
    But of six billion individuals
    Networking is the new freedom
    the new democracy
    a new form of happiness.

<p>After reading a through his ideas, there are some that are excellent. His ability to think in global terms, analysing many of the large scale issues that need to be dealt with, is commendable. To that end, it was be beneficial to us all if these ideas were to be implemented. However I question his uncompromising support for a form of World Government based upon the current political and economic framework. The Government could turn out to be even more distant from the average person, the citizens. It could become another form of the present government, only perhaps larger and more bureaucratic and politicized, and even more unaccountable. How tedious the process of change or agreement or action would be? How distant, how unaccountable would that body be in the end, to the average person. And once set in motion, how incredibly difficult it would be to change any direction.</p>
<p>The other point is that in order to have a world government we would need a global community that required and participated and supported and interfaced with it. This is essentially the concept of the Tree of Life Network. This is a vision of a manner to weave a more dynamic, better connected and more responsive global community that will form the foundation of this World Government.</p>
