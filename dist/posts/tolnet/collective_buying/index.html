<p>For many years, ever since I was a young man, I could not understand why there was such a paucity of collectives that organised around the needs of local groups. I suppose, my current hypothesis, is that this is a threat to the dominance of the the elements of centralised power, which are seldom, if ever, about the needs of the people, but more concerned with maintained the status quo.</p>
<p>Is that not essentially what a corporation is? And is not a coorporation allowed complete self-rule - in other words, it can decide how to run itself. It could structured upon socialist or equal rights, perhaps a sharing internal economy, with autonomy and empowerement encourage at all levels. People refer to a Kibbutz structure as a socialist one, but could not a corporation be a socialist organisation?</p>
