	<h3>Description:</h3>
	<p>Like a mandala made of sand, we build our lives, only for it to be washed away in the ocean of time.</p>

<h2 id="sand-mandala" tabindex="-1">Sand Mandala <a class="direct-link" href="#sand-mandala" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Like a sand mandala, every day I build a day of action and being, like a mandala of sand. Each night, when I sleep it is erased, and the next day, I begin to build anew.<br>
“But things remain after I go to sleep that are still there the next day. Like the house I live in, my family, friends, my work, etc.”<br>
Yes, those are the symbols that reappear in many mandalas, though they might reappear in different places, similarly, your house might be in a different place in your life to mine. These symbols are representations of things that exist, but perhaps in another realm, or from another realm, but do reappear in our lives time and again. Just as these mandalas with their symbols tell a story, you, with your house and family, have a history.<br>
Imagine the mandala of your emotions then. Each day you awaken, you will produce a different mandala of emotions – even though those emotions might only come from a limited set of “symbols” – which we could term feelings or colours, as we often use colours to represent certain emotions. It is like looking at sad music as a symbol of sadness.<br>
Finally, what about your thoughts? Each day are you thinking the same thoughts? Then, I’m afraid, you might be caught in a loop, a kind of ground hog day – even if they are lovely. This kaleidescope of flashing thoughts, many of which flit by before you can even register them, changes from day to day too – even from moment to moment. And our mental realm is full of its archetypes too.</p>
