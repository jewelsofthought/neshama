<p>Money could be thought of as virtual token by which complex multi-layered transactions can take place over long-distances and long times. It should not be just a store of value. The value should be intrinsic to the article itself – and its actual cost to produce.</p>
<p>That is possibly one of the core factors that are causing the economic system to malfunction – and that is that fact that the monetary value has little to do with its intrinsic value. Instead it expresses it value through a system that is severely flawed. In a large part due to the biases and controls that keep money flowing along specifically designed channels.</p>
<p>Taking into account the fact that a system can only produce a result that is as good as or less than the source that it is taken from. Thus if you have a flawed source, you will have a system at least as flawed. Perhaps the place to start in proposing economic systems is to base them upon a more complete description of the basic units of the system – us! It takes seven variable to completely (mathematically) describe a Turing computer (which is the “type” of computers we have). Surely we humans are more complex – but nevertheless this could be a fruitful area of exploration, using the same methods and thought process that caused the academics to agree to this description, to attempt to describe human behaviour. With an more accurate starting equation, it might be possible to design a system that express and supports human behaviour more effectively.</p>
