<p>By using 3d designs to build 4d structures, we are only perpetuating the 4d paradigm we are presently struggling with. We have to being to perceive our existence and what is happening and why from a 4d perspective, using the 3d structures, but not being constrained by its strictures.<br>
One could the 4d as movement in 3d. In fact, it is through this very movement/change of 3d objects, that have enabled us to discover and describe the 4d version of said 3d object. Only through some movement, some change of state in 3d, that we could not describe using our 3d mathematical tools, could we even become aware of the possibility of the existence of such a 4d entity, leading us to more accurate (4d) descriptions (of the 3d empirical experience of matter). We describe the 4d objects as a composite of what we know, 3d objects – just as 2d may form a composite of 3d forms.<br>
And just as 2d is highly effective in a 3d environment, it is limited and be predicted and controlled from a 3d perspective... so it is regarding one who has a 4d perspective on our 3d existence.<br>
Up till now, we have presented this 4d landscape in religious, mythological and sociological terms, emphasising the qualities of love, kindness, humility, gentleness, etc. Though it includes pride, greed, lust, desire, etc. too. One could describe this as the 4d aspect of human beings, an unpredictable indescribable experience that that can have huge effect on our lives. Even among the aspects of 4d that we do know or recognise, they all “suffer” from unpredicable, yet known, behaviour. That is, although we know how it behaves, we cannot say what it will do at any moment with any certainty, until it has already done it (made its choice – so as to say).</p>
<hr>
<p>We have managed to overcome much of what has threatened us in the past. I believe many of the ills that we suffer from now, at this point of human evolution, are caused by humans... us. // We are our own worst enemy. We say that on an individual basis, and, it seems, as regarding the present crises we are facing. \ We are supposed to be an intelligent species – and we are. But if this is the best we can do, then it seems that some beastly, self-destructive urge is what has driven us to this evolutionary point.<br>
My message it for us to enter the timeless zone of 4d prepared, because judging from what is unfolding, we are passing through into this amazing place, full of incredible surprises and amazing gifts. But let us not charge blindly into the space that angels fear to tread.</p>

<p>Shamans and mystics, those intrepid explorers of the other realms, have indeed encountered this space in the earliest of days. How they did, we do not know. But there are many records of such journeys and dealings with this realm from all over the world.<br>
In a time when the only language one could use to describe these realms was story and myth, we used archetypes and symbols that would awaken the unconscious mind, from mandalas to myth. However, we do have another language today to describe that space, although it is like the prince that will not take his place on the throne, denying all connection to his family – and that is the language of mathematics.<br>
Science suffers from all the ills of any living religion. From the fanatics to the liberals, and all the various levels of interpretations of its texts, often by those who do not understand the original language it was written in.<br>
So let us enter into the magical realm of 4d and work together to live in a future that is not decreed and driven by this 3d chaos, but embraces where life is leading us, and gather to ensure a future for being human.</p>
