      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>Is the wrong image</p>
    <div class="main-content">
      <h2 id="quote" tabindex="-1">Quote <a class="direct-link" href="#quote" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Any object of a higher dimensional can only be partially perceived by a lower dimensional object.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-miraculous" tabindex="-1">The miraculous <a class="direct-link" href="#the-miraculous" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Simple: God is the miraculous. God exists in and as the miraculous. The miraculous is G-d's way of speaking to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine a group of people witnessing something miraculous. Is it not that every eye-witness would have a different version of the story? It is like a regular map of the world that we see in atlases (or on the screen), which is a 2d version of a 3d event - the earth, and, as such, is not true.</p>
<p>And how to find words to express such an experience?</p>
<h2 id="god" tabindex="-1">God <a class="direct-link" href="#god" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>If I am unsure that there is a God, or if I will even exist after this life, then why not attain whatever I am able in this life, however I obtain it, and deal with what comes after, if anything, when it happens?<br>
This is a far more pragmatic and realistic approach than the &quot;spiritual&quot; or even &quot;tribal&quot;. If there is God, and He has sent me down here and this is what I am, to the best of my ability, capable of doing, then for what will he be punishing me? Is not my striving to achieve the best I can with what I have been given what I need to be doing?</p>
<p>Because, it seems, even the best of us have our &quot;dark&quot; corners... And that is what we are afraid of. If we become aware of that darkness, then we have allowed it into our lives, but, if we spend our whole lives fighting it, then how can we achieve the best that we can achieve in the limited time we have?</p>
<p>Unless one turns that around, and says that all one's actual task is, is to fight against the evil, that begins in your own mind!<br>
Which is essentially what all mystics and religions actually say. Anything else is socio-political, because this is the actually the most revolutionary act that one can take in the society. It is an act of sovereignty.</p>
<h2 id="finite-event" tabindex="-1">Finite event <a class="direct-link" href="#finite-event" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Even if the finite being was part of an infinite event, it could (by definition) only be a partial representation of that infinity. Each step down from a higher dimension, requires the &quot;removal&quot; of an infinity! Or more benignly, the reduction of an infinite aspect of that higher dimensional object to zero (0).</p>
<p>Conversely, for the lower dimensional object to perceive a higher dimensional object, it would need to embrace an extra aspect of the infinite. That, however, requires two prerequisites:</p>
<ol>
<li>That it has the desire to see this aspect.</li>
<li>That it has the capacity to perceive this extra &quot;dimension&quot;/infinity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Would not such an experience be expressed as &quot;miraculous&quot;?</p>
<h2 id="hurdle-of-language" tabindex="-1">Hurdle of Language <a class="direct-link" href="#hurdle-of-language" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This has the major hurdle of Language: how to express the inexpressible? In addition, it would be impossible for the finite to in any way encapsulate and experience of the infinite. For if there is a whole infinity that has not been explored, how can one express those things that have not even been perceived, let alone explored? How would one be able to express such a meeting?</p>
<p>Thus the depth of the journey can only be as deep as the symbols that one has to &quot;guide&quot; one on the journey, and, upon return, the icons that one finds/creates/adopts to express the ineffable experience. This is a selfless task, best expressed by the principle of there those are who have had this experience (esoteric) and those who have not (exoteric).</p>
<h2 id="cross" tabindex="-1">Cross <a class="direct-link" href="#cross" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Jesus on the Cross is the wrong image, it is, in essence, homo-erotic,<br>
though that is not the primary reason for its incorrectness</p>
<h2 id="home-erotic" tabindex="-1">Home-erotic <a class="direct-link" href="#home-erotic" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This it would be claimed, would be too erotic, and unsuitable for young minds, especially if she was half-naked, as would be expected. But not for the homosexually inclined. This could be a easily eroticised, just as erotic as a half-naked, young, lovely for women to a normal man<br>
However, if the female is to take her place beside the male in any discourse regarding the future of our society, and its norms of behaviour, she will have to be at least equal in any narrative on which this is built. Thus we have to change the narrative, and could call this decade 2020's, the New Narrative</p>
<p>It is filled with signs and portends: 2020 itself is indicative of a square (4), and 20x20. Square: 4 legs, 20x20, stable.</p>
<p>This new narrative has to begin with the question of why is the Messiah a man? Is it because God is a man? Is it because God is man's creation?</p>
<h2 id="female" tabindex="-1">Female <a class="direct-link" href="#female" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>However, the female ravaged, the female crucified, is a much better representation of what has been happening in the world, and what is still occurring. It is not that it is only happening to the women. We know it is happening to the elderly, the poor, the children, the sick, the mentally/emotionally ill, and the economically distressed. But the point is, the essence of it is, is that it is essentially male dominated - in that it is men who are mainly perpetuating it. [With a strange narcissistic edge to it, as evidenced by the continuous homoerotic elements throughout the ages.]</p>
<p>The Jesus narrative, with the symbol of a man hanging bleeding and tormented on the cross, is just a narcissistic image of deep male anguish - a reflection/perception/expression of this dark depth of a male's soul expression. Essentially it is male gazing on male and his male narrative, with the women kneeling weeping at his feet - props in his, the male's, grand narrative.</p>
<p>But to show the weak, the earth, the soft, the very womb and bosoms upon which we are all nurtured being torn and ravaged by these male sycophants would create a new narrative.</p>
<h2 id="power-fantasies" tabindex="-1">Power fantasies <a class="direct-link" href="#power-fantasies" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>It seems that the lower fantasies are far more tangible, and thus perhaps attainable - and that is the essence of their attraction</p>
<p>Power fantasies: -</p>
<ul>
<li>lower: rape, enslave, control</li>
<li>upper: control over oneself, balance in dealings with others,</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="good-and-evil" tabindex="-1">Good and evil <a class="direct-link" href="#good-and-evil" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The essential difference between good and evil - good gives us a choce, evil never does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we don't know how much of each there is, nor even how it is distributed in this world. We just know that it is, and it is everywhere!</p>
<p>In fact, the best we can do, is to build bubbles of space &amp; time that contain the good (and thus bubbles that also &quot;contain&quot; the evil).</p>
<p>Let's change perspective, and look at this representation as one that speaks of &quot;how evil, or how good?&quot;. And let's look at it this way:<br>
There will be at least one spot where truly and unadulterated evil can exist just as there is at least one spot where the true pure good can exist. And these two spots define the extent of the world of good and evil. They define the boundary of the domain of good &amp; evil. What exists beyond? Well, in the realm of the infinite infinities, or the infinitely infinite, or the infinity of infinites.... who knows?</p>
<p>Returning to the circle, this circle defines the place of the purest of good &amp; evil, and inside the circle are all the different gradations of good and evil - the benonim (inbetweeners). In essence, the whole narrative is about us, the Benonim, the &quot;average&quot;, the &quot;normal&quot; - for we make up the vast majority of human existence.</p>
<p>You could say that if someone is purely good, then there is nothing that needs to be done. They will live a completely sovereign existence according to their inner edicts, and nothing can shake them or divert them...</p>
<p>However, in the same way, if someone is truly evil, he is driven also by inner compulsion, and will influence all those around them, and those that he cannot influence - he will eliminate. And this is what makes him a potent force of evil.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, it is one of the reasons we say that God is good - because he gives us a choice of whether to follow the impulse to Good or that to Evil.</p>
<p>The burning question of existence then becomes, if God is the creator of the universe, and therefore omnipotent, was he not the one who created evil in the first place? Why,... God? Why? That is a difficult question, perhaps THE question, especially in the midst of this inner battle of the Benoni between good and evil.</p>
<p>And however you answer it will affect how you live your life, and much of the consequences thereof. Whether for/by yourself, or because of your belief in omeones else's answer.</p>
