<p>Do you realise what is happening? It is the time of Armageddon, when the baby will be torn from the arms of the screaming mother, and the child will not be able to be with his parent when the time comes for her to pass over; when congerations will no longer be able to meet and share in communial gatherings to pray to their gods and their ancestors.</p>
<p>It is strange that the story of the Exodus of the Jewish people from their bondage in Egypt starts off with the Pharoah's refusal to allow them to go into the wilderness to pray to their Gods. It is like a Christian not being given the day off for Xmas - oh, darn, I forgot, that already happens in the Christian countries themselves!</p>
<p>We will become the pariah's of society, the hated, and the feared. For we are not &quot;innoculated&quot; against the dreaded disease of non-compliance to the regime. What regime am I talking of here? It is the medical regime - science and health seem to be on a path to extermination. This medical health regime had become a cancer on the body social. It only knows it own needs and appetites - driven by our fear of death, and the need for control of our destiny (another death avoiding strategy). However, to avoid death is to avoid life. Death is an intrinsic aspect of life, and cannot be seperated. When your time comes... we say. And now this &quot;scientific revolution&quot; (against who is science rebelling? It seems, in the end, against G-d. Science believes [yes - believes, like the religious zealot believes] that we are here to improve on G-d's design, although it does not acknowledge the existence of G-d, claiming that there is no emperical proof of G-d. It is like the idiot looking at the elephant in the room, and asking &quot;What elephant&quot;. Is it so big that we cannot see it? Is it not so obvious that it does not, nay cannot be proven. Just as the question of whether the set of all sets is itself as set, the obvious reality in which we are born is a prededermined environment. It was here long before I was born, and will be here long after I am dead. So, It Itself is a &quot;something&quot;, even if just an existence. Though, if it has taken us, with our vaunted intelligence so many &quot;thousands&quot; of years to understand the little of what is going on around us that we do at present understand, whatever inhabits this universe, and designed it so explicitly, must &quot;know&quot; something we don't, something fundamental to this existence. And as such, is at the very least, a superior form of intelligence.)</p>
