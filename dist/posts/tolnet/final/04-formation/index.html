	<p>These are the basic cells/leaves where actual people connect.</p>

<p>As we build this network of connections, we group the members into cells, or affinity groups (af-groups), consisting of 10 people. This cell forms the basic unit of the Tree of Life, generally referred to as a leaf node or external node of the tree. All other nodes are called internal nodes, and their purpose is to support the leaf nodes. The people forming this cell must be geographically or physically close. If there are not sufficient people, they may be personally connected through some sort of physical (real, as opposed to virtual) connection. Their sponsor (referred to in point 2 of initial requirements, above) must be a member who personally knows them.<br>
This group will then meet at least once a week to discuss any relevant issues or needs. It is estimated that approximately two hours per week will be sufficient. If there is interest, or research regarding a proposal that you want to present, more time or energy can be offered.</p>
