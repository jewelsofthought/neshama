<pre><code>          If we continue to do things
          the same way,
          how can we expect a different result.

          By the strength of our common endeavours we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few. Where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe. And where we live together, freely, in a spirit of sharing, acceptance and honouring.”

<p>Humanity must adopt a new way of thinking in order to ameliorate the problems we currently face. We cannot re-arrange the present components to produce a solution, as ample examples from the past have shown. Revolutions, violent or not, seem to merely produce another version of that which previously existed. A deeper, more core shift, is necessary.</p>
<p>A system needs to emerge to deal with the dynamics of our global society that is closer to our vision of a unified world working in co-operation.</p>
<p>I propose a system that is a web of trust, composed of communities of affinity groups co-ordinated through a network: a local, distributed communications infrastructure with the goal of empowering the “leaves” – comprised of locally connected people – to solve and deal with their problems. It is organised as a tree-like structure whose “inner” levels are used purely for communication and decision-making between the groups, as well as co-ordination and planning of projects and dealing with situations that extend beyond the bounds of the local group.</p>
<p>The basic unit of the network is an affinity group, which is a cell of approximately 10 people, located within a reasonable geographical distance from one another. These communities are made up of collections of affinity groups that network together to enhance co-operation and co-ordination.</p>
<p>Existing protocols, some tried and tested, others newly fashioned, and others not yet fashioned, will be adapted to deal with issues of transparency, regulations, agreements, etc. For instance, by using blockchains, the network will itself be developed with technology that requires openness and transparency. Through recording all the transactions there will be accountability. For verification in the case of a dispute, it will be possible to refer to a definitive history to resolve differences through at least one full archive of all these transactions and communications. Smart contract technologies can be used to embed the agreements and regulations in transaction protocols themselves.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on purely technological methods, the identity problem is solved by utilising personal verification, like a reputation-based system,<br>
as a method of verifying someone’s identity.</p>
<p>If sufficient time and resources were available, many people would be willing and able to help fashion and create this system and its interfaces, just as many people have willingly helped build so many facets of the internet and the web, and continue to do so.</p>
<p>A network structure is the most flexible, perhaps the only, format that can achieve the necessary multifaceted platform that would be able to manifest and support a new system of governance.</p>
<p>This network differs from other networks in that it requires a commitment from the members. If we wish to enact a change in the world around us, we have to input energy into the structure that will enable and facilitate that transition.</p>
<p>The network will be built from the ground up. We first gather/identify the people, then create the network, not the other way round.</p>
<p>It is a fully connected, but ordered network – a tree – through which all the people are connected. Just like an organism, the network is all connected, but passes through various pathways in order to reach other parts of the system. Thus we create cells, or affinity groups, that form the basis of this living tree.</p>
<p>Members take responsibility for the members with whom they are affiliated, especially the individuals they have personally invited into the network. Referrals must have meaning. There must be trust in the web that underpins the tree, else it will not be viable.</p>
<p>Potential decisions to be discussed percolate up the network, with the various opinions collated, and then filter back down again once these issues have been finalised. All decisions are voted upon, with most weight being given to those that are most affected. The discussion and voting process takes place within the appropriate context or affected demographic, so that the various parts of the network only need take action within their local purview.</p>
<p>If a project requires more consistent attention, a separate project sub-tree will be formed – a team – that will take responsibility. This team structure will be organised in the most effective manner. Once that particular project is complete, the team will disband until it is needed again. It might be a different group of people that respond to the next occurrence. Leaders will be chosen. One’s reputation will be known – there are methods of using crypto-currencies to gauge interest and popularity – and thus the popular leaders will attract more people who are willing to work with them than leaders who do not treat their teams appropriately.</p>
<p>This is a vital, participatory network, a web that will connect everyone who is willing to support and actively engage in building the structures, especially of governance, that will support and benefit the greater proportion of the population. The more self-supporting, self-reliant, and self-sustaining the network, the more resilient it will be.</p>
<p>It is from those connections that we will build this infrastructure. It is dynamic and responsive, inclusive, open and accountable. It is the platform upon which we can carry out a more effective method of governance, of transacting globally and locally, and hopefully, of achieving a better way of life for the majority of us.</p>
