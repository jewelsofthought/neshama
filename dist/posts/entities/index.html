	<h3>Description:</h3>
	<p>3d entities, thus above is 4d and below 3d.</p>

<h2 id="123-and-4d-entities" tabindex="-1">1,2,3 &amp; 4d entities <a class="direct-link" href="#123-and-4d-entities" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>What if the story consisted of 1d entities - who were never seen, only whose presence was able to be detected. There were many stories of their influence, but no-one is certain.</p>
<p>2d's - all over the place, from virii, to insects. Imagine a 2d encountering a 3d. All it will see are the bottom of your boots - from the side. In fact, if you take a step, it will be almost magic to him, for your boot will dissapear - if he is lucky, he will have a glimpse of the sole of your boot, and then reappear somewhere else, probably a decent distance away for him, but for you, it was just a step. Your voice will come from the &quot;heavens&quot; (G-d knows where that is!) - but somewhere &quot;above&quot; him - if he even has the concept of above, otherwise he will percieve it all around him. You kindly kneel down to show him yourself, but this wierd visage, something he could never recognise, let alone describe will suddenly appear close to him, perhaps as large as a mountain. As he has no depth perception or, for the sake of our story, very limited ability, he will only see a partial image of your visage. Something like those sculptures of a face emerging from a rock. I do not think it will assuage his terror at your appearance.</p>
<p>3d's - to the 3d's you are like an ant, or worse, he might not even be able to perceive you, as he has limited 2d perception - though I propose his consciousness is 2d, though the reality that he live in is 3d. He needs to be trained to live from a 3d perspective and is not necessarily more effective than a 2d entity.</p>
<p>Then above 3d, we encounter, or are &quot;under&quot; 4d, something we can only intuit, but not perceive - as we do not have 4d consciousness. But you have to remember something about consciousness - it is like a wave, and thus is an expression of energy, and energy is infinite in expression. That is, it can and will express itself anywhere. In other words, it will find and outlet, using whatever material is available to express itself. The only manifestation will be like the &quot;waves on the ocean&quot;, soundless but full of sensation/feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Every sensation you feel, every thought you are conscious of, every heartbeat is an expression of the energy that permeates - nay, Is - the entire existence.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-movement" tabindex="-1">The Movement <a class="direct-link" href="#the-movement" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>We call it a &quot;movement&quot;, because of the language we are using, though it might be better and more simply expressed as the Move. Because, in actual fact, it is a movement - though it is not a horizontal movement, as moving from one home to another - but one could almost think of it as a vertical movement - though that too is not accurate. I would like to express it, and hope that it is, a dimensional move. In essence, it may be expressed as the movement into another dimension. Though that is not 100% accurate. It is the inclusion of the awareness of another dimension, and acknowledgement of those who are able to work with and in that dimension. Listen to them.</p>
<h3 id="types" tabindex="-1">Types <a class="direct-link" href="#types" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>There are 2 types of people who joined the movement.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Those who were playing out their childhood traumas</em> - as this space allowed for a wider playing field in which to express these traumas.</p>
<p>This is a natural result of a society becoming more successful and thus more affluent. It allows the inheritors of this affluence a greater sphere of activity, and thus inevitably foster expressions that are challenging to the fabric of the society, and eventually the very fundamental principles upon which it is based.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Those who wished to build a society based on a different, a new narrative</em>. It was if they had heard something, and were awakened to a vision.</p>
<p>None were sure what it was - they just new what it &quot;felt&quot; like, or what they dreamed it could feel like. Many of them went in search of this &quot;feeling&quot;. Some went to the plants to see if they could teach them, some went to the sacred texts and sought answers, some joined cults religious, or otherwise, believing that community was the solution - but it is also the problem. Many believed that the Mother, the earth that nourishes us all, would have the answer - but against the deadly onslaught on everything living that is we are a part of, it is unlikely that there will be any earth left to teach us. We will have turned all the forests into commercial plots by then.</p>
<p>We sat in circles and talked about the vision of the New Earth, and we tried to build communities based on these New Principles, but we inevitably fell back into the patterns we were familiar with, and in all these efforts we saw the same dynamics play itself out - and these were the same dynamics that happened in all groups, whether religious or not, commercial or social.</p>
<p><strong>The Game has to change</strong>. With the same volcanic effect that the theories of quantum dynamics had on classical physics. [Perhaps the very term Quantum Physics is an anachronism, like Real TV. Perhaps this &quot;Quantum Physics&quot; is not physics at all, as everything it talks about is non-physical actually. Yet it does a good job of &quot;proving&quot; its reality. In the same way, if the Shaman could produce results that could be emperically measured (according to the accepted, standard measurments - those measurements that are acceptable to the accepted rules of measurement. This is the same as the impact of a new legal system on indigenous people - which needs always to be backed up by military power) who now have to accept new measurements of social behaviour imposed by the ruling class (which is what actually makes them the &quot;ruling class&quot; - not any inherint human characteristics. Which is why we have more popular respect for the successful entrepeneur, rather than the privileged noblesse. We look at them with the fascinated stare of the mouse watching the snake as it slithers towards it, hoping that it will strike the mouse frozen beside it. We know that these people have the ability to destroy our lives in a moment if they so wish. We fight to hold back their desire to control everyone and everything. But we must remember that they are just scared of the Divine nature of the universe and themselves - which is the last thing they will be able to acknowledge, having spent their entire existence catering to the emperical (measurable according to standard accepted measurements) human nature of their being. And this is an attempt to build walls around the terror of extinction, of not being anymore, forgotten in the ashes of time. So they need to build huge edifices to their greatness, pyramid and towers. They have to fight great wars and accomplish grandiouse (and often idiotic) things - to impress everyone, and everyone can applaud their greatness.</p>
<p>But I ask you O great ones who rule over us and wish to control us like ants, like little slaves to do their bidding, and feed their petty, mostly material, desires with our juices - how large is your pyramid next to the giant nebula that gaze upon us in pity? If you are remembered for a 1000 years, O my Emperor, how long is that in the eyes of our very planet, which your science says has been here for 15,000,000,000 years? Well, I say, however, or whatever built this planet, is going to be remembered for far longer than any one of you will be. And is capable of producing things far greater than any of you, or your wizards, whether of science or magic, could ever hope to imagine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The beauty of this strange Viral time is that it is clearly showing the difference between these two.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Maccabean Test</strong>. We are standing told that in order to continue to live our lives normally, we will need to kiss the ass of the statue of the pig that they have placed in our temples. Is not the &quot;virus&quot; that keeps us from gathering in our temples, and the vaccination that will allow us, the same thing? It is not the virus that is preventing the communial prayer, but the rules of our society that are not allowing us to gather there as they say there is a virus that prevents us. That is the pig they have created and placed there. Now, in taking the virus, you are kissing the statue - you are agreeing, nay willing, your body to act in accordance with the wishes of this new rule. And in doing so, are accepting their mandated behaviour. For to need accept it, is tantamount to revolution. And the punishment for such treason follows soon after. At first, no-one is forced. But once a critical mass is reached - they called it &quot;herd immunity&quot; - the balance will be upset, and they will have to become mandated, because if those who have submitted, believing that the new rule will improve their lot - which is the common mantra of those in power, or who wish to be in power - and it seldom improves the lot of this class, except that the chaos causes movement of certain segments, and when the dust has settled, the system will produce the same situation of the ruled and the rulers. It Are you going to bow to this because you need to earn a living? Or are you going to rather die at Masada, having stood up to your last breath against this evil that is taking over your world?</p>
<p>I know you are chomping at the bit, wondering what is this &quot;new narrative&quot;, as I'm sure you've heard many already, and even perhaps have one or two of your own. But, let those who write stories come up with the myths and legends that will feed us and calm us in the dark nights. What I speak of is the <strong>vision</strong>, that silent sound that cries and moans in the background, hidden half-hidden in the stillness between two waves on the ocean. That something that you struggle to understand that leads you along strange and often uncomfortable paths, and takes you into dark and challenging spaces. Often you too have sufferred trauma as a child - I mean. nowadays we talk of the very trauma of birth</p>
<pre><code>though interesting enough there is little popular talk of the emotional trauma of the solution to that - ripping the baby out of the mother's womb through a pre-birth incision in her belly through which the child now enters the world. Instead of accepting the channel made by G-d, we have superceded it with the man-made entry into the world. Welcome to the new-age of trans-human existence, oh Indigo child.

<h2 id="so-what-is-this-vision-that-i-speak-of" tabindex="-1">So what is this vision, that I speak of? <a class="direct-link" href="#so-what-is-this-vision-that-i-speak-of" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>It is the 4th dimension! To unpack this statement more fully, will take a certain amount of training in the language. Hopefully <a href="dimensions.html">these explanations</a> will help. You can of course just <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/....">google</a> it.</p>
<p>Let me explain from a more humanistic level. We live in a world that we call 3 dimensional. A world that has length, breadth and depth/height.</p>
<pre><code>It is interesting to note that perspective. We have only length - short or long. We could say shortness instead, and do sometimes, but shortness means a very brief length. We never think of long as a very long shortness. Also in its very grammer one can see a difference. Length is a state of something, whereas shortness is a description of a state of something, length is the the measurement of something, and is often called distance - which just clarifies the equivalent adjectival use of long and short. Similarly with breadth and her twin width - which is identical to the constellation of length, and had wide (though not wideness). Though breadth could be looked at as derivative or secondary, as breadth does imply some measurable distance, though distance does not necessarily imply any measurable breadth. Finally, we have depth, which is makes it clear that this is from the perspective of a point or plane of origin, for it implies an above and below.

Before delving into that, let me note that both length and breadth also contain points of origin by implication, something which is not obvious upon speaking of length. Let me explain. Length is easy. It implies a beginning and an end point (and by implication a midpoint - all the rest are debatable). The beginning (or any other point on the line) could be taken as the point of origin. Though, we normally speak of the distance between two points as being the length. I could now speak of breadth in the same manner, but I wish to take you on a slightly different path. Though breadth/width is often thought of in linear terms, i.e. the width of the tunnel, or the breadth of his reach, it is actually more representative of a circle, and thus it becomes actually &quot;the midpoint of the linear measurement of the width of the channel is the &quot;moving point of the center of the circle that is defined by the breadth of the midpoint upon which it moves&quot;. If this channel is uniform, as a highway, then one can measure the breadth by measuring the radius of the circle that is bounded by the width of the road, and you will have your breadth, and your point of origin. One speaks of the average width of a river, that it is narrow at some places and broad at others. But with depth, there is always a height, a dynamic, an up or a down!
</code></pre>
<p>We call it the world of measurement, though more often it is called the emperical world, or more scientificially: based on emperical evidence - which just means &quot;measurable&quot;, or more accurately, &quot;objectively&quot; measurable. In the beginning, we had our senses, and they consisted of 5 measuring instruments, our 5 senses. Interestingly enough, during that &quot;primitive&quot; (I prefer early) period, we also have records of other senses, which have been largely discredited in our modern era. But that is really <a href="neshama.html">another topic</a>. Even those five have been reduced to the three above -</p>
<pre><code>with the demotion of smell, and taste (touch, which has been slowly removed, cannot be exclusively denied, as it is a constant of our existence, and is, in fact, one of our primal senses, together with smell and taste - all 3 of which have been largely superceded by the commercialisatory forces. Taste by sugar &amp; salt and other flavouring; smell by perfumes and deodorants (and now in foods too); touch with the synthetic materials that &quot;feel&quot; like the real thing, with sexual mores, and other such manipulable fashions

<p>dealing almost exclusively in identifiable objects and surfaces in our explorations of our surroundings.</p>
<h3 id="in-summary" tabindex="-1">In summary <a class="direct-link" href="#in-summary" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>The conclusions drawn from data is dependent on the system of measurement used, plus the tools of interpretations.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-revolution" tabindex="-1">Quantum Revolution <a class="direct-link" href="#quantum-revolution" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>All was fine, until we encountered [electricity[(chashmal.html)]. This was something we could only experience. We could not percieve it with any of our 5 senses. It was tremendously useful, and people were dying in their desire and need for its benefits and use. We did not hesitate at the door to this discovery, but rushed madly in - as if it was a new discovery of gold or diamonds - and began using this limitless font of energy we had discovered to benefit &quot;all&quot; [which as per usual, meant first those who could afford, or were lucky enough to be born into, access to it].</p>
<p>No one thought to stop and the doorway and ask &quot;What is it?&quot;. Because we were still in the trance of the certainty of emperical measurements - as many still are. It is an essentially 2d comprehension of the world around us, rather like the behemoth. And so we rushed in, where angels might fear to tread.</p>
<p>So onward intrepid explorers, armed with your electrically powered machines, and let us see what we can do... Well, we live in the <a href="intention.html">outcome</a>. I am old, but, if you are young, you have to live with outcome of your ancestors creations.</p>
<pre><code>**Intention/Outcome**

Time when future was unknown, the focus was on [intent](TalmudicTeachings#intention.html). After having gained some [&quot;control&quot;](control.html) (or so it may seem) - in terms of predictability/probability - of future events, [outcome](outcome.html) becomes as, if not more critical, important as intention was in the ancient and modern times.

These outcomes need to be measured through the same emperical measurements as science is using to measure the &quot;imaginary&quot; energies that are swirling all around us, which we, for many centuries, were generally unaware of (the quantum). And the principles derived by the same principles, and as accurate in prediction as F=ma is in its role of keeping the outcome on target!

&gt; Outcome can only be measured in relation to the dynamics of the system itself. Whether postive or negative depends on the breadth of the measurement of the outcome (whether local or global/general), and its original impetus (what caused it), and its depth (how deep/powerful is its source).
