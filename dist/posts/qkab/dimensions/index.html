<p>Are we essentially planar beings, living in a 3d space like vegetation and animals, who perceive mainly 2d (with a little depth) - like a slice of 3d.</p>
<p>It is essentially a 2d life form in a 3d space, unaware of the 3d space in which it exists, just as a fish is unaware of the water in which it lives - until that moment that it is ripped from it, and suddenly does not understand why it has been taken from it. Thus only by its absence, and thus dying, can it perceive the water which it needed to live.</p>
<p>Perhaps certain humans experience something similar when dying. If God is the ocean of existence, then only upon being removed from that ocean are we suddenly able to understand that we are just like a fish in the ocean.</p>
<p>All living things must be aware that they are alive. We seem to be the only 2d life form that is aware enough of the 3d space in which it exists.</p>
<p>Animals and vegetation are planar because their vector of movement is planar.</p>
<p>For instance, one might think of a tree as a 3D composition, but its thrust, its dynamic, i.e. its mode of growth, is 2D. For it is essentially linear, with its convolutions being due to environmental and other constraints.</p>
<p>That is a branch grows in essentially a straight line, a vector that has a &quot;goal&quot;/direction, and is shaped by environmental influences, emerging not quite as straight as it was meant to be.</p>
<p>Similarly an animal, running on the earth lives essentially on the plane. One sees it with a deer trying to escape from a lion. Most of its evasive manoeuvres are angular - unless the need arises to go around something.</p>
<p>Birds &amp; fish experience an 2D but in an extra dimension. In other words they can experience the 3 axes but as 2D planes. One can see it in the evasive manoeuvres of the bird being hunted by another. but still relate to it as planar.</p>
<h2 id="life" tabindex="-1">Life <a class="direct-link" href="#life" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Living speaks of a certain fluidity, an ongoing dynamic of a certain nature. With inanimate objects, this &quot;life&quot;, this growth is not fluid, but occurs in more discrete steps; plus its growth only affects the object peripherally - perhaps to stabilise its containment.</p>
<p>Living beings also embody an inner consciousness that is expressed in their lives and how we live it.</p>
<p>There is a localised consciousness/will that drives this inanimate object and is a part of their life force i.e. their (involuntary) drive to live. Only humans or imprisoned animals will try to take their own lives.</p>
<p>Thus it is not essentially a planar being, but will just be an objective expression of this life force in whatever dimension it emanates in.</p>
