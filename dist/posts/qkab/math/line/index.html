<p>Every continuous line has a beginning and an end - assuming no loops.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/img/qkab/math/line.png" alt="Line diagram"></p>
<p>There are two ways to designate a straight line:</p>
<ul>
<li>by two points, its beginning point &amp; end point, on the plane</li>
<li>by a vector, which has a beginning point - known as the point of origin, and a distance.</li>
<li>there is another way, which is known as polar co-ordinates, which uses the circle &amp; pi. It describes the line by its angle from the point of origin (with a baseline) and its distance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter two introduces the concept of movement in a certain direction thus that of goal &amp; purpose. Male envisages movement as essentially linear. Thus, with power, he continues in a straight line to his goal, ignoring any collateral damage, and not knowing when he has crossed the line, except after the crossing. The discipline, and constraint, is to know when to stop, when you have reached the &quot;end&quot;.</p>
<p>However, that is not the topic of the moment, just note that this now has three aspects, or parts, that can be designated: beginning, middle and end. This partition can be found elsewhere too, as past, present &amp; future, and inside, skin &amp; outside, etc. One could use this mapping to describe a three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>This is often reduced further (by the effects of egotism, or narcissism) to a two-dimensional space of the border &amp; what is inside - ignoring the actual reality of what is outside the &quot;borders&quot;, however defined. For we &quot;<a href="../consciousness.md">awaken to consciousness</a>&quot; inside, and begin to garner information through our skin of our vessels regarding the &quot;outside&quot;. If that outside is exciting, and inviting, and safe, we are more likely to respond to it, and be open to it. If it is not, we are more likely to create a harder shell of protection from a more hostile environment. This produces binary, us &amp; them, polarised thinking.</p>
<p>On the outside is all that is unknown, and really contains the great adventure of life. For, is it not the Hero's Journey to venture out into the unknown, and, once having overcome all the challenges of his or her encounter(s) with the unknown, returns home a hero?</p>
<p>The third polar fashion is an even more accurate representation of the dynamic of perception. Let us use sight as the example. Our eyes are drawn to look at something. Light travels in a straight line, so what you see is in line with the angle/perspective that you are looking at it from - thus we have angle and direction (and power). This angle is determined by the choice of the &quot;observer&quot; or if, participant, through his entanglement.</p>
<h2 id="line" tabindex="-1">Line <a class="direct-link" href="#line" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>When we envisage a line, we envisage what is &quot;linear momentum&quot;, which is a point that moves along a certain trajectory (in this case, a straight line). However, that is incorrect. The line is actually a set of points, even though it looks like we &quot;draw&quot; the line. The collection we call, in this case, a line.</p>
<p>Two ways to produce a line:</p>
<ol>
<li>As described above</li>
<li>By moving the background (an old movie trick). Remember, the background give the context of whatever &quot;story&quot; is occurring in the foreground.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="time-is-the-background" tabindex="-1">Time is the background <a class="direct-link" href="#time-is-the-background" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Time is the moving background in/upon which everything occurs, and in which our lives unfold. We spend much time trying to remain still, for things to remain as they are - even for a moment. So we practice meditation, to still our minds, so that we can be more prepared for this constant moving background of time in which we exist. Of course, the other option is to try and &quot;move faster than time&quot;. In other words, if I could fore-tell, prophecy, know the future, I would have out-smarted time. Or if I can avoid my time of &quot;death&quot; - perhaps the prime motivator for prophecy, if not a calling. But know this, time marches on inexorably - and to stop time - would be to stop life!</p>
<p>Time actually &quot;is&quot;/becomes the story of your life. Your narrative unfolds in time... Thus we encounter the mystery of the entanglement of time and space - I would call them conjugates.</p>
<p>How would you like it to end? Ideally, not in death, but having achieved your goals, &quot;completed&quot;, so as to say, your life. That you will die (inevitably), but that you would die fulfilled. The drive to reach the place of fulfilment, of peace, of love, or success, is extremely strong, and entwined with the survival instinct, you become so intimate with you own story, that you &quot;become&quot; the story - and lose yourself in it.</p>
<p>Now this background upon which your particular life-story unfolds is a background that has a dynamic and momentum that is its own - and you are just like a leaf floating on the river, or a feather floating in the air, buffetted by the currents around you. You are born into the background, you will live in it, and die in &amp; from it. It is, and you are but just a moment in it.</p>
<p>Thus you can</p>
<ol>
<li>Ego: Fight this bg<br>
This is the alpha personality. The big person, who will make his stamp on history.</li>
<li>Submission: Accept this bg<br>
This is the one who is disempowered, and submits to his fate.</li>
<li>Flow: Merge with it</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="flow" tabindex="-1">Flow <a class="direct-link" href="#flow" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This is the ideal. It is to live as a servant to G-d, and try to obey His Will. That sounds so Biblical, doesn't it. So let's translate that into the much more complex modern vernacular. There are certain laws and principles of Nature and the Universe that if we don't obey, we will find ourselves in trouble. Try to ignore the law of Gravity, etc.</p>
<p>What we don't take into account, that those areas that we are unable to measure, or unable to perceive, or are not even aware of, still continue to affect the system and our lives. This is the question that the Zen koan asks: &quot;What sound does the tree make in the forest when it falls, if there is no-one to hear it?&quot; Put more simply, even though it is unknown, it still can have a huge effect on the outcome.</p>
<p>Think of it from a child perspective. As an adult, you know things that the child does not. You are aware of influences and effects and outcomes that the child is not. Hopefully he will in time, but that is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>So it is with us, and our Father.</p>
<p>This is exactly the scenario we are struggling with at present.</p>
<p>But, let's keep our focus on the individual. It is easier to comprehend - and even perhaps more useful. Encountering this background through a patchwork collection of interactions, we create our taperstry - which I call my story. This is who I am. This is what I do. This is my name. This is my profession. I am a doctor, worker, employee, president... We differentiate and separate ourselves by our narratives. Do you agree with my version (thesis), or not (antithesis) - now you are a potential threat to who/what I am.</p>
<p>If I seek conflict, or reject your version, we remain stuck in this perpetual cycle of thesis vs. antithesis. But, synthesis is a choice!</p>
<p>Similar is my relationship with this background. I can submit, which is the general notion, and the easiest. Or I can try and fight it. If I lose, I pay the price for rejecting it. If I win, I am successful - but estranged from it. So I will need to surround myself with a bastion of others who will benefit similarly from my/our success. This requires us to create and maintain our version of the what is really happening in this background. So we build a &quot;system&quot;, a society, in which we can hold this narrative, which has succeeded for me and my supporters. The end result is that you believe so completely in this narrative that you relate to it as if the narrative (and not the actual event) is real - and made of real things that cannot be changed. [Ala <strong>Wisdom Mantra</strong> - G-d grant me the Wisdom...]</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why it has been called an &quot;ego trip&quot;. Because your ego has identified (and been nourished) by this story, that you begin to fully live it - and thus now perpetuate it - so that it does become &quot;real&quot;. Real laws, real prison, real weapons, real killing.</p>
<p>The success of this venture will always depend on how true its description of the background is.<br>
So, to the most balanced and productive relationship with this background within which we exist, would be to synthesise with it. To &quot;dance&quot; together with it. Like a surfer riding a wave to the shore. This is called &quot;<a href="../flow.html">Being in the Flow</a>&quot;. It is attuning yourself to the current of time you are in. As we say: &quot;It is not the right time&quot;, &quot;It is time for you to...&quot;, etc.</p>
<h2 id="formlessness" tabindex="-1">Formlessness <a class="direct-link" href="#formlessness" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>What do we have? We have the background. We have the point - which we called the &quot;beginning&quot; - and it exists somewhere inside this background. This is the only point of reference we have, which we also refer to as &quot;the point of origin&quot;. This is a &quot;static&quot; point, in relation to whatever line is formed. If the line is continuous and coherent (can be tracked) - then we can always find the beginning... But, that point is not real anymore. It happened, and it could take billions of years for you to realise that. And the only place you can realise it from is your present point of awareness - which the moment you are aware of, it changes! Thus the only solution to this conundrum is to enter a state of formlessness and merge, become One, with the background, like a fish in the water. So that you can flow with the currents of time, holding your self, not your position or your place in the story. Remember, like reading a book. You remember your place so that you can return to that story and continue where you left off. But once you continue, you no longer need the bookmark. And to remember every bookmark along the way, would be foolish - and never let you get on with the story.</p>
<h2 id="memories" tabindex="-1">Memories <a class="direct-link" href="#memories" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Are memories real? Is History a true rendering of events and how they unfolded? Or are they always and only the stories by the victors and the survivors.</p>
<h2 id="which-way-inf-less-greater1" tabindex="-1">Which way [ inf &lt;-&gt;1 ]? <a class="direct-link" href="#which-way-inf-less-greater1" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Because any narrative that attemps to describe the &quot;real&quot; world(s) we live in can only approach this from one of two perspectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Outside [ infinite -&gt; 1 ]: From the perspective of the infinite to the finite (inf -&gt; 1)</li>
<li>Inside [ 1 -&gt; infinite]: From the separate point of individual consciousness expanding into the unknown realms of the possibly infinite.<br>
A gap that the finite can never bridge, because the finite cannot contain the infinite - whereas the infinite can contain and infinite, <a href="infinity.html">unimaginable amount of finites</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="in-the-beginning" tabindex="-1">In the beginning <a class="direct-link" href="#in-the-beginning" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>In the beginning was the absolute totality of the infinite of infinities, <em>Ein Sof Aur</em>. Perfection reigns, endless peace and harmony, no disturbance, no ripple.... complete nothingness - and infinite ocean of bliss. Upon this background it is impossible to depict anything, to say anything. For how could one use finite minds to describe an infinite event? However, something changed, something shifted, something happened to disturb this endless emptiness, and we say that &quot;a point emerged&quot; ex-nihilo - out of nothing. We call this &quot;the beginning&quot;. This is know as the centre - or middle point.</p>
