      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>Everything exists betwee 0 &amp; 1</p>
    <div class="main-content">
      <p>There is a 1-1 correspondence between any set and the real numbers between 0 &amp; 1.</p>
<h2 id="&quot;i-am-that-i-am&quot;" tabindex="-1">&quot;I am that I am&quot; <a class="direct-link" href="#&quot;i-am-that-i-am&quot;" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Only the Divine, Great Spirit is expressed by &quot;I am that I am&quot;.</p>
<p>In a sense, it represents the trivial statement, the one of identity, represented by $1 = 1$.</p>
<p>However, the truth behind it is this: I am the only I that is fully I. In other words I am the only I that fulfils $I = I$. Everything else is $&lt; 1$, incomplete, not fully realised, still in flux.</p>
<h2 id="everything-exists-between-0-and-1." tabindex="-1">Everything exists between 0 &amp; 1. <a class="direct-link" href="#everything-exists-between-0-and-1." aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>How can I say that?</p>
<p>Before I continue, let me set the field. There are certain constraints within which I make that statement, which will become apparent. There even might be an exception to this rule that someone may think of. Thus, I will say that this statement is correct, with a negligible margin of error.</p>
<h2 id="atom-of-existence" tabindex="-1">Atom of Existence <a class="direct-link" href="#atom-of-existence" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Rather than launch into a rigorous rationalisation of this idea, I would like to present it rather as a story of an unfolding. This story starts with an awareness of being aware, - something which I like to refer to as &quot;The Axiom/Atom of Existence&quot;. All I know, without a doubt, is that I am alive, and aware. I exist.... I am... I am the 1. which we represent in our language, interesting enough as 'I'.</p>
<p>In the beginning I am not aware of the end, or that there is even an end. A major step in consciousness is the realisation that I am going to die - which puts the I-story into a greater context. That is, although I live my life, something else—the same something that somehow enabled me to now awaken in this &quot;place&quot;—will at some unknown point, once again remove this particular awareness that I am now expressing (by writing this – for instance).</p>
<p>This I-ness is not yet an aware $I$. It is just conscious of its I-ness. For this $i$, it's I-ness is a fact (or life, one could say). It takes many years (six or so, I believe), for the 'i' to become aware of its I. And it actually only becomes real, upon authentically encountering another I - which will generally happen through love, if 1 is lucky enough to experience it.<a href="I.html">The journey of the I</a></p>
<p>My story begins with the one I am becoming, in the all that 'I am not'. Now, one thing one know(s), is that there was a time when there was no-one. As far as one was concerned, there was no other one, 'no-thing', at very least, no one. So one decided to give itself a name, and called itself Point. So we say that this one can be represent ed by a point.</p>
<p><a href="excluded_mid.html">excluded_middle</a>{This is also an expression of what is known as the principle of the excluded middle: if P then there exists a ~P. For everything that exists there is an equal and opposite, if only in potential. Or, with something everyone is familiar with: &quot;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction&quot;. This applies to energy, but I propose that it applies to everything - though not necessarily equal and opposite by our standards of measurement.}</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it, is that every shape has a positive version and a negative one. For instance the triangle has both an inner triangle, and an outer one. Why is this a positive and a negative? Well, if we think from the perspective of the triangle, then everything inside the triangle is part of triangle, and everything outside of triangle is out of triangle, like $t+$ and $t-$.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/img/qkab/triangle-neg.png" alt="Pos/Neg triangle"></p>
<p>This other I, we give the concept of 0, or zero - nothingness. Before I existed, what was there? When I don't exist anymore, what is there? So, we signify the other as 0, and the I, the point of existence, as 1. And this point 0, we can also represent as a point, or rather the non-point (or place).</p>
<p>Thus we have two points, 0 &amp; 1, and the &quot;line&quot; or space/time between them.</p>
<h2 id="unpack" tabindex="-1">Unpack <a class="direct-link" href="#unpack" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Start with number 1 (me, I). Think of it as a moment in &quot;time&quot; in which I (1) appear(s).</p>
<p>If 1 is aware, then there must have been a time when 1 was unaware, and as such, 1 did not exist, and that point we can represent as 0. In fact, we can represent this occurrence as 1 - 1 = 0.</p>
<p>This is a statement we are all familiar with. But if we break it down philosophically, it reads something like: If we remove (subtract) the 1 which has appeared, with another 1, then we will, in essence, have annihilated the 1st 1, and produced nothing, or emptiness, which is 0 - nothingness.</p>
<p>Now we have a 1, and a 0 - something &amp; nothing. As well as an action (subtraction), from which we can almost propose the state of nothingness. Using our previous formulation, we could say the for every 1, there is a not-1, or ~1. So there naturally needs to be a process by which we can merge them somehow.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, by only having the basic process of addition, '+', which is easily followed, by the example of if I have an apple, and you give me another apple then I have in my basket, 2 apples, an apple plus another apple... That is quite natural.</p>
<p>For the previous case, I could rephrase my statement as<br>
1 + (~1). Which says: If I have an apple in my basket, and I add a &quot;non-apple&quot; to it, it will cancel out the apple and I will have an empty basket.</p>
<h2 id="complimentarity" tabindex="-1">Complimentarity <a class="direct-link" href="#complimentarity" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This also illustrates the Principle of the Anti, or the: &quot;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction&quot;, illustrated also in quantum theory, where for sub-atomic particle, there exists an anti-particle.</p>
<p>I extend the statement to: &quot;For every object in the universe, there is an equal and opposite object&quot;. And I use the example of the triangle to show this (see fig on left, and refer to 'The 3 spaces' page).</p>
