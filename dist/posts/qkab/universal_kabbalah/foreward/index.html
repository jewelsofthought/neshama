<p>She had an uncanny intuitive sense about the connection between the divine and humanity, and having had a profound spiritual experience, after being touch by an Indian mystic, went about finding the tools by which to express this enormous insight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Within the Jewish esoteric tradition humankind plays a pivotal role in the perfection of the divine personality by uniting the finite with the infinite.</strong></p>

<p>Leet attempted to erect a new framework for understanding the mechanism of the transformative spiritual work that enables the human soul to reach increasingly higher dimensions of consciousness.</p>

<p>Provides access to Jewish spirituality as a means for achieving higher consciousness. A path that could deepen the devotions of both non-observant and observant Jews. This process of <strong>covenant renewal</strong> begins with effective kabbalistic techniques of meditation, combining mantra with visualisation; then proceeds through the return to a &quot;reconstructed <strong>Sinai-Sabbath</strong>&quot;; and arrives at the culminating practice of ritual prayer, the performance of which can fulfill the kabbalistic purpose of creation. This process has hellp many to discover forms of spiritual practice precisely tailored for the modern world, as well as a new appreciation for the rich spiritual heritage of Judaism.</p>
<p>Explores the false temptations of worldy power and pleasure that lead to the fall of the soul and the meaans of its redemption. Through a powerful meditative technique called <strong>the Transformative Moment</strong>, the workings of which are exemplified by Jacob and Joseph and which allow the individual to progress all the higher levels of the soul, and even to attain the miraculous powers of the legendary spiritual masters. Further correlating the hierarchy of soul levels with Ezekiel's throne vision to show the various paths the soul may travel toward self-realisation: sex, love, power, knowledge, holiness and unification. The first four paths relate to the four-faced living creatures (<em>Chayot</em>) of Ezekiel's vision--the bull-ox, lion, eagle and man. The final two paths relate to the prophet and the envisioned image on the throne that he recognises to be his divine higher self--the knowledge that defines the secret doctrine of the whole of the Jewish mystical tradition culminating in the Kabbalah.</p>
<p>This required a vast reconstruction of the knowledge of the ancient Jewish priest-scientists, with vital implications for contemporary spirituality and science. What emerges is Kabbalah as an ancient Hebrew sacred science that used geometry, sound and number to linke the finite world of human experience with the infinite realm of the divine, using teachings extending back thousands of years to explicate key concepts of quantum physics and quantum cosmology.</p>

<p>Resurrects this ancient body of knowledge to reveal eternal truths that could have a profound and positive effect on contemporary spirituality. This text is an exploration of Hebraic sacred science that explains as never before the meaning of the central cosmological diagram of the entire Western esoteric--the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is shown to enshrine a key to the purpose of the cosmos, a key that has vast implications for modern physics and cosmology. Taking what has always been a two-dimensional model of the famous kabbalistic tree of anthropos and projecting a three-dimensional body more common to other hermetic traditions. The final synthesis is a culmination in which the universe and its divine child, <em>perfected</em> humanity, achieve that union of the finite and infinite that has ever been the secret goal of the Kabbalah.</p>

<li>Reconcile the more scientific aspects of the highly technical sacred science with the inner connection of her longing and desire so eloquently described in her literary work

<li>Unconditional love and the warrior:<br>
Both are involved with the conversion of love into power albeit with a difference: The lover's slefless concern to empower the powerless diffuses his/her power, while the self-possession of the spiritual knight concentrates it. It is this concentration that is needed to direct spiritual power into manifestation, a concentration that depends upon possessing rather than losing the self. Such possession is also different from</li>
