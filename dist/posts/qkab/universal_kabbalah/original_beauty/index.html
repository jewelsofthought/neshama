<h2 id="man-is-not-evil.-man-is-good." tabindex="-1">Man is NOT evil. Man is GOOD. <a class="direct-link" href="#man-is-not-evil.-man-is-good." aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Change core premise.<br>
We now that religion though touted often as the solution or panacea to prevent or &quot;reduce&quot; the amount of evil in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Only way to reduce the darkness is to increase the light!</strong></p>
<p>And has been most often used as a tool/weapon of oppression and power.</p>
<p>Now, if man is essentially evil, and a &quot;sinner&quot;, according to current religious view, then one must assume that our leaders - who are just human - are evil too!</p>
<p>Which will bring us to the conclusion that we are in the grip of a powerful, oppressive group of evil leaders!</p>
<p>The &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; approach. However, guilt is decided according to the criterion and biases of the legal context within which this guilt is being decided. In the case of religion, there is the application of the laws of God according to the perspective and understanding of that particular culture - all influenced by human foibles and weaknesses and desires.</p>
<p>In fact, this premise of intrinsicly evil, has resulted in the doctrine of &quot;Orignal Sin&quot;. Which proposes that God made us, and the world around us, essentially evil. If it is, in this case, up to Christ to redeem us, at worst. At best, for each one of us to make the right choices - even when we receive the wrong education - one that teaches us how to serve in society, but not how to deal with the moral, ethical or spiritual aspects of one's life.</p>
<h2 id="why-create-evil" tabindex="-1">Why create Evil? <a class="direct-link" href="#why-create-evil" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>If God is Good, why create evil people? No. Rather, why create everyone evil, and then we need to spend the rest of our lives &quot;redeeming&quot; ourselves? It is like being born in debt, and having to spend the rest of your lives paying someone back for the debt you &quot;inherited&quot;.</p>
<p>If one has a purpose, would you not want those that you exercise influence and control over to be performing their true work, expressing their G-d given gifts for the benefit of all? In other words, would not a true leader look after his people - not like a shepherd herding his sheep because as is said: &quot;The sheep spend all their lives afraid of the wolf, when it is the shepherd who they need to fear!&quot;? Ensure and enable them to express their best, obey the will of G-d, so as to say? Would not a King have to be a priest as well? Or at least a Shaman? Able to guide His people - just like Moses?</p>
<p>Instead we fritter our way our time and resources, and many lives, fighting this very evil placed in us? Perhaps this acceptance of an intrinsic sin in the human being is incorrect. We arrive neither intrinsically good nor bad and are formed and &quot;taught&quot; by the influences and general environment we grow up in. We are shaped by what we encounter during our &quot;<a href="../consciousness.md">awakening into consciousness</a>&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are surrounded by love, you learn love</li>
<li>If you are surrounded by anger and violence, you learn love that is consists of anger and violence...</li>
</ul>
<p>In this realm, there are no absolutes - besides birth &amp; death. &quot;Every natural law has an exception&quot;. So, there are some who are bad - and some who are good. And their influences wax and wane, in an eternal cosmic dance. Thus, any system has to take into account the bad extremes. In the words of Warren Buffet: &quot;It is not a victory that will ever wipe you out. But one loss certainly can.&quot; In every barrel, in every toss, there is the possibility (however slight) of a &quot;bad&quot; apple.</p>
