<p>So what is this vision, that I speak of?</p>
<p>It is the 4th dimension! To unpack this statement more fully, will take a certain amount of training in the language. Hopefully <a href="dimensions.html">these explanations</a> will help. You can of course just <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/....">google</a> it.</p>
<p>Let me explain from a more humanistic level. We live in a world that we call 3 dimensional. A world that has length, breadth and depth/height.</p>
<pre><code>It is interesting to note that perspective. We have only length - short or long. We could say shortness instead, and do sometimes, but shortness means a very brief length. We never think of long as a very long shortness. Also in its very grammer one can see a difference. Length is a state of something, whereas shortness is a description of a state of something, length is the the measurement of something, and is often called distance - which just clarifies the equivalent adjectival use of long and short. Similarly with breadth and her twin width - which is identical to the constellation of length, and had wide (though not wideness). Though breadth could be looked at as derivative or secondary, as breadth does imply some measurable distance, though distance does not necessarily imply any measurable breadth. Finally, we have depth, which is makes it clear that this is from the perspective of a point or plane of origin, for it implies an above and below.

Before delving into that, let me note that both length and breadth also contain points of origin by implication, something which is not obvious upon speaking of length. Let me explain. Length is easy. It implies a beginning and an end point (and by implication a midpoint - all the rest are debatable). The beginning (or any other point on the line) could be taken as the point of origin. Though, we normally speak of the distance between two points as being the length. I could now speak of breadth in the same manner, but I wish to take you on a slightly different path. Though breadth/width is often thought of in linear terms, i.e. the width of the tunnel, or the breadth of his reach, it is actually more representative of a circle, and thus it becomes actually &quot;the midpoint of the linear measurement of the width of the channel is the &quot;moving point of the center of the circle that is defined by the breadth of the midpoint upon which it moves&quot;. If this channel is uniform, as a highway, then one can measure the breadth by measuring the radius of the circle that is bounded by the width of the road, and you will have your breadth, and your point of origin. One speaks of the average width of a river, that it is narrow at some places and broad at others. But with depth, there is always a height, a dynamic, an up or a down!

<p>We call it the world of measurement, though more often it is called the emperical world, or more scientificially: based on emperical evidence - which just means &quot;measurable&quot;, or more accurately, &quot;objectively&quot; measurable. In the beginning, we had our senses, and they consisted of 5 measuring instruments, our 5 senses. Interestingly enough, during that &quot;primitive&quot; (I prefer early) period, we also have records of other senses, which have been largely discredited in our modern era. But that is really <a href="neshama.html">another topic</a>. Even those five have been reduced to the three above dealing almost exclusively in identifiable objects and surfaces in our explorations of our surroundings.</p>
<pre><code>with the demotion of smell, and taste (touch, which has been slowly removed, cannot be exclusively denied, as it is a constant of our existence, and is, in fact, one of our primal senses, together with smell and taste - all 3 of which have been largely superceded by the commercialisatory forces. Taste by sugar &amp; salt and other flavouring; smell by perfumes and deodorants (and now in foods too); touch with the synthetic materials that &quot;feel&quot; like the real thing, with sexual mores, and other such manipulable fashions
