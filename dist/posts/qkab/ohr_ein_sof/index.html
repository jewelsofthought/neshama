<p>The texts say that this event occurred many times over at the same time. Infinite points spreading out equally from the middle point. It was once thought the there were areas where the universe was being created, and others were it was being destroyed, constantly. There is a cosmological explanation from science that speaks of the hyper-inflationary universe. This universe emerges (is emerging?) in the same fashion.</p>
<p>However that may be, it is certain that there was not a single event.</p>
<p>Another way to think of this, is that until there are more than one event, and these events interact in some form or fashion, there is nothing that can happen. Thus although there might be information contained in this single event, unless there is another event interacting with it, this event will have absolutely no effect on anything, except itself! <a href="narcissism.html">narcissism</a></p>
<p>{NOTE: Thus we have 3 identifiable things - 2 events &amp; some sort of interaction between the two. Then that interaction can affect one (or both) of these events. We could say we have two points and a line between them. That &quot;line&quot;, if itself represented as a point (of notice), a triangle (or triplet) would be a clearer symbol to represent that situation with. However, one could say that that triangle needs to be situated in a space that is not quite this space. It extends along a different dimension or axis as is more commonly known. If another event emerged out of two, or more,connected, or more events, would we then have a triangle emerging.}</p>

<h2 id="invitation" tabindex="-1">Invitation <a class="direct-link" href="#invitation" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This is an invitation to take a walk with me into one of the hallowed pathways of ancient wisdom. Remember that these wisdom texts do not speak of a world that is subject to change, a world that takes up time or space (as we know it), but another world, the <em>Olam Ha’ba</em>, the World to Come, a “spiritual” realm. I hesitate to call it a “realm”, as it is not another place, but one that already exists, waiting for us to claim it and thus change the world we now live in – the World to Come!</p>
<p>It is difficult for those unfamiliar with this territory, as they perceive matters by means of corporeal boundaries of time and space, change and exchange, cause and effect. However, in this text, the authors only use these concepts as signs (or symbols) to point to their “Upper Roots”, their higher spiritual manifestation.</p>
<p>“Higher” here only meaning “closer to the Source”. It could also mean “higher”, or more subtle, vibrations or frequency – pointing out that higher and lower are in relation to an agreed upon measurement. Whereas in the spiritual sense, higher would mean closer to the Truth – and that would translate to mean having more information (and intelligence to receive this information) regarding the real nature of existence and life.</p>
<p>This then is my attempt to render what has been spoken in a different language, at a different time, and in a different cultural milieu into this time and with the concepts and symbols that we have available at this present time – many of which have been carried from the shoulders of our ancestors.</p>
<h2 id="references-not-real" tabindex="-1">References, not real <a class="direct-link" href="#references-not-real" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Before we begin, it is important to underline the fact that all of this is based on spiritual matters that do not take up space and time. Bear in mind, that the entire wisdom of Kabbalah is founded on spiritual matters that do not take up time or space. They are not subject to change or absence and all the changes that are spoken of in this wisdom do not imply that the first form becomes absent and is replaced by a different form. The above change rather implies an additional form, while the first does not move from its place, as absence and change are corporeal conducts.</p>
<p>For that reason I will make an effort to give every word its spiritual identity, detached of space, time and change. It is upon the readers to memorize the meaning of these words thoroughly, for it is impossible to repeat them every time.</p>
<p>We begin with the <strong>Tzimtzum Aleph</strong>, the First Constraint, which occurred when the Infinite Supernal Presence restricted itself in order to enable the Emanation and thus create creation. Now, before this occurred, there only existed the Void, <em>Ein Sof</em>, which filled everything, everywhere, all the time. That was all there was. This creation/constraint occurred around a single point, which we call the middle point, producing a space that emanated after that was circular, because <em>Ohr Ein Sof</em>, the Infinite Presence, is perfect and balanced, thus the Constraint was also even. This is meaning of <strong>Agol</strong>, the Circle.</p>
<p>In all of this resides a mystery for it says that the reason for all of this, for all of creation, was “the revelation of Its Names and Appellations!&quot; Why would It need us to “reveal” Its names and appelations? What does it really mean, for the Upper Simple Light to “reveal”? Is it by us “revealing” Its names, It is revealed? Is it like a marriage? As you spend more time together, you understand the other, and thus your spouse is “revealed” in the same way?</p>
<pre><code>1. Know, that before the Emanations were emanated and the Creations created, an Upper Simple Light[^1] had filled the entire reality.[^2] There was no vacant place,[^3] such as empty Air[^4] or a Space,[^5] but everything was filled with that simple, boundless Presence of Light.[^6] There was no idea of the Beginning nor of the End.[^7] All was One, Simple Light,[^8] completely balanced,[^9] called the Infinite Light, _Ohr Ein Sof_. [^10]
</code></pre>
<p>Here we are describing in more detail what actually occurred at this momentous event, the one we might today know as the Big Bang Theory of Creation. It begins by emphasizing the fact that before anything emanated, or was created, there was only the Upper Simple Light, אור עליון פשוט, which filled everything, leaving no space vacant. This light expanded from the Vitality (strength, force, power) of the Creator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me remind you that all the names and appellations used in the wisdom of the Kabbalah are never referring to the Vitality of the Creator but only to the Light that expands (or emanates) from Its Vitality. We are unable to utter a single word regarding Its Power, for the rule is that anything we do not attain, we do not know its name. Remember that and you will not fail!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="footnotes" tabindex="-1">Footnotes <a class="direct-link" href="#footnotes" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two rudiments concerning these Worlds and Souls, we should discern in reality before us:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are fixed and exist in the Presence, Ein Sof, in all their measure and their glory.</li>
<li>How they are arranged and hang down and innovate before us after the First Constraint, <strong>Tzimtzum Aleph</strong>, in the five Worlds: the Divine Template, Emanation, Creation, Foundation and Action - the Manifest Realm, Kingdom of Heaven – <em>Adam Kadmon</em>, <em>Atzilut</em>, <em>Beria</em>, <em>Yetzira</em> and <em>Assiya</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Upper Light that extends from His Will, also known as his Vigour, or Power - <em>Atzmut</em> - “had filled the entire reality.” This refers to the entire reality relating to their existence in the Void, Ein Sof, before the Constraint occurred. The Upper Light filled them entirely, until they had no vacant place left where correction and perfection could be added whatsoever.</p>
<p>Because of the <strong>Tzimtzum</strong> there came about a wanting and a vacant place for the corrections. However, do not be mistaken to think that this book speaks of a corporeal place.</p>
<p>The Light of Wisdom is the expression of the vitality of the Face. The Light of Mercy only operates as a clothing or veiling over this Light, since the Light of Wisdom cannot permeate the <em>Partzuf</em> if it does not wear the Light of Mercy first.</p>
<p>However, sometimes, when this Face is constricted, it only has <em>Ohr de Hassadim</em>. You should know that that the Light of Mercy is called Air, or sometimes Wind – <em>Avir</em>, or <em>Ruach</em>. When it is by itself, without the Light of Wisdom, it is called “empty Air”. Then it waits for the Light of Wisdom to fulfil it.</p>
<p>Before the Worlds were created such empty Air did not exist in reality at all, because there was not any earth there.</p>
<p>Know, that the amount of that Desire and yearning is the entire substance that exists in the <em>Ne’etzal</em>. Thus, everything that exists in the <em>Ne’etzal</em> that is not that substance, no longer relates to its substance, but to the Abundance that it receives from the <em>Ma'atzil</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this substance determines the Importance, <em>Gadlut</em> [greatness, eminence, importance], and the level of each <em>Ne’etzal</em>, each <em>Partzuf</em>, and each <em>sefirah</em>. The Dissemination of the Supernal Light from the <em>Ma'atzil</em> is certainly immeasurable, but it is the <em>Ne’etzal</em> that limits the Flow, for it receives no more and no less than its measure of desire to receive. This is the criterion in spirituality, because there is no coercion there; it depends entirely on the Desire to Receive..</p>
<p>For that reason we call this will to receive the “Vessel of Reception” of the <em>Ne’etzal</em>. It is regarded as its substance and the reason that it stopped being regarded as a <em>Ma'atzil</em> and was denominated as a Ne’etzal. The Ne’etzal is defined by a substance that does not exist in the Ma'atzil whatsoever, for there is absolutely no will to receive in the Ma'atzil.</p>
<p>There are four degrees in this substance, from Smallness, <em>Katnut</em> [smallness, insignificance] to Greatness, <em>Gadlut</em> of reception. The fourth degree, being the Greatness of the reception, is complete only in the Void, <em>Ein Sof</em>, before the Worlds were created. It is the only one that was subject to the Constraint, <em>Tzimtzum</em>, and we will clarify henceforth that it was emptied of every Flow that it had from the Void, <em>Ein Sof</em>, and remained a vacant Space. This is what the Sage means when he says that before the World was created this vacant Space did not exist.</p>
