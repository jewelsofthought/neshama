<p>What if the story consisted of 1d entities - who were never seen, only whose presence was able to be detected. There were many stories of their influence, but no-one is certain.</p>
<p>2d's - all over the place, from virii, to insects. Imagine a 2d encountering a 3d. All it will see are the bottom of your boots - from the side. In fact, if you take a step, it will be almost magic to him, for your boot will dissapear - if he is lucky, he will have a glimpse of the sole of your boot, and then reappear somewhere else, probably a decent distance away for him, but for you, it was just a step. Your voice will come from the &quot;heavens&quot; (G-d knows where that is!) - but somewhere &quot;above&quot; him - if he even has the concept of above, otherwise he will percieve it all around him. You kindly kneel down to show him yourself, but this wierd visage, something he could never recognise, let alone describe will suddenly appear close to him, perhaps as large as a mountain. As he has no depth perception or, for the sake of our story, very limited ability, he will only see a partial image of your visage. Something like those sculptures of a face emerging from a rock. I do not think it will assuage his terror at your appearance.</p>
<p>3d's - to the 3d's you are like an ant, or worse, he might not even be able to perceive you, as he has limited 2d perception - though I propose his consciousness is 2d, though the reality that he live in is 3d. He needs to be trained to live from a 3d perspective and is not necessarily more effective than a 2d entity.</p>
<p>Then above 3d, we encounter, or are &quot;under&quot; 4d, something we can only intuit, but not perceive - as we do not have 4d consciousness. But you have to remember something about consciousness - it is like a wave, and thus is an expression of energy, and energy is infinite in expression. That is, it can and will express itself anywhere. In other words, it will find and outlet, using whatever material is available to express itself. The only manifestation will be like the &quot;waves on the ocean&quot;, soundless but full of sensation/feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Every sensation you feel, every thought you are conscious of, every heartbeat is an expression of the energy that permeates - nay, Is - the entire existence.</strong></p>
