<p>These are my personal notes that I made when I read: Prager, Rabbi Marcia (1998) <em>Path Of Blessing</em>: Experiencing the Energy and Abundance of the Divine, Jewish Lights. When I make notes, they are just to jog my own memory of the book, so I am aware that they may not always make sense to the general reader. However, I hope they are of some use to you, and perhaps also inspire you to read the book itself. The ideas that I put in square brackets do not come from the writer of the book, but are my own responses as I read; references to ‘Zalman’ mean Rabbi Zalman Shachter-Shalomi (z’l).</p>

<h2 id="alef" tabindex="-1">Alef <a class="direct-link" href="#alef" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>[Aleph is the place to where G-d withdraws to make space for Otherness, for Creation. It is the place where all giving originates.]</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Aleph</em> to <em>Beit</em> – “the Wholly One becomes the Holy One” [beautiful!!] {Or the holy becomes the Whole One.}</li>
<li><em>Beit</em> in <em>gematria</em> is 2; house</li>
<li>The story of abundance begins with <em>beit</em> (2)</li>
<li><em>Reish</em> = 200; head, container-ness</li>
<li><em>Kaf</em> = 20; cupped hands</li>
<li>On a <em>gematria</em> table, <em>beit-reish-kaf</em> = 222</li>
<li><em>Breicha</em> = pool / fountain</li>
<li><em>Baruch</em> is powerful in itself</li>
<li><em>Bereich</em> = knee</li>
<li>G-d travels incognito and suddenly, with awe, we notice.</li>
<li>Humility is knowing we are part of something much bigger</li>
<li>I recognise myself, and therefore you also, as sacred What is your story? What can you touch in me?</li>
<li>We are all part of G-d, and have a role to play</li>
<li>Humility means living in the bond of connectedness {empathy}</li>
<li><em>Anavah</em>/humility — most expanded and most mundane consciousness are in harmony.</li>
<li>Cantillation shows strong break in between the two words <em>Ya’akov Ya’akov</em>, but smoothness between Moshe Moshe; Dov Baer says that &quot;Moses’ two levels of consciousness were in harmony in Moses who was humble, but not in Jacob.&quot; (Rabbi Dov Baer, Maggid of Mezritch)</li>
<li>We can develop the harmonious consciousness.</li>
<li>Moshe constant consciousness; Ya’akov moments of consciousness.</li>
<li>True humility is true nobility</li>
<li><em>Pesel</em> = idol, something less than whole (<em>pasul</em> = Torah with an scribe’s error in it)</li>
<li><strong>Serve G-d, the Source of Life and Creation</strong>, and be true</li>
</ul>

<p>Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berdichev wrote a powerful invocation that reads as a sacred love-poem:</p>
<pre><code>Du, Du, Du!
You! You! You!
I want to sing a ‘You-Song’ to You!
Du, Du, Du!
Where can I find You?
And where can I not find You?
Wherever I go: You! – Wherever I stay: You!Only You! – None but You! – Again You!
Always You!Du, Du, Du, Du!
When things go well: You! – G-d forbid, ill: You!
Ay, Du, Du, Du … Du, Du, Du!
Du, Du, Du … Du, Du, Du!
You, You, You!
Skyward: You! Earth: You! Above: You! Below: You!
Du, Du, Du … Du, Du, Du!
You! You! You!
Wherever I turn myself: You!
Wherever I remain: You!
Du!
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Only the language of relationship can take me to G-d. I must know You.</li>
<li>Intimacy with G-d – see G-d (shimmering) in everything</li>
<li>&quot;Every ‘you’ is G-d, and must be in order not to become a ‘use-object’.&quot; (Heschel)</li>
<li>Buber’s I-Thou inspired by his declining company to a boy who later committed suicide.</li>
<li>“All real living is meeting” (Buber)</li>
<li>‘You’ is my affirmation of G-d and that we can be in relationship with G-d</li>
<li>‘Image of G-d’ means we are ‘theomorphic’ (not that G-d is like us). [NB G-d is not in our image.]</li>
<li>‘Thou’ (and therefore Consciousness) is the Ground of Being</li>
<li>We/I am a result of G-d’s longing to express and be known [which means you are too]</li>
<li><em>panim el panim</em> to know G-d ‘face to face’</li>
<li>In our turning to face G-d, G-d turns to face us [‘Face’ – Levinas]</li>
<li>Feminine = <em>brucha at</em></li>
<li>Ancient forms of ‘you’, <em>ati</em> (fem.) <em>atah</em> (masc.) differ in final letters <em>yud</em> and <em>heh</em>, which together spell <em>Yah</em> meaning G-d.</li>
<li>&quot;G-d is fully present only when masculine and feminine are both present.&quot; (Zohar)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Yah, where shall I find You?
High and hidden is Your Place;
And where shall I not find You?
Your Presence fills Time and Space.
I have sought Your nearness,
With all my heart I called You!
And going out to meet You,
I found You coming toward me.
[Yehudah HaLevi]

<ul>
<li>‘Not-Two’</li>
<li>To name frames a relationship</li>
<li>Hebrew letters and syllables express the essence of something, and creates it</li>
<li>G-d is not a name but a description of one role / aspect {event}</li>
<li><em>Eheyeh asher eheyeh</em> = existence unfolding. “I am the Oneness that lives and points towards life.”</li>
<li>Tikkunei “No thought at all can grasp G-d.” (Zohar)</li>
</ul>
<p>[Why say <em>Eheyeh asher eheyeh</em> then on that occasion? The people were going to have to believe possible all kinds of things outside of their past experiences or current understandings. They would have to entertain new possibilities, become something new themselves – evolve. The name given was a teaching – to be prepared for the new, the unexpected. The people must be in the image of this aspect of G-d – willingness to be different, go somewhere new, take a different shape, have no strategic plan or future goals. This reminds us that G-d can be different for the needs of the moment, new to each person and generation. And we must be too.]</p>

<ul>
<li>Every time we breathe, we breath the Name of G-d</li>
<li>To attempt G-d’s Name is to breathe life<br>
<em>Aleph</em> – <strong>YHVH</strong> and <em>Aleph</em>: unity and infinity</li>
<li>Rabbi Levi Yitzchak – Says Isaiah: “Peace to the one who is far and peace to the one who is near.” For one whose soul is in balance realizes that s/he is far from G-d, yet at the same time knows that s/he is near to G-d. [We feel] trembling awe when we think of G-d as utterly beyond. But from the sense that G-d is close, love arises. {Yet it is precisely from that sens of G-d as beyond, that we come to realise how close He really Is. }</li>
<li>Human heart = ‘Temple’ for <em>Shechinah</em> (in-dwelling presence of G-d)</li>
<li>G-d is outside (transcendent) and within us (immanent) {One could say G-d is everywhere (immanent), yet utterly beyond us (transcendent)}</li>
<li><em>Aleph</em> = hand beckoning downwards from G-d, and the hand of G-d in us reaching back and upwards.</li>
<li><em>Adonai­</em> – a fountain of blessings are You, whose Name is <em>Adonai</em>.</li>
<li>Address G-d with an attribute (e.g. <em>Brich rachamana malka d’alma marei d’ahi pitta</em> – the Compassionate One Ruler of the universe, maker of the bread)</li>
<li><em>Yotzeir</em> = making from something;</li>
<li><em>Borei</em> = create from nothing;</li>
<li><em>HaRachaman</em>, The Merciful One. <em>rechem</em> = womb; , Source of Life; <em>Ein Sof</em>, the Limitless, without End; <em>Chei Ha-Olamim</em>, Life Force of Time and Space; <em>El Elyon</em>, the Most High; <em>Ma’ayan Raz</em>, the Mysterious Well; <em>Goel</em>, Saving Power; <em>Atika Kadisha</em>, The Ancient Holy One; <em>Yah</em>, Breath of Life; <em>El Ro’i</em>, G-d Who Sees Me; <em>HaMakom, the Place of the World, or the Place we go to; _HaShem</em> the Name.</li>
<li><em>Adon</em>, as One with ‘craft’, mastery over Creation</li>
<li>We are the means by which the Master Craftsman expresses Himself [I like Zalman’s gender-neutral term ‘G-d-self’]</li>

<li>G-d is both expansive and contracting, <strong>chesed</strong>. This is the kabbalistic interpretation of Ps. 84:12 _Ki shemesh v’magein, ­<strong>YHVH</strong> Eloheinu _ “For the Lord G-d is a sun and a shield.” The phrase in the <em>amidah</em> – _hagadol v’hagibor _– incorporates both sides (<em>gibor</em> shares the same root as <em>gevurah</em>)</li>
<li>G-d is context and content, creating from the outside, and sustaining from the inside. {Both inside and outside (and everything inbetween)}</li>
<li><em>Elohim</em> = <em>Aleph</em> G-d <em>lamed</em> channelled <em>heh</em> into life and <em>yud</em> toward <em>mem</em>- abundant generosity</li>
<li><em>Gevurah</em> [firm boundedness] is, like <em>Chesed</em>, a source of love<br>
