	<h3>Description:</h3>
	<p>The people of Israel have embraced the new order with a voraciousness that is scary...</p>

<h2 id="science-will-save-us!" tabindex="-1">Science will save us! <a class="direct-link" href="#science-will-save-us!" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The sheep, without a shepherd, wandering in the wilderness.<br>
You thought the ancient teachings were no longer relevant. That we were beyond slavery. We survived the holocaust. Six million had perished, and we had flourished. If we could survive that, we could survive anything. In addition, we bred our offspring to embrace the brave cry of &quot;Never again!&quot;. And in our pride, we abandoned the old ways, and embraced the new.</p>
<p>Science would save us. We could see into the furthest reaches of the universe, and imagine things unimaginable. We had opened the very womb of nature, and could mess with her offspring. We were like gods - of so we thought. Forgetting that this &quot;reality&quot; that we live in was here long before any of us were even a thought, and will be around long after we have been forgotten for many aeons.</p>
<p>Yes, my children, let us not acknowledge that their might - nay there has to be - a Creator of some nature. Somehow all this that we live and experience fell into place, and we are the conscious result of that. And you can convince yourself that it is an &quot;accident&quot; of .... nature - a nature that is itself a product of this very creation that we are exploring.</p>
