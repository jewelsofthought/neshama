<p>You cannot compete with the man - not in his territory, where he is strong. You have to lead him into the spaces that you (f) are powerful.</p>
<p>That is the Achilles heel of the feminine movement. If you want to prove that you are equal to man, you have to show equality in all things. If we do a basic analysis of this, we will find the woman will come up short in some very relevant cases. And if you do a basic analysis of man, you will find he will come up short in some cases too.</p>
<p>But if the woman wants to equal the man in power, she will have a difficult fight. Because he is more physically powerful than her. The feminine's purpose is not power, whereas it is a drive of the masculine's.</p>
<p>If you fight me, we both lose. If you nourish me, we both win.</p>
<p>I know it is the same for you.</p>
